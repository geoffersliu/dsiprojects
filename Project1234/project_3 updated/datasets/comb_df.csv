t3_gjnn7e,personalfinance,Overwhelmed By My Finances &amp; Getting Forceful Advice From Others,"So, the overview: I'm an out of work cook with ~$70k in student loan debt  ($15k of it in default from Perkins Loans) and mental blocks that have kept me from really committing to a plan for my finances for a while. Credit is around 600 last I checked.  No emergency fund or savings (which is to say that I have $3k in my bank account since lockdown put a halt on many of my bills, but haven't had a long term plan to save over time).
  
The Car Problem  
My 20 year old car has done great, but is springing leaks like a cartoon rowboat and my family has been after me to commit to a ~$10k car loan to get a car and improve my credit at the same time. I need a car that can get me across multiple states sometimes, and mine has been good so far, minus literally everything that can leak now leaking. 

I think the idea of committing myself to a $280 car payment (rate I got) and adding $10k in debt, especially now that I'm out of work and not likely to return without a HUGE career shift, is insane (even at my best, I make $13/hr plus tips).  
The understanding is that I'm so unreliable, they'll have to pay the car payment anyway, or that it's better that the car is in my name in case something happens to my dad, and they're offering $3k to help with a down payment. With this understanding, there has been nothing but argument over the specifics of the car for going on a year. Price, and they have strong opinions about my choice of car as well. The $3k is obviously conditional on my choosing a car and situation that they want for me. 

I feel like if I'm doing anything with $10k, it's going to be to figure out how to pay off those ($15k) defaulted loans before September 30th, while interest and collections are paused. Dad is saying I need to just dispute the debt for however long it takes to make it go away, despite me telling him that I've already confirmed it's my debt over the phone, and that I thought the stress of trying to dispute a debt I'm objectively responsible for wasn't worth it.   
I'm not against the idea in principle (since I only actually took out $10k in loans and 1.5x that seems excessive, why not screw The Man?), but I think I just want to move on with my life.  

As for getting a higher salary, after which I'd happily take on a car payment, most of my options would take me out of the country (once that's an option). Picking fruit in New Zealand, teaching English in South Korea or Vietnam. Both would make more than what I've been doing. 
 Alternatively, a cheaper education in Norway or Germany with a part time job could be a better long term investment than a $10k car. (I've been thinking about getting my MBA and going into imports/exports of seafood or something like that, but I haven't figured out a career path there yet).  

Any advice or perspective on this situation would be really helpful. I'm just not seeing the forest for the trees right now and don't know what the right call with my money is. (And when you have so little of it, every decision is stressful!) 

Thank you in advance!","Overwhelmed By My Finances &amp; Getting Forceful Advice From OthersSo, the overview: I'm an out of work cook with ~$70k in student loan debt  ($15k of it in default from Perkins Loans) and mental blocks that have kept me from really committing to a plan for my finances for a while.

My 2. interview went well, business case not as much as I have no background in it","Hi, so I with public affairs background had a second round of an interview as a regional lead in 3 Eastern European markets for an ecommerce company. My advantage (not a requirement in the posting) is that I speak all three languages.  However no business school or ecommerce experience (required). The rest of the requirements I fulfill.

I had a one hour interview with my future boss, he seemed kind and smiling during the interview, i think i answered the questions well, even the more technical ones, he saw that I have done my research and tried hard.

The business case went okay, I watched hours of videos but obviously I made mistakes, he had to correct me or question my calculations a few times, I got stuck/confused once,I admitted I haven't done a business case before but I really enjoyed it. I came to a conclusion in the end, but what matters more is my analytical thinking.

The second part was with his colleague, it was cut shorter (first one got prolonged), he seemed a bit more distant, I'm not sure I convinced him, I was also quite brain dead after an hour of interview anyway.

My friend said to maybe offer taking only 70-80% of salary for the first 2-3 months while i get the hang of the business side. I've never heard of this, but she said her employer liked the idea. Maybe as an ecommerce startup that reached one billion, they could appreciate my flexibility and this offer to compromise. Thoughts? Is it desperate/needy or is it a creative approach to deal with my gap?

Edit: I have asked my 1. Interviewer if he sees any reservations regarding me as an applicant and he said no, not really, but I'd have to undertake quite a steep learning curve in the beginning in case I'm hired. He sounded positive and honest but then again it all depends on other candidates.","Has anyone offered 20-30% of their salary for the first XY months while they have the learn-in period?

t3_gjmzyv,personalfinance,Is it irresponsible to rent at this price?,"Hey guys,

My net pay (after taxes) per month is: $4,137.94

I live in NYC and the place I'm looking to rent is in a luxury building. The rent is $1350 per month (discounted due to pandemic), and the utility bills will be anywhere between $70-$100 per month.

I do not have any debt. My only consistent after tax recurring expenses are groceries which amount to about $450 per month, and Roth IRA contributions at $568 per month.

Trasporation is covered via an FSA in which I allocate $127 per month from my pay check (Will modify since I don't use public transportation currently). And I automatically deposit $984.86 into a 401K (10% annual salary with employer matching 75% up to 6% and maxing HSA annually).

The lease would be for 10 months at which time I would could renew or leave. I have made rough calculation in which I would be paying about 35% of net pay on rent, closer to 44% once utilities are included.

My question is to get thoughts from the community even though the quality of life would be significantly better, especially during times like these: ""Is this is fically irresponsible?""

t3_gjmvz2,personalfinance,Questions in advance for Roth 401(k) tranfer,"Hi all,

I’m in the position where I know I’ll be leaving my company within the next 6 months and I’d like some help understanding what my options are for handling my Roth 401(k) when the time to leave/move it arrives.

Couple more details:

- For my Roth 401(k) I contributed the minimum to attain maximum company match
- I have a Roth IRA

- I have a Roth IRA
- I have a taxable portfolio account

t3_gjmvv1,personalfinance,"Started a job without realizing I was already approved for unemployment, worried for my very immune compromised parent. Could really use some advice.","Hello friends, in a bit of a pickle. I was laid off from a paid part-time internship in mid March, moved back home with my parents when in-person classes were cancelled to help take care of my father who is battling cancer. I applied for unemployment in mid April but with 18 credit hours of online class finishing up and my father starting a new chemo treatment life has just been kind of a blur the last month or so and I’m kind of just now getting my head straight. 

My savings were basically depleted from not working from mid March-early May, so I got a job as fast as I could figuring I hadn’t been eligible for unemployment since i never got a letter in the mail or an email saying I had been (this is the f*** up). I started working about a week ago as a temporary employee at a large grocery chain. I wear two masks to work and use hand sanitizer any chance I get, but the general public does not usually take those same precautions. My father was denied his chemo treatment today due to his white blood cell count being too low and was told to be extra careful to make sure not to get sick as any infection could send him to the hospital. This prompted me to log into my states (MI) unemployment website and lo and behold I found a letter there saying I was approved for 39 weeks of unemployment by my state before I even started my job. I also missed the first window for certification according to the determination letter. This means instead of potentially risking my parents lives by going to work everyday I could’ve been paid more to stay home and help my father. Is there anything I can do? I’ve been calling the unemployment number nonstop since the second they opened this morning with no luck yet. Thank you all in advance. 


TL;DR: Applied for unemployment, never got anything saying I was approved and figured I didn’t qualify. Got a relatively dangerous job living with an immune compromised parent, turns out I was eligible for unemployment benefits before I was hired. wondering what to do next?","Started a job without realizing I was already approved for unemployment, worried for my very immune compromised parent.

t3_gjmlga,personalfinance,URGENT Tax question!!!! (Panicking here),"From last year's taxes, I realized I owed my state money because I wasn't withholding enough (I'm a 25 y/o single female).

It looks like while my SC state tax withheld *increased* (from $203.87 to $222.56), my federal taxes withheld *decreased* from ($505.43 to $466.01) Why is this, and should I revert back to the withholding I had before?","URGENT Tax question!!!!

I'm a 23 year old opera singer, about to finish my 4 year undergraduate degree in vocal performance and heading onto a masters in September. The typical route of a singer in the UK is to train for 8 years(roughly) while gaining experience etc. while you develop your vocal technique and knowledge. Even after those 8 years, paid work is extremely hard to come by for many years.

During this lockdown, my current lack of financial security has made me realise the importance of finding another source of income or qualification that will allow me to stay afloat until I can make enough from singing alone. Or if the singing does not work out, to fully commit to this second career.

I would love some advice on job suggestions, qualifications, training courses, or anything of the sort which will allow me to have options. I don't mind how long these course take or what is required, but preferably something that isn't a full-time course. I just ultimately would like to not get down the line in 5 years time, find out I won't make enough money from singing, and have to have this conversation with my self when I have a lot more bills to pay and a lot my student debt.

t3_gjmchj,personalfinance,Currently paying two separate leases and not sure if there are any other options.,"Hi PF!

Context: In February, 2020 I accepted an offer to work at a new company in NYC. Currently living in Houston, TX.
My original start date was April, and I managed to find an apartment in the city in the first week of March and signed my lease quickly. At the time, my plan was to break my current lease in Houston and move the first week of April.



Unfortunately, as I’m sure you can tell by the timing, I had to postpone my move across the country due to the current lockdown.
As of right now, I’m currently paying rent for my apartment in Houston (where I will most likely be for the next month or two), and ALSO, paying rent for my apartment in NYC (which I haven’t even set foot in, yet...)

The NYC leasing office gave me the option to fill out an application to restructure the lease payment and provide some flexibility there, but unfortunately it is solely dependent on my “Loss of income due to the quarantine ”, which, I don’t necessarily qualify for—because I’m being paid normally as I work from home here in TX.

Just a quick note regarding “why don’t you just break the lease of one or the other?”, the Houston apartment is charging me 4-months rent upfront to give a 60-day notice, and the NYC apartment lease states I have to pay 3 months rent up front to give a 60 day notice. Both of which I will still have to pay the residual months (in the 60&amp; 90 day windows of my leaving.... which is a huge chunk of cheddar)



I predict I’m SOL, but figured there might be other clever and legal ways around this.

Misc/random necessities-$400

First time here but my friend said this place is a great community.  Many thanks in advance for any help you might be able to offer.

I'm looking to buy a house this summer.  I'm at the point of getting a pre-approval and have decided that an 80/10/10 loan is probably best for me.  First time home buyer, 800+ credit score, and just enough to put 10% down for a house in my price range.  After doing some rough math I'm certain I can afford the two mortgages - the 2nd mortgage is practically what I would be paying in PMI anyways.

My question is, how does one actually get pre-approved for an 80/10/10 loan?  It's my understanding that often the two loans are from different banks, is this correct?  Would it be best/easiest to use a mortgage broker?  If I go the broker route, and chose a lender paid broker, does that mean I effectively get their services for free?  Or would that just mean I'm paying either higher closings costs or will have a higher rate with a with a loan from a broker that's lender paid?

Thanks and please let me know if I should elaborate or provide any other details.","How to get a 80/10/10 (Piggy Back) Loan?Hello,

I think I’d prefer to keep the money in a 401k plan, whether I keep it in the old employer’s account or roll it over to the new one.

So I guess the question is do I keep it in the old account or roll it into my new employer’s plan, and why? What is the “best practice” for when I eventually switch jobs again in the future?

t3_gjkn60,personalfinance,Maryland &amp; Pennsylvania - 401k Deductible Income,"Hi all,

First time poster here and not too knowledgeable about taxes, so I apologize if my question has been previously discussed or if it doesn’t make sense. 

I lived in Maryland until 5/1 this year, and due to the pandemic, I’ve had to move back home to Pennsylvania. During these 4 months while living in Maryland, I maxed out my traditional IRA ($6k) and traditional 401k ($19.5k). 

While currently living in Pennsylvania, I’m still working in Maryland. I understand that these states have a reciprocity, so I will have to file a return in PA, not MD, for the amount of time that I live in PA during all of this.

I just learned that traditional IRA and traditional 401k contributions are not deductible from income in PA in the year of contribution.

My question to you is will I still be able to deduct these contributions ($25.5k) from my income if I continue to live in PA until the end of the year, since I made them during the 4 months while I was living in Maryland? 

Also, on a different topic that I’m just curious about, but I’m probably missing something - wouldn’t it make sense for all PA residents to contribute to a Roth 401k and Roth IRA since traditional contributions are not deductible in PA?

I apologize if my questions do not make sense - I just stumbled upon this info and would appreciate clarification!

t3_gjj8rh,personalfinance,A dozen years of over contributing to a Roth IRA,"tldr: My friend has been over contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and needs to know what to do.

\--

My friend and I somehow got onto the topic of the Retirement Savings Credit and I mentioned that he should plug his Roth IRA contribution into Turbo Tax to see if he qualifies for it.  Much to our surprise, inputting the Roth IRA contribution actually did the opposite, it led to an increase in the amount owed.  Before this year he had always done his taxes by hand.

Upon some investigating we found that that the income limit  for Roth IRA contributions is $10,000 (?!) for someone who files married but separately (and actually live together).  His income is well above $10k.

So now my friend is starting to freak out a bit because he then tells me he has been contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and has been filing married/separately the entire time (his wife has student loan issues).

He doesn't keep his paperwork for anything really but estimates that he has been investing approximately $3,000 each year and his income has always been above $10k.

So what is he looking at?  6% penalty on each and every single $3,000 contribution for each and every single year?  That's like $14,000 in penalties, right?  For $36,000 in contributions that seems pretty steep.

Then he would still have to take all this money out of the Roth IRA, right?  So he would have to pay a 10% penalty and income taxes on the earnings (since he does not seem to have a qualified exception)?

He has no idea what his gains are but if we assume $10k in gains that could be $1,000 in a 10% penalty and, say, $1,500 in 2020 income taxes (not sure his tax rate, but let's just say 15%).

So now he has to pay the $14,000ish in contribution penalty and $2,500 in penalties and taxes on the earnings, so $16,500 in total?

Please someone tell me that we are wrong in our understanding of the consequences on his contributions!  This seems ridiculously harsh.  He has a call out to an accountant but who knows when he'll actually be able to go in for an appointment with this lockdown we are in.  

\--

For what it's worth his financial manager, who made very clear he cannot give out tax advice, said he should just leave it and play dumb if the IRS ever comes calling.","A dozen years of over contributing to a Roth IRAtldr: My friend has been over contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and needs to know what to do.

t3_gjigua,personalfinance,Can I Open A Roth IRA While Unemployed?,"Hi,

First off, huge thanks to everyone who created this subreddit and contribute to people's posts. I've been lurking and reading and I've found alot of helpful information.

I left my W-2 job at the end of the second week of January. Since then I've been an IC; I got paid one day as a production assistant for a huge event. I've also worked on one small project, but that barely made me around $125. I've been approved for UI benefits, and plan to use those funds to pay off credit card debt (around $2K), and I have money ready to put in an high-yield savings account as an emergency fund.

I'm 27, finished graduate school last year, and my graduate student loans are currently deferred. I'm living at home, and my monthly expenses are around $700 for now. I'm looking for full-time work at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can I still open a Roth IRA and use the funds from my W-2 job to contribute to 2019?
2. If so, I'm debating between Fidelity and Schwab, any insights on who to go with based on my profile? I'm very new to all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that I wouldn't be able to contribute to 2020 until I earn income apart from unemployment.

Any insights are greatly appreciated; thank you!

Edit: I also read about Schwab acquiring TD...do you think this would give Schwab a leg up?

Edit #2: Thanks to those who have replied so far! For 2020, since I've been an IC, how can I show the small income I've made? Paystubs? Invoices?","Can I Open A Roth IRA While Unemployed?Hi,

t3_gjhxeo,personalfinance,"If I was laid off with no return date and pay in lieu of notice, I was technically terminated, right?","Hi, sorry for the length here. Just trying to get some actual understanding behind my layoff as it's been very hard to find clarification. I was laid off (""indefinitely"" they said) at the end of March due to Covid, with no return date listed on my notice of separation. They also provided a check for two weeks of pay and checked the box on the NOS that said they were providing Pay In Lieu Of Notice. Almost everyone got laid off at the same time, minus a few ""essential"" people. So this means I was actually terminated, am I correct? 


I'm curious because they're starting to call some of us (oddly not all of us or any of our upper management but myself included) to ask if we want to come back. I was previously the head cashier, but when they called me they offered a general cashier position, not my previous one, and another prior coworker told me they offered her a different position as well. I'm also concerned because with school out and my normal babysitter high risk thus self isolating, I'm currently the primary caregiver for my special needs child, so it's impossible for me to currently return to work until either school's return or I have access to his babysitter (he's comfortable around her and she's got experience with his particular delays). Daycare isn't really a feasible option for us for a few reasons, and many here are still closed down.

Currently in my state we're waived from having to do job searches as we just opened back up and our cases are still increasing by up to 36% or more a week.","If I was laid off with no return date and pay in lieu of notice, I was technically terminated, right?Hi, sorry for the length here. Just trying to get some actual understanding behind my layoff as it's been very hard to find clarification. I was laid off (""indefinitely"" they said) at the end of March due to Covid, with no return date listed on my notice of separation. They also provided a check for two weeks of pay and checked the box on the NOS that said they were providing Pay In Lieu Of Notice. Almost everyone got laid off at the same time, minus a few ""essential"" people. So this means I was actually terminated, am I correct? 


I'm curious because they're starting to call some of us (oddly not all of us or any of our upper management but myself included) to ask if we want to come back. I was previously the head cashier, but when they called me they offered a general cashier position, not my previous one, and another prior coworker told me they offered her a different position as well. I'm also concerned because with school out and my normal babysitter high risk thus self isolating, I'm currently the primary caregiver for my special needs child, so it's impossible for me to currently return to work until either school's return or I have access to his babysitter (he's comfortable around her and she's got experience with his particular delays). Daycare isn't really a feasible option for us for a few reasons, and many here are still closed down.

t3_gjhepv,personalfinance,"$30k in up to date debt, $17k in collections -- wondering if I should start a Debt Management Plan and settle for 50% of the loan currently in collections?","Hi there! I am hoping to get some advice regarding my current debt situation. Yes, I am $47k in debt and obviously very concerned about it. I moved to Los Angeles a year and a half ago, and was unable to find a job as quickly as I expected -- in the year it took to find one, I blew through my savings and took out a few loans in order to keep my head above water (I WAS working at the time -- I commuted weekly to San Diego to work 30 hours a week at my last job there, but it wasn't enough). The 17k loan was basically a refinance of an earlier large loan from a different creditor. Because I was unable to find a job for so long, I defaulted on this loan (choosing to stay current on my other loans/credits in order to continue having a good relationship with my credit union) and it was sent to collections last December.

&amp;nbsp;

I was sent a letter in April from American Recovery Service Inc. claiming they now had my debt and offering to settle for 50% of the amount due ($17087 &gt; $8500). I missed the 21 day deadline to respond due to the hectic stress of the pandemic, and am wondering it its worth it to reach out to them. From what I've gathered while doing research, settlements usually mean you pay everything right then and there... which I obviously can't.

&amp;nbsp;

I reached out to a nonprofit credit counseling company and had them look at my debt. They sent me a Debt Management Plan that claims I will be paid off on my debt in 3 years, but this does NOT include the loan that is in collections. I emailed the company back asking why the loan in collections was not included and if they are doing anything to help out their clients affected by the pandemic. My credit agency is pushing back due dates and willing to work with me when I get behind, and I'm not sure that would also be possible with the DMP. The DMP monthly payment would be $968.

&amp;nbsp;

My credit was actually really good before my loan payments fell behind, and I know it's likely shit now. I've been too scared to check it...

&amp;nbsp;

Current Bills:

- $1400 Rent
- $75 Electricity/Trash
- $35 Gas
- $50 Internet
- $85 Car Insurance
- $115 Health Insurance
- $235 Car Payment ($3070 left on car loan, car is 6 years old and in great shape)
- $250 Personal Loan 1 ($8870 left, 16.35% interest rate)
- $170 Personal Loan 2 ($5930 left, 16.35% interest rate)
- $260 Credit Card ($12930 balance, 13% interest rate)
- $60 Care Credit Line ($1700 balance, 14.9% interest rate)
- $80 Cell Phone
- $75 Cat related expenses


&amp;nbsp;

Total: $2900 before food/gas/etc

&amp;nbsp;

Total with Lending Club Loan, not included above: $3350

&amp;nbsp;

I was lucky enough to land a job in October, then another in December, so from end of December through March I was working 70-80 hours per week (because of the debt I stupidly incurred). I work in hospitality though, and both of my hotels closed the same day due to COVID-19. I am currently on Unemployment.

&amp;nbsp;

Income After Taxes/month (before COVID-19): $4000, at the least
Income After Taxes/month (EDD): $3000

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, EDD bases your eligibility on the first four of the last five quarters.... and I made half of what I did at the most during that time. I have been meaning to call them to see if they will change it to what I made in the 5th quarter and this backpay me for the difference, but I'm not holding my breath that they will agree. I will likely not return to work until July. I wish I could say that I put a lot towards savings during these three months, but I had a few other debts I needed to pay off and expenses I could not avoid.

&amp;nbsp;

If it helps, I am single and live alone. My family are all living barely above the poverty line, and have all left the state. Due to my career, I have to stay in LA.

&amp;nbsp;

Tldr: I am wondering if it is worth it to contact the collections agency that currently owns my $17k loan and try to settle it for half off (and if they will do payment plans?) or what other options I have besides ignoring it and hoping for the best. I am also wondering if a debt management plan is a smart choice to pay down my other debt.

t3_gjhbbx,personalfinance,What should I do about this debt collection?,"I received a collection agency call about a debt I have. It’s a $90 medical office bill from like 3-4 years ago. When I first received the bill, I tried to dispute it with the clinic because they miss-billed my insurance. Eventually they stopped sending me statements and I forgot about the whole thing. Anyways, I got a call about it from a collections agency. More specifically, I’ve been ignoring the call from the collections agency for a few months. I ran my credit report today and there haven’t been any collection dings on it so I don’t think they’ve reported it.. I still don’t agree with the bill and don’t really want to pay it. These are my arguments for not paying them:

I have excellent credit (700-800 range) so if they were to report it, my score won’t ultimately suffer much. But also if it did, I’m not making any big purchases in the near future. Maybe not even in the next 7 years.

I don’t think they would take me to court to try to garnish wages, because it’s a small sum and filing for small court is like a $40 fee plus lawyer fees. But if they did, I guess they can have the $90 then. Not sure if the margin is worth it.

On the other hand, I would keep getting these phone calls. Can’t block the number since it’s always different, but I could send them a cease and desist letter at which point I think they’d have to. 

OR maybe it would be best to just pay them? I don’t know. Am I right about the above things?

t3_gjhayp,personalfinance,Renting out my primary residence in another state? USA/SC/NC,"Hey all,
I just bought a house in upstate South Carolina in December.
It is my first home and I am now faced with an opportunity of free housing in NC, still close to my job in SC.
My girlfriend’s parents are leaving for California and are leaving the home to her for us to live in.
We won’t have to pay anything.
I want to rent out my house as I’ll be able to pay for it even while it’s vacant, I’m not concerned about our relationship, my job or the worst case of being “kicked out” as I could afford more in housing. I made $80k last year with projected $130k (basicly guaranteed) in the coming 3 years. My home is $135k so I feel comfortable having to make the occasional payment on both my rental and another housing situation (rent/another home, depending on time) for several months at a time. I’ve also saved $10k as an emergency savings which I may increase?

All my questions are regarding what do I need to know renting out my only primary residence?

Will my taxes change for the whole year?

How do I go about making it into a rental, legally?

It’s all come pretty quickly. We’d move in the house in about a month and I just want to know all that I might need to know?

Me and her will be splitting the income in the meantime until we potentially marry.
I’m on a 20 year mortgage at 3.25apr so I’m not exactly looking to make a profit over the payment. Just to make the monthly mortgage or more then share half.


Edit: House is built in 2000, 2000sqft
so not too old and decently sized.
I’m about replace the Air handler. Everything else is brand new basically.

I’m a qualified electrician, comfortable with plumbing and have my EPA Universal Refrigerant license. So any general facility maintenance I’m comfortable doing the work myself.","Renting out my primary residence in another state? USA/SC/NCHey all,

t3_gjh4wl,personalfinance,To pay or not to pay...,"I'm a teacher with current $26k in federal student loans from my master's degeee (that the system required me to get to move up a measly pay scale). I've done the math a million times and no matter the feds service loan forgiveness programs, etc. I am still in the end going to pay a ridiculous amount more than I ever borrowed and contine to pay a good chunk of my income towards it every month until then. (They should be forgiving me $17,500 already, but they find trivial technicalities to deny me and forgive nothing.)

Anyway, recently I sold my place and made a nice profit. And since Covid, they've dropped my interest rate to 0% with no payment or penalty till September. I'm tempted to just pay it all off in full with my earnings and save thousands in interest and not have that monthly payment in my life. Just put it behind me and move on.

Yet, I'm hesitant because of all the buzz about a massive loan forgiveness bill for Americans. I'd hate to give them the $26k just to learn later had I not, I could have had no loans and kept the money in my own pocket.

I've done the math a million times and no matter the feds service loan forgiveness programs, etc. I am still in the end going to pay a ridiculous amount more than I ever borrowed and contine to pay a good chunk of my income towards it every month until then. (They should be forgiving me $17,500 already, but they find trivial technicalities to deny me and forgive nothing.)

Anyway, recently I sold my place and made a nice profit. And since Covid, they've dropped my interest rate to 0% with no payment or penalty till September. I'm tempted to just pay it all off in full with my earnings and save thousands in interest and not have that monthly payment in my life. Just put it behind me and move on.

Yet, I'm hesitant because of all the buzz about a massive loan forgiveness bill for Americans. I'd hate to give them the $26k just to learn later had I not, I could have had no loans and kept the money in my own pocket.

This is extraordinarily generous. There was no screaming either. The support person’s kindness reverberated over the phone. There was maybe a 2 minute call wait.

t3_gjft5a,personalfinance,Should I lower my credit card amount or keep it the same for better credit after lots of debt?,"I have a 3200 and a 2100 credit card. I have been in bad shape with these and got myself into debt with 100 percent credit utilisation and some missed payments.

I will not be using them so could lower it but not sure what would be better for my credit rating. It is currently poor and I am trying to get it to at least the low end of good.

I will also have enough to use for a deposit on a mortgage once a house sale has gone through, although I'm aware it may take a couple of years before any mortgage company will be willing to lend me even if I do have a high deposit of 30K??

And if it matters at all, I live around Long Beach, CA.

So my situation is this. I was furloughed from my part-time, barely-above-minimum-wage job recently due to the COVID pandemic. This is kind of okay for me, it gives me more time to do homework and the government is giving me WAY MORE money than I was originally making so I'm actually going to be saving money 5 times as fast as when I was working. Problem is, I'm at the point where I think it would be financially irresponsible for me to get a temporary full time job over the summer (which was my original plan before all this happened).

My second issue is that my rental history is not great. I'm still on a lease in San Francisco with my old roommates who refused to change the lease when I had to leave in July of last year. We never, ever had an issue with paying rent or bills on time while I lived there. But since moving out, they have paid the rent late multiple times AND no one currently has put the gas and electric bill in their name since I took mine off, so PG&amp;E has been sending the bill to collections since August, marring everyone's credit. There is nothing I can really do at this point, none of them will listen to me and the management company in charge of the old house will not let me out of the month to month lease unless everyone in the house either moves out or signs a new year-long lease, which my old roommates will not do. (Never move in with strangers you met on Craigslist, kids.)

My final issue is that I have no credit history other than the collections. I wasn't dumb enough to get a credit card as a teenager and it just never came up again until now. This was dumb and all my bad. I do, however, have over $10k saved up in the bank and will have over $12k at the end of the month.

However, the two friends that I am planning on moving in with do have good credit. One of them is over 600 and the other one is over 700. One with no rental history and just moving out of his parent's place and one has good rental history.

My main question is how do we go about this when I've fucked up so badly? Are we going to have to have a cosigner, and does that always mean we'll have to pay higher rent? A higher security deposit is fine, I have the money, but am I even eligible to sign a lease? I know I'll be okay financially once we get a place, I'm very good with my money, but I don't know how to convince a potential landlord or management company of that.

t3_gjflzb,personalfinance,Debt Collection Agency Won't Accept My Payment -- Even in Full.,"Hi all, first time poster here. I'd be very appreciative of any advice, or any direction to other reddit threads that this would better fit in. So, I'm trying to work on my credit and noticed I had some things in collection. I called all of the collection agencies today and paid them off in full, except for one collection agency, Credit Collection Services located in Norwood, MA. They literally wouldn't let me make a payment, because they're ""not allowed to service my account due to the corona virus."" They wouldn't even give me any information regarding my account, stating that they ""literally can't service my account"" or tell me when I'd be able to. They said I could mail in a payment but that they don't know when it would be processed or I could call again at a future date, again stating that they can't service my account. It was super frustrating, as I'm trying to take care of my credit so I can rent a house. If their reason is that it's because there's been some law/order directed by the Governor of Nevada (where I'm located) restricting them from accepting a payment, why was I able to make payments to a few other debt collection agencies?

t3_gjfhc7,personalfinance,ELAN Financial services attacking my credit,"Hello,

I normally don't really check my credit because nothing is going on, I'm not looking for loans and haven't had the need to apply for credit in several years. I recently got a warning that my credit is negatively affected by an account listed as ELAN financial services (actually 90 days late). I immediately disputed it with the credit reporting agencies as I have never heard of ELAN, and assumed it is a scam of some sort.

I did also call a number for ELAN I could find on the web, but their phone system is horrible. I called countless times, and I get nowhere. I never received any communication by mail or phone from them either. They acknowledge that I have an account based on my social security which I begrudgingly gave one of these people, even though I feel like I was helping scammers, and my trust was immediately betrayed as after giving the person my ssn they promptly refused to give me any information in return (they cannot tell me anything about the account for security reasons, but now they got my SSN). They said that if I made a payment to them right then, they will talk to a supervisor about getting me the account number. I'm not falling for that. I asked them how they could possibly do this to me, and they said its because I have a ""converted account"". I don't know what that means. The amount of money they want is tiny (200 USD roughly), but I'm not about to be extorted/robbed for that. After that episode I reported this scam operation to the consumer protection agency here in CA.  


I guess now all I can do is wait. Are there any other steps I can take to get this cleared up? It insanely bothers me, that these people can do this to me, and I have no rights/means of control here.","ELAN Financial services attacking my creditHello,

The agent explained that the fees are much lower than using other investors who would be dinging us with transaction fee after transaction fee, thus totaling far greater than with them. With Matson, it's explained, the investment remain nearly unchanged, thus we have little to no additional fees.

t3_gjf8k7,personalfinance,Recent Grad Moving to NYC - Need Budgeting Help,"Hey all, I am a 2020 college grad who (assuming Corona doesn't change anything) will be moving to NYC in August to start a full time job. I'm looking to budget and will give all info below, please help out if you can.

Salary: $57,000 annual salary, OT eligible. Additional $3,000 paid in the first paycheck (not up front). I'm assuming after a 31% total tax rate I'll have in the ballpark of $3,270 per month, not inc. the bonus.

Savings: I'll be going into the move with about $8,000 in savings assuming I'll be able to get a part time job for the rest of the summer before the move. This plus the bonus (at 31% tax) gives me just over $10,000 liquid. I also have a $2,500 line of credit with zero current balance, and I'd rather use savings than credit to finance the move.

Expenses:
Rent: Looking at the housing market in NYC, I believe I can get a studio in the range of $1,250/ month without living in a shady area. I think $1350 (inc. utilities/ internet/ laundry) has to be my hard cap, and as much as I'm likely looking for something that doesn't exist, I'd like to be as close to work as possible and not have to deal with roommates. This may be better suited for a NYC sub, but is this all reasonable?

Student Loans: The absolute monkey wrench in all of this. I went to a larger school as a first generation student and financed it almost entirely on loans. Starting in December 2020 I'll be paying $1,265 per month for the foreseeable future. My parents have said they'll do a 2/3rds split (meaning I'll only pay $820) but I'd rather plan to pay the whole thing in case they back out.

Other Expenses: this is another part that I'm pretty clueless on. Is budgeting $400 a month for food fair? I'm a pretty good cook and can make do with lots of pasta/ chicken/ cheap veggies, but at the same time I'm a big guy and can certainly eat a fair amount if given the opportunity; fast food adds up quick. There's also the subway pass at $127/ mo, and other assorted expenses (amazon, other travel/ fun money, taking care of a small pet, etc.)

Adding it all up I understand that I'm very close to my monthly limit, and this is with zero savings, zero investment into retirement, and limited ""fun money."" I know the loans are a lot, and trust me I know what I signed up for in that regard. But from a strictly budgeting standpoint, does this all add up? Am I missing anything, being unrealistic with some numbers, is there anything I can do to gain more income? Any help is appreciated, thanks to all in advance.","Recent Grad Moving to NYC - Need Budgeting HelpHey all, I am a 2020 college grad who (assuming Corona doesn't change anything) will be moving to NYC in August to start a full time job.

I recently received a letter from the IRS and a collection agency on their behalf in an attempt to collect a discrepancy of ~$1600 (now ~$2500 with penalties, fees and interest) from tax year 2010. I called the collection agency and asked for any information on the debt they've received from the IRS since this is the first I've heard of it and they referred me to the IRS website to get my tax record.

t3_gjeu8l,personalfinance,Left $19K on the table by messing up retirement election,"Going to keep this short. I'm sharing my story so others may learn from my mistake and because I just need to vent.

I've worked for pubic universities for the past 4 years. They offer teachers retirement (vested after 7 years) with long-term incentives and elective savings (vested in 3 years, match 8%).

At my first employer I opted for elective, knowing I likely wouldn't be there that long. At my second employer, I opted for the same - or so I thought.

Now, as I prepare to leave my employer in a month, I've realized that I've been both contributing to teachers retirement (7%) and two separate elective accounts (16% total).

Not only have I left free money on the table, I've been placing undue financial strain on myself these past 3 years, AND I'll be losing out on 100% of the employer-contributed funds from teachers retirement.

The problem is her parents have ingrained her decision that houses are end all be all, and that apartments are a waste of money. -\_- on the contrary to that I've done extensive research and see the pros and cons to both house and apartments but see the positive of how apartments can save money and allow us to work our way into living independently.

I don't think she realizes (correct me if I am wrong) but even if we see a realtor in the fall he will only consider my income since I will be able to prove I've been on my job for a year and a few months at that point and she would have been a long term sub for 6 months and had a full time teaching job at least a month or so.

I have two balance transfer offers available:

**Offer 1: 0% APR (12 months), 5% Transfer Fee**

**Offer 2: 6.99% APR (15 months), 0% Transfer Fee**

If I transfer $10,000 with the first offer I will pay a $500 flat transfer fee, making the total payoff amount $10,500 over 12 months which would require a minimum payment of $875/month to pay off the amount by the end of the introductory period.

t3_gjdpl8,personalfinance,Student loan refinance application rejected. Why?,"Hello, I recently graduated from college and decided to apply for refinancing of my student loans due to the current rates. Some background on my situation:

* I graduated last month and made sure to wait until all my grades came in to verify I graduated
* I luckily have a job secured that pays very well and allows me extra money to pay towards loans
* I only applied to have my private loans (approx. $25k) refinanced

I had to jump through a few hoops to prove I graduated and to verify my income but throughout the process my advisor at the loan company didn't raise any issues about my eligibility for a loan. I recently got an email saying that I was denied due to information they received from a credit reporting agency. The thing is, my credit score is really good (770). I have been building credit for the past 4 years with a credit card that I have never missed a payment on. I have also been making additional payments to my student loans while I was in school.

&amp;#x200B;

Would anyone know why my application could have been rejected? ~~They're saying they won't tell me specifically why.~~

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Their letter to me says that I ""did not meet program requirements"" followed by a description that consulting credit agencies partially or entirely resulted in their decision to deny me. Any idea what this means?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: I dove deeper on the student loan provider's website. These are their eligibility requirements for refinancing:

* Must be US citizen or Permanent Resident (I am)
* Must be age of majority or older (I am)
* Must have minimum loan amount of $15000 (I do)
* Must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher (I did)
* Must have minimum income of $35000 (I do)
* Must have minimum credit score of 680 (I do)
* Must have a minimum credit history of 36 months (I do)
* Must have a degree from an approved institution (I do according to their website)

The only thing I can think of is they think I didn't graduate. A few days ago they asked me to sign a form giving the ok for them to contact my school. Guess I have to reach out to my school and see what their issue is.","Student loan refinance application rejected.

t3_gjdnuf,personalfinance,"Account in collections in error, collections agency said they'll take care of it","Reposting since I didn't get an answer on /r/credit, hoping the fine folks of /r/personalfinance have some insight.

Last year in December, I was contacted by a collections agency about a deliquent account. At first, I thought they had the wrong number because I'm anal retentive about paying my bills in full and on time, but looked into it further and realized an old apartment complex made a mistake when I moved out and overcharged me for something that didn't appear on my account for several months. I had also received email confirmation that my account was settled and I would not be charged any further. When I called the apartment complex, they confirmed it was a mistake and said they would work with the collection agency to make sure I didn't get dinged. The agency seemed to recognize it as a mistake and stated that they would ""mark the account as paid in full and removed from your credit report."" They also stated it would be a few weeks until I'll see it reflected correctly on the reports.

I understand marking an account paid and removing the remark to be two different things - that marking an account as paid means that the debt was valid, and removing it means it won't show up at all. Can anyone offer insight and if I should push back on them to specifically remove it completely, or am I misunderstanding how this process works?

This has caused my credit score to tank like 100 points and I don't want it to be screwed up for longer than it has to be, especially since I've been contemplating buying a house.","Account in collections in error, collections agency said they'll take care of itReposting since I didn't get an answer on /r/credit, hoping the fine folks of /r/personalfinance have some insight.

t3_gjd0u6,personalfinance,Housing for the Upcoming Year,"Hello, all I am trying to figure out my situation for living for this next year and was wondering all of your advice. 

Basically, my girlfriend and I are talking about getting married in December or May. When we do, this will be the start of us living together (we won't until we do get married and we do want to have an actual wedding as much as we can with all that is going on). She is a student and has 1 year left and I am graduated and working full-time.

Essentially I am deciding to live with someone else and split the rent or live alone. It would be about $400 splitting but about $700-800+ on my own. To preface, I have a job where I make enough to support myself well. I make roughly $3400 a month after taxes. Right now I am probably paying $450 for everything in total.

If I choose to live alone, I am ready for either decision we make on when to get married. She can always just move into where I will be living. However, we may not end up getting married until May then I would basically be living alone until then and having to pay more money. She would come over, but I do not know how well that would end up working out for my own mental health and just finances in general managing it all.

The other option is I get a place with my friend and me until we get married. However, after we get married I will have to find someone to sublease me when I move out. When she moves out, we have to pay $300 off her rent a month until the lease ends next July. If we get married in December, I will have to find someone to sublease and we will have to find a place to live for 6 months until she graduates as we may move after that point. If I can't find a sublease,  that would be an extra $400 a month I would have to pay on top of my new rent and my GF's $300. And we would have to find a place with only like a 3-month lease. If we get married in May or summerish, I would move out and we would have to find a place only for the summer or we would have to move into the place I was already living until we knew where we would be for the next year, or I could ask my roommate to move home for a few months but I do not know if he would do that. It would just be a really hard situation.

Basically, if I move in with someone, we have a lot more things that we need to end up figuring out. But I could save a lot more money to help pay for a wedding over those months, regardless of when we decide to get married if I move in with someone.

Which is the smarter financial option? A better option in general?","Housing for the Upcoming YearHello, all I am trying to figure out my situation for living for this next year and was wondering all of your advice. 

Basically, my girlfriend and I are talking about getting married in December or May. When we do, this will be the start of us living together (we won't until we do get married and we do want to have an actual wedding as much as we can with all that is going on). She is a student and has 1 year left and I am graduated and working full-time.

Essentially I am deciding to live with someone else and split the rent or live alone. It would be about $400 splitting but about $700-800+ on my own. To preface, I have a job where I make enough to support myself well. I make roughly $3400 a month after taxes. Right now I am probably paying $450 for everything in total.

If I choose to live alone, I am ready for either decision we make on when to get married. She can always just move into where I will be living. However, we may not end up getting married until May then I would basically be living alone until then and having to pay more money.

Bought my first house in 2005: 1000 sq ft. Ranch 100K (Ohio)
80/20 Loan(s) no money down; primary loan adjustable interest rate, second loan interest only balloon
Got married had a family, could not sell, owed more than it's worth; decided to move to a bigger house and rent it out in 2014.
Now here is my problem, balloon is up (April 2020) owe 16K
primary adjustable has 60K balance (7%)
House is maybe worth 75K on the market based on recent sales in the neighborhood.
My mortgage is about $975/month; I charge $800/month
I know....but I cannot charge more than someone will pay and the neighborhood is not that great, ok....but not great.
I was hoping the neighborhood and home prices would turn around eventually and I could eventually sell.
Primary mortgage company will not refinance for many reasons: loan to value ratio, not my primary residence, make too much money for hardship (I am very lucky to still be working during this time.)
Renters still paying rent, however both are laid off now; I have approached them many times to buy, however they do not want to or cannot (especially now.)
What do I do with this? I cannot continue to dump money into this house and I do not have 16K to pay off the balloon.
I do not see a way out of this situation that does not end well for me and my tenants.
I know I should have been paying extra on the interest only loan, however the house has needed repairs and I cannot change it now.
Any advise and opinions are welcome.","Need Advise on RentalFirst Post....

t3_gjceq4,personalfinance,Is there a stock market for dummies?,"Okay. So I’ve made the decision even in the hard times we have right now to make some type of investment into the stock market. I’m no genius but I understand investing in companies that pay dividends to further invest the dividends paid out to keep generating passive income. I’ve currently only invested $200 so If I lose it I won’t have to jump out a window or anything (just kidding). My question is at what point do you stop investing the dividends paid out? Lets say best case scenario I get my portfolio to $30,000 in diversified stock over the next 5-10 years do I just keep reinvesting or do you take a large percentage of the paid dividends as profit and only reinvest a small portion? Honestly I don’t know enough about what I’m talking about yet but I haven’t found any suggestions on when to transfer money into your bank account from your portfolio.


EDIT: 
1. Yes I understand that dividends is not the only way to make money in stocks
2. I understand that 1-6% in dividends per stock is divided quarterly so the pay out could be .20 cents a share per quarter","Is there a stock market for dummies?Okay.

t3_gjcjay,personalfinance,Help me understand best mutual fund options,"I have an actively managed mutual fund that over the past 10 years has provided me a rate of return of 13.5%

This account now has 30k in it. I anticipate the next few years it will be hit as it tends to do poorly in times of recession. My other hesitation is that the exchange rate is 0.007 

I have an additional 15k now I want to put lump sum in a mutual fund. 
I am thinking I will do VTSAX with Vanguard as I love the 0.0004 exchange rate. Also i anticipate this fund will not take as hard of hit and feels like less of a risk. 


Is it dumb to not put more in my original actively managed fund with a different institution than Vanguard? I guess what I am asking is it dumb to not load up on 1 fund for a greater balance or is it ok to diversify even amongst broad mutual funds?

Moving forward, I have 401k employer matched maxed. 2019 Roth maxed. 

I anticipate I will add roughly 500 month to VTSAX and 250 to actively managed fund. 

No major expenses anticipated in next 5 years and have a 12 month safety net in HYSA.

t3_gjc904,personalfinance,Misfiled F2555 with late taxes,"Hello everyone,

So I think I really messed up on filling my back taxes. 

I filled on time for 2015, my first year partially in Japan, as I had some income from part time jobs That I worked in the US. However, I didn’t end up owing anything thanks to claiming the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, and that US income not being too much. 


After that, since I had no US income, and I thought my income would effectively be zero due to the FEIE, I didn’t file for three years. 

 Recently, with COVID 19 and stimulus checks, I decided to look into the laws, and realized that even with the FEIE, I obviously still need to file every year.

I panicked and filed out and mailed all three of my late years returns by paper, including the FEIE in each. What I didn’t however do was write the statement “Filed Pursuant to Section 1.911-7(a)(2)(i)(D)” on any of them. I didn’t realize it was necessary at the time because the wording of this [webpage](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/choosing-the-foreign-earned-income-exclusion) for the F2555 made it seem like that was only necessary if I would owe taxes, and I don’t earn too much (~36-37k usd at most per year).

My question is, is there anything I can do to amend that error? Or is there any way that I could still keep the FEIE despite that small and very possibly critical error?

Sorry for the rant, I’m extra stressed with the current situation, as I’m sure you all are too, in addition to my current predicament. And being in limbo due to paper returns not being processes is not helping. 

P.S. if anyone who has made the same mistake has any advice, that would also be greatly welcome.","Misfiled F2555 with late taxesHello everyone,

t3_gjc4my,personalfinance,My College Just Gave Me a Check and I Don't Know What to think of It,"Hi, so I'm lost.

My college which is a small private school just gave out checks to the students that attend the school and from talking to my friends it sounds like its a needs-based amount check. (the amount has ranged from $100-1000 depending on the person.) Also, this is different from the school reimbursement of housing, etc because that happened earlier in the year.

Anyway, from what I can gather, I think it is coming from a grant that my school got from the CARES Act because the check is in the name of my college.

If anyone is knowledgeable in the CARES Act and college money is there restrictions on my use of the money? It came with a note from my school saying it's for added expenses due to not being on campus such as rent, food, technology, child care, and health care. Does this mean that I can't use the check for tuition next fall (my current plan) how would my school track how I spend the money (since it came from my school NOT the government.)

t3_gjc1i9,personalfinance,Help with toll violation sent to collections?,"Not sure of the best way to handle this specific situation.

I received a ""Notice of Assignment to a Collection Agency"" letter for a toll violation. The notice date is Apr 24 and the issue date is Jan 7. This is the first time that I am hearing about the toll violation. The toll authority website says a picture is typically sent in the mail, but I did not receive anything from them. The name and license plate they listed is correct, but the notice did not have my apt number on it, so I am wondering what happened to the other mail if it was sent. The letter says their acct management is in another state and no one has answered the phone.

Even though it is only $26, I don't want this to affect my credit because I have worked hard to get it up to 700. At the same time, I don't want this to turn into a bigger issue. I am just not sure whether a pay to delete or goodwill letter would be better, since I have also read conflicting info online on how to go about either of those. If it makes any difference for writing a letter, this was also a one time occurrence. I had just moved to a new area and took a turn one too early trying to get to campus on the first day of class.

t3_gj9jms,personalfinance,Now able to save a decent amount of money and would like advice how to balance cash vs. investment vs. retirement,"Hey all - here's some info about my sitaution:

I'm 27, single, and live in California. I got a hefty raise before this whole coronavirus thing - it was initially delayed, but is now effective as of May 1st.

My main long-term goal is to buy a house (still a long way off from that though). In the short-term, I will probably need to buy a new (used) car in the next 2-3 years as my current car is getting pretty old (2007). Mainly i just want to save and travel a little bit.

I also may be starting small side business which would require 2-3k in start up costs, but wouldn't really require much more cash beyond that.

Salary: $73,000

401k Contribution: 3% (no employer match, but they offer a safe harbor contribution of 3% of salary which i'm eligible for starting September)

IRA Contribution: I only contributed $200 last year, but would like some advice on 2020

Net Pay after tax, 401k, health insurance: $4,138/month (or) $49,656/year

My monthly expenses are roughly $2,000/month, but in an emergency situation, I could probably get it down to about $1,700 - maybe less if I absolutely had to

I owe about $1k on my car @ 6% interest, which should be paid off in the next 4/5 months. Other than that, I don't have any debt.

Currently my money is split:

1. Cash (checking/saving) - $12,100
2. Investment Account - $3,500
3. Retirement (401k/IRAs) - $8,100

Total = $23,700

What are your thoughts on that moving forward? I'm in a position to start saving a decent amount of money every month, but I want to be conscious of staying somewhat liquid to buy a car at some point and possibly start that side business. And even though it's a long way off, I also want to be able to buy a house at some point. I think you can only pull $10,000 from your IRA for that without getting penalized, which in California is basically nothing for the down payment.

Would love to hear your guys' thoughts on this!","Now able to save a decent amount of money and would like advice how to balance cash vs. investment vs. retirementHey all - here's some info about my sitaution:

t3_gjbxid,personalfinance,Using extended repayment plans and avalanche method to pay less over life of student loans?,"I graduated in December 2018 and currently have about 44k in student loans. I have 8 loans with interest rates ranging from about 3.85% - 5.1%. I’m currently on the standard repayment plan, and my payments are about $450/mo, which we can afford, but I’m considering different repayment options to try to take advantage of the different interest rates to pay less over the life of the loans. This would basically involve switching to either the Extended Fixed (EF) or Extended Graduated (EG) Repayment Plan, which would increase the term of the loans from 10 years to 25 years and decrease my minimum monthly payments. Under EF my payment would be reduced to $227/mo and under EG my payments would start at $151/mo and ramp up to $392/mo.


I would make the minimum payments on all of the loans, except for the one with the highest interest rate. I would apply any money saved from my payment reduction (and maybe apply an extra $50 - $100 each month) to pay off the highest interest loan first and then avalanche that money into the next highest interest rate loan and so on. I know that I need to check with my loan servicer first to find out if additional money over the payment amount can be applied to the principle. If this isn’t the case, then I will use either a savings account or a money market account to save up and pay off the loan once I have enough.


Is there some reason why I shouldn’t do this though? Are there hidden fees with switching payment plans? Are there other disadvantages to doing this that I may not be considering?

t3_gjbsuz,personalfinance,To Buy a New Fuel Efficient Car or Not?,"I would like some input on if I should buy a new fuel efficient car or not. I have posted the math in a Google Docs Spreadsheet below. This is a quick back of napkin type calculation so its nowhere near perfect.

Some background info:

I just started a new job that requires me to drive a total of 90 miles per day. I currently drive a 2001 Nissan Frontier. It currently does not have working AC. (I live in the southeast US so it gets toasty during summer). I have been mulling over the idea of getting a new, more fuel efficient car that has all the bells and whistles to make my commute more enjoyable. The 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited Hybrid was the car I was looking at based on reviews and having friends who like their Sonatas. I assumed no car loan interest and maintenance/insurance/registrations would be equal. From my math (please tell me if I am wrong) it would take almost 5.5 years to break even on the difference to do some maintenance and fix my AC on my Frontier vs buying the Sonata.

Spreadsheet Number Breakdown:

Miles/Day: how many miles I drive to and from work

Gas Price/Gallon: current gas prices in my area

Upfront Cost: cost to fix some things on the Frontier and price of the Sonata

MPG: average miles per gallon taken from the US Department of Energy website

Cost/Day: ((Miles/Day) / (MPG)) \* (Gas Price/Gallon)

t3_gjb5oh,personalfinance,Father pressing me to buy my stock options.. not sure if best decision.,"Hi all, 

First of all I want to thank you all for existing. You've been a major step forward for me in my finances!

Ok, now here's the issue I'm facing. My father is pressing me to purchase my startup stock options. 

He believes the company might be being sold. I won't give too much detail on the company, but they have basically gotten consistent investment for years and are still pre-profit. 

In my opinion, maybe out of kool-aid drinking. I believe the company has the potential to succeed, and do truly believe in it becoming one of the larger market share holders. 

BUT we're still pre-profit &amp; from my understanding pre-proof of concept, and in my mind, no where near being bought out. (Which is what my father seems to think will happen soon)

There are investors checking us out, which I have not witnessed before. However, I assume we're just getting more investors. Not so much being bought. 

I will be maxing out my Roth IRA soon, and will have some extra money to invest.

1. Is my dad right about putting my eggs in my company? 

2.Will acquiring another investor decrease the value of my stock options?

3. Or am I right to think I can invest down the line where 'proof of business' and profit have been accomplished?

I know that I might be missing information for you to be able to provide an informed decision... but I'm not quite sure what that my be so please ask me, and I will answer.","Father pressing me to buy my stock options.. not sure if best decision.Hi all,

t3_gjblf9,personalfinance,How much house can I really afford?,"All the affordability calculators are giving me numbers that seem absurdly high, so I’m hoping to get a more realistic opinion.

* **Debt**: None.  I currently don’t have a car payment, but for this I’d like to assume I’ll have one of, say $400/mo.

I do have a couple of hobbies that aren’t super apartment/condo/townhome friendly, but I’m not sold on that being a good enough reason by itself to buy a house.

t3_gjbhte,personalfinance,Is moving to a new city with only 7-8K saved a feasible achievement?,"So here's my situation.

I'm miserable. I live in a city that I have no connections in with no friends and nothing to do because it's in the middle of bumfck nowhere. I'm only here because I graduated college last year and had to move back in with my parents.  Since around last fall, I've been saving up by working minimum wage jobs, and have now around 6.5K in savings. I'm looking to make that 8K come july.

I want to move desperately. I'm 23 and want to experience life in a place where there are things to do and people my age to hang out with and find an SO to build a life with. But I just feel like that's impossible to do because I am unable to get work experience in any field besides minimum wage because of where I live, and because now we have this Covid Crisis going on. I'm planning to wait out until July, but once I have that 8k I plan to book it somewhere else.

My plan is to get a cheap air n b place for 1 month, and look for a roomshare situation on craigslist as well as some jobs while staying there. I'm looking to move to a city that has a large workforce market so that I can apply for things that aren't retail. The only debt I have is a car payment that is around 300$ a month, which my parents have offered to cover for me until I land on my feet.

But I'm scared to make the jump. Both because I don't know when the country will open back up, and because I've been told moving without a job lined up is generally an awful idea.

The other problem, however, is that my parents have told me there is a possibility they will be moving overseas this fall anyway, which means I might be forced into this situation anyway.

The two main cities I'm looking at at the moment are cities in the Valley of California, Wake County in North Carolina, and the suburbs of Chicago. I have family I can stay with in NC and Chicago Suburbs, but Sacramento is my top choice.","Is moving to a new city with only 7-8K saved a feasible achievement?So here's my situation.

Loan 2: owing 2820 @36.9 interest
Credit card 1: owing 2800ish @29.9 Interest 
Credit card 2: owing 949 @21.9 interest 

It seems and has been near by impossible to get out of this difficult time..

I have a 9 month old daughter and I’m trying really hard to make the right choices..

I called my bank about debt consolidation and was rejected based on my high 400 credit score..

I’ve talked to an advisor and I’m still totally unsure what to do...

I’ve considered taking out a bigger loan that would clear out all those debts previously mentioned.

I’ve also been told maybe I should do a consumer proposal which in sense makes me credit worse before it gets better meaning I don’t pay those companies it’s full cost just most of it, but I want everything gone without credit getting worse...

If I can get any time of advice that would be greatly appreciated.


Edited with updated info.

I currently do not have any “emergency savings” or investments to which I tried to get into before but the lack of cash flow I had (based on all the interest) I didn’t have much or much extra to put towards that...

In a month on average I will get 2800/month... after monthly expenses I would have about 1200 left.. but after making constant payments towards loans and credit cards there’s not much to show.","I have some debt issues and could really use a point in the right direction.Need some advice.

t3_gjbb61,personalfinance,No record of mailed tax return after eight weeks. Can I e-file instead?,"I am due for a decent tax refund this year. I physically mailed in my tax return on March 20th to the local branch of the treasury department using the address and labeling info provided by TurboTax. I chose not to e-file at the time because I did not have all of the requisite information, namely my 2018 tax return, which I now have access to. 

I have physically mailed in previous tax returns and, until this year, have received my refund promptly. The fact that my return was not returned to sender would seem to indicate that the USPS was able to successfully deliver the return, so there should not have been any issues with the address or postage. 

The IRS states that I should wait 6-8 weeks before the refund posts to my account. This is now the end of week 8. The ""Get Refund Status"" page on IRS.gov still seems to indicate that they have not received my request for my refund. I mailed the return again about three weeks later after I mailed the first one just be sure. Again, no change on the website. I understand that it may take some time for the refund to post to my bank account but I would at least expect the ""Get Refund Status"" page to show that they have a record of receiving the return by this point in time. 

I have not received any written correspondence from the IRS so it doesn't seem like there should be anything holding up the return (e.g. an audit). 

Everyone I know who chose to e-file received their refunds promptly after filing.  So I guess my questions are:

- Is there some sort of delay in processing tax returns, specifically physical tax returns, that I'm not aware of?
- Is there an option for me to somehow ""cancel"" my mailed-in refund request and instead choose to e-file?
- Will e-filing my tax return screw things up later? I don't want to e-file unless I'm certain that the mailed-in tax won't mess things up down the line.

t3_gjb7wv,personalfinance,Sell old house or rent? Are we crazy?,"Hi PF - throwaway here. 

Right before the pandemic, my wife and I bought another house that fit our needs better, and moved. Our old house is paid off - so we were able to take our time in moving. Right now it’s just sitting there, because we have a few things left to fix and haven’t been able to get over there easily. 

We could rent out the old house for \~$2000 (takehome $1500 after prop taxes and saving for repairs). 

But we really want to sell the house and take home about 300k. 

We both own our own companies and are freelancers in the live event/concert business, and work a lot with schools.

Because of COVID, we’ve lost all income for Q2, Q3 and possibly Q4.  
(Gov assistance is helping some)

We’re surviving mainly on business cash savings.

We do not want to take that $300k and put it on the new house because it wouldn’t cover all the new mortgage entirely, and we would still have a payment anyway each month.  

\-zero debt (aside from new house mortgage)  
\-$1500 a month mortgage on new house @ 4%  
\-including mortgage, about $5k/month expenses  
\-no kids (no plan for kids in the future)  
\-been living off of business cash savings reserves  
\-have 401k and 6 month emergency fund that we haven’t touched yet. 

So:

1. Are we crazy for wanting to sell the old house (instead of renting)?
2. Are we crazy to want to put most of the cash into a longterm managed investment account? (Instead of pay down new house)

The idea with investing is this:  
We did a managed account with Vanguard last year. We put in $100k, in Jan 2019 made $14k in 11 months, and used that $114k to put a downpayment on our new house.

Let’s say we sell the old house and take home $300k.    
I would want to put $200k in Vanguard and the remaining $100k would    
So, even if we only make 8% return in Vanguard, I feel like it’s an easier way to have cash quickly (even though it would be taxed) if we HAVE to pull it out for living expenses down the road. And if we don’t have to touch it, then it grows.  

I REALLY like the idea of renting for residual income, but maybe with our jobs and in the current climate, it might be better to have a lump sum of cash.  
Also - with our jobs, we would HAVE to hire a management company. When we’re on shows, we’re unavailable to repair things or even talk with someone about a dishwasher not working. 

Open to your thoughts or questions!","Sell old house or rent? Are we crazy?Hi PF - throwaway here.

We did a managed account with Vanguard last year. We put in $100k, in Jan 2019 made $14k in 11 months, and used that $114k to put a downpayment on our new house.

Let’s say we sell the old house and take home $300k.    
I would want to put $200k in Vanguard and the remaining $100k would    
So, even if we only make 8% return in Vanguard, I feel like it’s an easier way to have cash quickly (even though it would be taxed) if we HAVE to pull it out for living expenses down the road. And if we don’t have to touch it, then it grows.  

I REALLY like the idea of renting for residual income, but maybe with our jobs and in the current climate, it might be better to have a lump sum of cash.  
Also - with our jobs, we would HAVE to hire a management company. When we’re on shows, we’re unavailable to repair things or even talk with someone about a dishwasher not working.

So in my current situation that money can remain untouched no problem. 


But, after covid winds down I’m planning on getting employed asap, and moving out with room mates, I’m scared I’ll eat through my savings doing this though.

Rent in this area can vary from around $450-1000 a month depending on location and roommates,
 if that matters at all.

With offices being closed, I (22M) have moved back home with my family during COVID to get out of the city. 

During this extended time at home, I am realizing that my parents are in rough financial shape (lawsuits from creditors, foreclosure, behind on taxes, etc.) and are in, what I am assuming to be, a large amount of debt. 

I explained the possibility of forbearance on their mortgage due to COVID, but they were behind on their obligations prior to COVID and forbearance has not been offered. 

I have money saved up that I can offer to help, but I’d rather get them professional assistance as it could have a lasting impact on their financial situation, as opposed to temporary relief if I were to pay a small portion of their balance for breathing room. 

Are there any programs available that would help them with their debt? I’ve seen mixed reviews about debt relief programs, and working with lawyers could be costly. Any input you all have would be greatly appreciated.

t3_gjb03l,personalfinance,Can I afford 2.2k rent? Is there too much opportunity cost?,"You guessed it, this is in SF/Bay Area, CA.

I am 24 and I currently make 130k a year or 160k after bonus. I have been living in a shared house paying $1,600 in rent but I am getting kicked out in the next couple months because the owners want to move back into their home. This is unfortunate but I feel like I might be in a good enough place financially to finally rent my own apartment. I'm also looking forward to having my own place as I have had roommates since I was 17 years old in college. Even more unfortunate is that I live in Bay Area where rent is ridiculous. I am looking at studios for $2-2.2k. So after utilities I could be paying let's say $2,300 for living expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Some details:  
Currently have a 6 month emergency fund sitting in a high interest savings account  
About 30k invested in retirement across 401k and Roth IRA (have to do backdoor this year).  
10k Car Note @ 2.99% interest  
I contribute 6% to my 401k to get the matching and max out my Roth IRA. I was planning on increasing to about 10%  
No major expenses coming up that I wouldn't be able to cover with cash or plans for further education

&amp;#x200B;

Budget outside of living expenses:  
Net Monthly Income after 401k, Insurance, and maxing IRA is $6,000 (before bonus. bonus is additional unbudgeted money for me)  
Transportation: $500 a month ($270 car payment, $100 insurance, $130 gas)  
Food: $300 a month  
Misc: $500 a month (clothes, skincare, entertainment, subscriptions, treating family/friends out)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a retirement model built out and my soft goal is to retire by 46. I did the math and if I were to save that additional $700 a month I would spend on rent for 3 years in the market, with 7% compounding interest it would be \~100k when I turn 46 (someone check my math), which I guess would shave a lot of time towards that goal, however how long am I supposed to keep living in a house with strangers where I feel uncomfortable bringing guests and partners over? Until I'm 27? 30? I really don't enjoy that outlook.

Additionally, I've sort of given up on a owning a home in Bay Area as in most places, even a townhome, costs $1 mill.

t3_gjar1j,personalfinance,The last beast to conquer in getting my credit in order... a tuition bill in collections,"Hello, hope everyone is safe. Thanks in advance for reading or engaging! Long story to ask a simple question related to collections agencies so anyone with experience or knowledge with this let me know what you’ve dealt with or any advice. 

In the last 2 years I’ve had a reliable and good paying job. Now I’m ready to buy a home but I need to bring my credit up. I paid small medical bills I had let go in to collections (I don’t know some times these things just happen in your young adulthood). 

But now I have to pay the tuition from my last semester at a university when I dropped out without making any payments. 2 years ago I made payments to a collection agency so the school would release my transcript to my new school, but I never finished paying. 

So presently there is a new collection agency handling this. First call to them at the end of April they say they can submit a settlement offer to the school but it needs to be 75-80% of the amount. I can’t do that amount, and no time to do payment plans because I need to move ASAP.

I call them today to see if they will do a lower offer than that threshold. I offer pretty low like 30% just to start. The guy says typically 50% is where the settlement offer starts. That sounds pretty good but before I can even engage with the guy the line starts breaking up terribly and this guy transfers me.

 Now new guy says 70-80% is the lowest offer he will send to the school. I argue with him for a while for him to just send a lower offer. He won’t budge at about 62%. I tell him the other guy said 50% and he says he will have to review the call. 

So specifically, what is the reason why they can’t just send a low ball offer? It’s up to the school to decide if they will accept the amount so why can’t they just send any number I say? And also, how can I know what the true lower limit for sending an offer is? I want them to admit it could be as low as 50% so can I get them to send me the transcript from that conversation?","The last beast to conquer in getting my credit in order... a tuition bill in collectionsHello, hope everyone is safe.

t3_gjapk6,personalfinance,Bank closed my card w/o notice,"Hello, I am a student who's trying to use this stay at home time trying to get his finances in order as best as possible especially after I had someone try to use one of my CC recently w/o my knowledge. I was hoping to get some advice here because I am still learning about finance on my own. 

I have been with 5/3 as my main bank for over a decade and basically have just used a checking account there. It was my first bank and the closest one to my house. So no problems really, but I did get a recent alert through my credit monitoring app that I had closed my 5/3 credit card (cc) account last week. Problem is I did not cancel my 5/3 credit card, I called 5/3 and they did it last week without alerting me (0$ balance on it). I was quite surprised since none of my 5/3 cards expire until 2021 so I dont know why they just chose to do it out of the blue. I am not the best at accounting, so I checked my transunion credit report and things seem fine so I am also asking here.

Also I saw my credit score dip 28 pts (pictured below) and on creditwise it was 48 pts lower in a day https://imgur.com/a/B6VNg8n


Questions:

A) If a bank closes one of your accounts with or without your knowledge can your credit score fall like 48 points in a day? How does this even work?

B) 5/3 asked me if I wanted to reopen the credit card (which I dont use), will this help raise my score back up?

C) What are some tips to raise my credit score back up since I've always tried to be careful with every dollar I spend. I have about $2500 balance on a 0% APR AMEX card and $5000 balance 8% APR on a capital one card I've had for over 10 years. Should I dip into my checking account (wanted to keep a balance here in case of emergency during these times) to pay these down?

D) I've been with 5/3 for a long time but I just felt the communication hasn't been that great from them and can't even recall ever getting alerts through mail, phone, or their online portal. What is the safest way to change my bank which includes 2 checking accounts, a savings account, since I have never worked with any other bank before?

E) Any easy to read materials for a novice who doesnt know much about finance to learn?


Apologies if this is incoherent, I am not very good with numbers, so I am still on the phones with my different accounts and banks to try to find out what is going on. Thanks for any assistance, I will follow along with this thread while I am crunching all the numbers throughout the night.","Bank closed my card w/o noticeHello, I am a student who's trying to use this stay at home time trying to get his finances in order as best as possible especially after I had someone try to use one of my CC recently w/o my knowledge. I was hoping to get some advice here because I am still learning about finance on my own. 

I have been with 5/3 as my main bank for over a decade and basically have just used a checking account there. It was my first bank and the closest one to my house. So no problems really, but I did get a recent alert through my credit monitoring app that I had closed my 5/3 credit card (cc) account last week. Problem is I did not cancel my 5/3 credit card, I called 5/3 and they did it last week without alerting me (0$ balance on it). I was quite surprised since none of my 5/3 cards expire until 2021 so I dont know why they just chose to do it out of the blue. I am not the best at accounting, so I checked my transunion credit report and things seem fine so I am also asking here.

Also I saw my credit score dip 28 pts (pictured below) and on creditwise it was 48 pts lower in a day https://imgur.com/a/B6VNg8n


Questions:

A) If a bank closes one of your accounts with or without your knowledge can your credit score fall like 48 points in a day? How does this even work?

B) 5/3 asked me if I wanted to reopen the credit card (which I dont use), will this help raise my score back up?

C) What are some tips to raise my credit score back up since I've always tried to be careful with every dollar I spend. I have about $2500 balance on a 0% APR AMEX card and $5000 balance 8% APR on a capital one card I've had for over 10 years.

t3_gjanpn,personalfinance,My dad wants to withdraw his 401k and would like some assistance with that.,"So pretty much, he wants to withdraw his 401k retirement savings because he is afraid that there will be another wave of the virus and the market will be impacted again. He is currently 1.5 years away from retirement and he can already withdraw his saving without a penalty other than a federal tax. Personally, I suggested to keep it there until he retires. My view is that the economy will get better by that time. I also suggested, if he wants to go ahead and take out, I could make a savings account with my credit union from work which pays 1.5-2% dividends. What do you guys think? any suggestions are welcome. 

Also, he called the company where he confirmed that he wouldn't have any penalties for taking out, and asked if he would still have to report it to the IRS during the tax season and they told him they didn't know and only the tax preparer would let him know. do you guys know if he still has to report if he takes out and if that will affect him? 

What is usually the difference between taking out at 60 vs 62. I know I've heard before it's optimal to take out at 62. 

Thank you for the help!

EDIT: thanks guys! I figured taking out right now would not be convenient  and which I tried to tell my dad. I am currently looking into trying to change those investments to a more stable portfolio. We are both not too clear how the process of taking out works when ready to retire so I want him to make an informed decision.","My dad wants to withdraw his 401k and would like some assistance with that.So pretty much, he wants to withdraw his 401k retirement savings because he is afraid that there will be another wave of the virus and the market will be impacted again.

t3_gjaj8k,personalfinance,Student loan repayment strategy question,"Hi, r/personalfinance. I have a (potentially dumb) question regarding loan repayment strategies. I have a significant amount of student loan debt that I'm pretty sure I'll be able to handle just fine (job starting in the fall, thankfully), but I want to make sure I pay it all off optimally. I looked at the PF wiki for loan repayment, which only mentioned the avalanche and snowball methods. I get that the snowball method might be helpful for some people, but I think the avalanche method will work best for me--that is, at least in principle.

For some background: I have several loan ""groups"" varying in interest rates (\~3.5–7.8%) and in ""current payoff"" balances (\~$3k–23k). The avalanche method is described in the wiki as ""paying off the highest interest loans first.""

I am wondering if the avalanche method means that I should still direct all my payments toward the loans with the highest interests, even if their current payoff balances (which I gather are the principals + already-accrued interest) are lower than other loans. To make things more concrete, would it make more sense to pay off Loan A with a $26k balance at 6% or Loan B with a $17k balance at 7%? Obviously, Loan A will accrue more interest over the next year or so than Loan B, which makes me question whether the avalanche method's directive is universally applicable.

I'm guessing that it (at least) partially depends on the time it would take for me to pay off the loans  and go on to the next ones, so is there a way for me to make this kind of calculation based on my income/the portion of my income that I'm confident I'll be able to direct toward my student loans? I haven't been able to find any kind of online calculator that is capable of going into such specific details—if there is one out there that I missed, a link would be deeply appreciated.

Thanks in advance for the advice--this subreddit has already been really helpful as I've planned my personal finances.","Student loan repayment strategy questionHi, r/personalfinance.

t3_gjaita,personalfinance,Pay off debt\save?,"This is my first post on reddit. Received a lot of great information on this forum. So I wanted to check what is the best strategy for my current situation. I am looking for what could be the upside of saving vs clearing the debt.

My situation  
Car loan pending $5k (at 2.5% interest)  
Consumer loan pending $5k (at 0% interest, just minimum payments for next 3 years)

We bought a house last year at 10% down. Me and my wife combined have \~6 months worth of emergency fund. We both work and lucky to still have our jobs during this pandemic.

Coming to the question, I got hooked to paying off debt. it was \~50k(my own) two years back. I feel like paying off these debts. But I also want to save and have extra cushion in case if I loose job.

I am basically leaning towards paying off the $10k(at $1000/month). But also fear if 6 month saving is enough in this situation.

t3_gja5ne,personalfinance,Advice on whether home ownership is feasible.,"My spouse and I live in a very expensive metropolitan area in the US — one of the top three or four nationally. Our combined annual base income is about $150k before taxes. However, my total gross income can fluctuate upward wildly. Like, last year I made $300k. The year before that I made about $200k. (The fluctuation is due to bonuses I get from my job — my base salary without bonuses is $100k). 

By the end of this year my spouse and I will have saved about $300k to purchase a home. It’ll be our first home. We’ve always rented till now. But in this area, the types of houses we are interested in owning range from $900,000 on the low end to like $2 million on the (reasonable) upper end. The houses we most like and would be willing to live in are typically about $1.25 million. 

Obviously we can’t afford a $2 million dollar home. That’s not my question. My question is — from everything described above, is home ownership in this market a realistic possibility for us? Are we just out of league, need to accept that, and either rent for the rest of our lives or move to a cheaper area (i.e. the suburbs)? Or, assuming we are absolutely unwilling to move to a cheaper market, do we need to keep saving until we have $400-$600k in order to afford houses in this area? Which I guess we could do.

t3_gja3uq,personalfinance,Shopping for a new home and lender sent me this “price sheet” today. Does this sound right?,"I’m new to the home buying game and looking to buy my first house. I have a realtor and have been shopping around for lenders.

I had one send me a “fee sheet” today outlining everything that I’d be looking at in order to actually get the keys to the house. It surprised me that it was so high. 

I haven’t talked to him yet (he just emailed me the fee sheet) but I wanted to go in to the conversation with some general knowledge first.

My understanding is the “loan discount fee” is the same as buying down my interest. So basically I’m paying $3k upfront to have a lower interest rate? The rate I was quoted for interest today is 3.25%. This is an estimate for an approx $320k home. I live in CA if it matters

So a little over $12k in addition to the down payment. I did not expect that much. This is an estimate from him on a $320k house.

t3_gja2vp,personalfinance,Mortgage Refi - Worth it?,"Not getting much in the way of guidance from the potential lender so I figured I'd ask the experts:

Looking to refi current 30 year mortgage @ 4.125%. Paid biweekly for several years and have 18.5 years left on the mortgage.

Thinking of rolling closing costs in and only paying lender fee and appraisal out of pocket (\~$1,000). I've been having some challenges with the math and if this is a good idea or not - seems like the savings might be around $20,000 or so if I take closing costs (initial and refi) out of the potential interest savings. Numbers are as follows:

* Initial Mortgage - $155,000 @ 4.125%
* Current balance - $126,400 with 18.5 years remaining
* Potential refi with closing costs rolled in - $131,000 @ 2.625%

t3_gj9icl,personalfinance,"Home Warranty for Homebuyer? Sudden Veterans Discount at Last Minute, But Must Be Used as Part of Transaction","Hey all, so I'm in contract to buy a house in Portland, OR on a 0% down VA loan. I do final walkthrough tonight, sign closing documents Friday, and record on Monday. I just got a call from my agent letting me know that the escrow company is offering a veteran's discount for about $375, but it has to be applied to the transaction. It's too late to modify the loan, and the seller is paying closing costs as part of the transaction, so I'm told that my only option at this point is to leave the money on the table or buy a home warranty. Normally I'd steer clear of home warranties, but since it's free money I figured I'd get a second opinion from Reddit.

My wife shopped around and found a couple of the apparently few reputable warranty providers out there, and currently we're considering the ""platinum"" plan from AFC Home Club, which costs $450/year (so we'd be about $75 out of pocket on the transaction), has a $125 service charge/copay, and let's you choose your own contractor to do work as long as they're licensed and bonded. They also ""guarantee"" their repairs as long as you retain coverage. Seems like a decent deal just in case anything comes out of left field in the first year. 

The home is overall in pretty good shape, with the only big imminent issue is the HVAC system that's 20-25 years old and using R22, so likely on its last legs and expensive to keep limping along. (Edit: Looking through their coverage it looks like repairs to and upgrading from an R22 system isn't covered) I've got a healthy emergency savings and a stable job amidst all of the economic turmoil (or else I wouldn't even be buying this house), so if the HVAC or anything else goes I could feel comfortable dealing with it. I'm leaning toward going for it, but I also recognize that warranties are almost always a waste of money so I want to make sure I don't have stars in my eyes.

My parents bought a timeshare from Westgate about 20 years ago. Apparently up until a year or two ago they have been paying on it. My father passed away a while back and my mother has come to a point where my sister and I have had to move home to help take care of her and the house. We have gotten calls from Westgate (supposedly) for about a year now but they will not talk to me, only my father or mother. I explain that my father passed and that my mother doesn't communicate well but they still won't tell me anything. We recently got a phone that blocks spam calls so we haven't had calls from them for a while. Well this letter showed up and now I realize why they were calling. As far as I can tell from looking at bank statements this timeshare hasn't had its upkeep cost paid for a year or more. 

My question is where should I go from here? I'm not necessarily trying to get out of paying this, I just want to know what is the best way for me to proceed to address this letter and, eventually, get this timeshare off her (and our) backs. Any help would be appreciated.","Elderly mother received debt collector notice, need advice.https://imgur.com/a/pyKR8d9

I am a full time college student and the only income I have is from my student research which was $3500 in 2019. I have never filed my taxes before since my parents always sent it through their accountant. I told my parents I would like to start filing on my own so I can better understand how to do my own taxes since I won't likely use an accountant out of school. My dad gave me all my tax papers that came to the house. He has told me multiple times that I don't even need to file. I watched the khan academy course on taxes and personal finance as well as did some poking around on the IRS website. After doing that I thought maybe I should file my taxes. Am I wrong? My understanding is that since I made $3500 and I am claimed as a dependent, my standard deduction is $1100 and I pay in the 10% bracket on the rest. For clarification, my research money was a stipend so I filled out a W9 and recieved a 1099-MISC at the end of the year. Am I going about this the right way or am I wasting my time and money?

Also, I'm not sure how to deal with the tuition form I got. My parents have been helping me with tuition so I'm not sure how to report that.

Back in the 1950's my grandma bought a house. I believe she owned the house. She lived in it until 2001, when my mom and I moved in. My mom currently lives there. This year, I would like to buy the house from my mom so she can move in with her boyfriend and retire.

I don't know why it was recorded as $1, but now I'm very concerned that my mom will be taxed unnecessarily for this sale, when that $1 figure does not represent the value of the house at the time of sale. My mom currently has a $200K mortgage on it, which she took out in 2016.

t3_gj80xh,personalfinance,401k to ROTH IRA Rollover - Laid off edition,"Hi Finance Gurus on Reddit!

I need your advice. I was recently laid off from my employer in late FEB 2020 from ole 'Rona, and I will not return to the same employer. When the market was in a down spiral, I also moved 100% of my 401k mutual fund investments to Money Market account to not lose more % of my total portfolio (I know...I know...rookie mistake, but whats done is now done....Lesson learned) and my overall portfolio went from $150k to $100k :(

I am 29 and believe to rollover my company sponsored 401k to a ROTH IRA would be in my best interest. I figure with 40ish years left until retirement, a ROTH conversion now makes the most sense - i bite the bullet and pay taxes now on $100k, and be able to withdraw the rewards of compound interest 40 years from now tax free in its totality.

Here is my logic and please let me know where this doesnt make sense:

1. I understand that I will owe Federal and State Income Taxes on that $100k - but if there is a brightside to my story, I now dont have to pay taxes on $150k hahaha
2. I forsee the majority of this year job hunting and free-lancing work so WITHOUT the $100k I expect to be in the lowest tax bracket for 2020 single filers - 10% (less than $9,875 annual income)
3. I know that I can split the rollover into X% per year to allow me to stay in a lower tax bracket. So for example, 2020's 12% Tax bracket is $9,876 to $40,125. So if I rolled over, say 33%, I would only owe 12% of $33k rather than 24% of $100k. In this example, I am taking three years to roll it all over, paying $12,030 total in federal taxes over 3 years  vs $19,200 for taxes owed this year.
4. Using the previous example, I understand that would I lose the magic compound interest if I break up the rollover into 3 years. If I go ahead and transfer the full $100k, by the end of that third year, I believe that $100k would be larger than rolling over $33k for three years, and be large enough to offset the tax differential.
5. Plus THIS year, I know what my federal tax bracket will be (10%) and I can plan accordingly. The next three years I will not know what my tax bracket will be.
6. I thought about rolling over $30k in Dec 2020 and then the other $70k in Jan 2021. That way, they hit different tax years AND I wont lose the compound interest opportunity because I will be with the full $100k within weeks of each other. 
7. As I mentioned, i am 100% in money market accounts. If I invest back into mutual funds and wait until Dec to rollover, my account will be (hopefully) larger, and I will owe more taxes than rolling over today.

So should I rollover now? Other plans/strategies I havent considered?

Sorry that was so long, but thanks for sticking with me thru it!! I appreciate any the advice!!","401k to ROTH IRA Rollover - Laid off editionHi Finance Gurus on Reddit!

t3_gj73my,personalfinance,Is now a good time for a debt consolidation loan?,"Hey everyone!

t3_gj7v5r,personalfinance,I need some help regarding my job furlough/lay-off and some finicky text on the unemployment benefits page.,"**Disclaimer: I'm aware that PUA exists and I will use it before attempting to look for a new job, but for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend it doesn't exist for the issue I'm presenting below. Thank you.**

For context, I live in Oregon and (for obvious reasons) everyone in the restaurant I work for got a temporary leave. This was back in the middle of March. I filed a claim a week later and have received four weekly benefit payments since (with the extra $600 included). However, this brings my to my problem and question: 

It seems that maybe I've reached my limit on weekly unemployment benefits for furlough/lay-off? I've always clicked the checkmark next to this text (highlighted the important part in bold):

&gt; ""I am temporarily unemployed because I have been laid off or had my hours reduced and expect to return to work with my employer. I am returning to work that is full-time or work that pays more than my weekly benefit amount. **There are no more than four (4) weeks between the week I became temporarily unemployed and the week I am returning to work.** I have stayed in contact with my employer. I understand false answers may result in overpaid benefits and additional penalties I must pay back.""

So does this mean I have to actively look for a new job in order to continue to receive benefits? I thought so, but then I read this text on the same page:

&gt; ""You are actively seeking work if you will return to your employer or are willing to look for work when state and local emergency declarations related to the coronavirus expire or otherwise are no longer in effect.""

Does this text fall under the ""four weeks"" restriction that the first text mentioned? Or am I free to just continue filing claims and receiving payments for those claims as long as my job will still eventually re-open?

If not, then like I said before, I need to look for a new job then (again, as the disclaimer stated, after attempting PUA)? Thanks for any help.","I need some help regarding my job furlough/lay-off and some finicky text on the unemployment benefits page.**Disclaimer: I'm aware that PUA exists and I will use it before attempting to look for a new job, but for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend it doesn't exist for the issue I'm presenting below.

I have a 2015 Honda Civic LX about 75k miles. I purchased it in 2017 for about 11k. I’m moving to a city where I won’t really need my car and the apartment garage fees are expensive ($185 a month). I’m quite sure I’m going to leave it at my family’s house in the garage while I work for 2-3 years. 

My question is: should I sell my car or keep it?

If I keep my car, I will be paying about $600 a month for 24 months to get rid of my debt. I won’t be struggling and I will still have money for rent, spending, saving, etc. 

However, if I sale my car, for 7k-9k I could apply that directly to my debt and cut my debt in half. I could then greatly increase my savings ratio and pay the rest of my debt quicker and thus owe less on interest. My concern however is that if I decide to go to graduate school (currently that is the plan) and move then I will likely need a car. And then I’ll end up still needing to take from my savings to purchase a car (I would likely get a used Honda Civic again but a later model and stay in the 10-12k budget).

Currently my budget is:

~$4000 after tax

$1500 toward rent and utilities
$1000 in spending
$500 savings 
$600 in debt
$400 (this May go to savings or may go to health- considering getting braces again, etc.)

However if I sold my car I would lower my debt and increase savings substantially but con is I may have to repurchase car anyways in 2-3 years.

Thank you.

t3_gj7eb5,personalfinance,My bank LOWERED my auto rate!!!!,"Today I called my bank who does my car loan. 

Back story: when i got approved for my car loan, I had just switched job fields, so getting approved was not an easy task. I got approved in November 2018 for 7.4%.

In the last year, my credit score has gone up quite a bit and I feel like 7.4% is outrageous for my car loan.

So I called my bank today and asked them if they could look into refinancing my loan. She said they dont do existing customer refinances. But she said she would see if they could qualify me for a lower interest rate on my current loan.

She came back on the phone and offered me a 4.6% rate, no hard credit check needed, for a one time $50 processing fee that gets added on to the final payment of the loan, or final payoff, whichever comes first.

t3_gj784f,personalfinance,MBNA.ca Credit Card Fraud?,"I'm looking for advice/help, (for reference i live in canada/toronto).

I have an online credit card with a bank (mbna.ca) , some back story, I have had this card for 6 years and have never made a single purchase on it because I exclusively use it to hold debt at times due to their low interest rate.

About a little over a month ago I received a phone call from [infoprotector.ca](https://www.infoprotector.ca/), this company claim to be calling **on behalf of MBNA** and were offering a credit protection plan of some sort which I quickly denied. A few weeks later they sent me a physical mail pamphlet which i just threw out cause I was by no means interest in their service.

Surprise surprise 2 weeks later I got charged ($100) for this service that I never authorized, wanted nor gave my credit card info to. In fact like i said above I have never made any purchase with this credit card so the only explanation is that they somehow got the info from my bank, which makes sense since they literally said they were calling on behalf of MBNA.

I tried to contact MBNA about it and they quickly turn me down and asked me to contact infoprotect first. Turns out their phone number cant be called due to covid19 so I had to send them an email which two weeks later is still unanswered.

I went back to my bank to try and report their fraud but they once again said there is nothing they can do about it cause is a third party. After a lot of back and forth and getting transfer through every department, they ended up transferring me to the dispute department which I waited for one hour and they never pick up despite every other department picking up within 1 minute.

Is becoming quite clear to me that they aren't gonna help me and are defiantly in on the fraud, so I'm just wondering what are the best next steps for me take? also wondering if anyone else with this bank has had similar issues?

t3_gj74m9,personalfinance,"Is a Roth IRA really worth it? Penalties, complex regulations, etc.","I know I'm going to get downvotes for this since I'm going against the grain, I'm ready for them.

I am self employed. Personal finance wisdom seems to suggest that I use Roth IRA (USA) to save for retirement. I have done my research on Roth IRA's and I do not like what I have found so far.

- Subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty. I am young and I plan to FIRE. I do not want this money tied up for another 30 years. Maybe I FIRE, maybe I want to take a sabbatical, maybe I want to pay rent with investments for awhile, etc.
- Early withdrawal regulations for Roth IRA's are complex. I'll read articles that say things like ""Roth IRA withdrawals are penalty free"" and ""Roth IRA's incur a 10% withdrawal penalty"" and these contradictory phrases will be side by side in the same article.
- All this work to waive a 15% capital gains tax. Income tax is already paid. Doesn't seem like much benefit just to waive 15% capital gains tax.
- My brokerage bank, Ally, doesn't appear to have Roth IRA brokerage accounts. [Only CD and savings.](https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/ira-account/). So I would have to split into 2 brokerage accounts at different banks, which increases complexity. And the second bank would probably charge fees (Ally doesn't charge account fees or trade commissions for the type of trading I do)
- There are major limits on how much can be contributed per year. $6000 seems very low. I like having a minimum number of bank accounts (one checking, one brokerage) and just glancing at one dashboard. I don't really want to make multiple bank accounts at multiple banks just for $6000/yr.

It sounds like there's 3 scenarios that I can be put in:

- Roth IRA, no early withdrawal - I don't withdrawal my money for 30 years and I get 0% capital gains tax
- Roth IRA, early withdrawal - I withdrawal my money early and have to pay 15% capital gains tax + 10% withdrawal penalty = 25%.
- Taxable Account- I keep my single brokerage account (simplicity), and my freedom to withdrawal whenever I want, and just pay a flat 15% no matter when I withdraw.

Alright Reddit, now's your chance. Am I crazy? Explain to me the error of my ways. r/ChangeMyView","Is a Roth IRA really worth it? Penalties, complex regulations, etc.I know I'm going to get downvotes for this since I'm going against the grain, I'm ready for them.

I am self employed. Personal finance wisdom seems to suggest that I use Roth IRA (USA) to save for retirement. I have done my research on Roth IRA's and I do not like what I have found so far.

- Subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty. I am young and I plan to FIRE. I do not want this money tied up for another 30 years. Maybe I FIRE, maybe I want to take a sabbatical, maybe I want to pay rent with investments for awhile, etc.
- Early withdrawal regulations for Roth IRA's are complex. I'll read articles that say things like ""Roth IRA withdrawals are penalty free"" and ""Roth IRA's incur a 10% withdrawal penalty"" and these contradictory phrases will be side by side in the same article.
- All this work to waive a 15% capital gains tax. Income tax is already paid. Doesn't seem like much benefit just to waive 15% capital gains tax.
- My brokerage bank, Ally, doesn't appear to have Roth IRA brokerage accounts. [Only CD and savings.](https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/ira-account/). So I would have to split into 2 brokerage accounts at different banks, which increases complexity. And the second bank would probably charge fees (Ally doesn't charge account fees or trade commissions for the type of trading I do)
- There are major limits on how much can be contributed per year. $6000 seems very low. I like having a minimum number of bank accounts (one checking, one brokerage) and just glancing at one dashboard. I don't really want to make multiple bank accounts at multiple banks just for $6000/yr.

It sounds like there's 3 scenarios that I can be put in:

- Roth IRA, no early withdrawal - I don't withdrawal my money for 30 years and I get 0% capital gains tax
- Roth IRA, early withdrawal - I withdrawal my money early and have to pay 15% capital gains tax + 10% withdrawal penalty = 25%.
- Taxable Account- I keep my single brokerage account (simplicity), and my freedom to withdrawal whenever I want, and just pay a flat 15% no matter when I withdraw.

t3_gj73i5,personalfinance,Rent vs Sell my condo,"I currently live in a condo(paid-off), and plan to expand into a house in the next 1-2 years to support my growing family.  
I need help figuring out what numbers or considerations I should be looking at when deciding whether to sell or rent out my current Condo.

Here's a few numbers.  
Condo costed me **$170k**, would sell for **$200k**(minus $10k for fees).  
Rent in my area is **$1600**. But I have the following monthly costs:  
$320/month HOA fees, $390/month property tax, $20/month insurance. 

New house price target is **$400k**(I have 20% saved up).

**My options are:**

1. Rent out the Condo, and use the $800 cash flow towards the payment of the new house.
2. Sell the condo, use the $190k as a down payment, to lower the house's monthly payments.
3. Sell the condo, invest the $190k in the S&amp;P500.
4. Sell the condo and sell some stocks, buy house with no mortgage payments.

t3_gj6shs,personalfinance,I’m about to get 10k in payroll advances from work... how do I prepare for this?,"Posting from a throwaway. I work for a salon as a cosmetologist. The owner of the salon (and my boss) recently applied and was approved for a small business PPP loan. He notified me and my coworkers today that we would be receiving ~10k in payroll advances, paid out from that loan (the amount is based on how much we earned individually last year, but this was the average amount).

My boss told us all that this money hasn’t been taxed, so we need to save accordingly... About how much should I plan to put away in preparation for taxes? Is the 30% benchmark a good place to start?

Also, what happens if I decide to resign while I still “owe” the salon (e.g., I’ve only worked the equivalent of 5k in wages)? How would that affect money I owe in taxes/etc.? Are there any pieces of documentation I should be sure to get? 

My plan right now is to deposit the sum into my savings, and then withdraw my usual paycheck amount on the dates when I would have been paid.

Sorry if these are stupid questions with obvious answers. There’s so much conflicting information out there on how these PPP loans work— I started to feel really overwhelmed after just a few minutes of research.

t3_gj6mi0,personalfinance,What private student loans should I consider for getting a B.A in Pure Mathematics?,"Hey Reddit,

I consider taking out a private student loan. I know it should be the last resort but I do not know what else I can do. Right now I need to make a choice: either accept the fact that every resume of mine or any application form I have to fill out will always contain ""Education: High School Diploma"" or take out $50,000 in loans to pay the tuition fees and housing. Honestly, I do not know which of the two is worse. I have done all I can to avoid taking out a private loan. I have completed two years at a community college, knocking out all of the utterly useless general education requirements, and have transferred to a local university (not a top university, but quite decent). I'm a math major and intend to go to graduate school for a statistics degree. Now, the university I transferred to, has not offered me anything but federal loans. The federal loans cover only half of the tuition each semester. On top of that, I will be living in a $400-$500 apartment close to campus. Also, I will not be working during the first semester at the new school, since I intend to take a quite heavy course load so that I can graduate in two years and have a good chance at being accepted to a Ph.D. program. I understand that taking private loans should be the last resort, but I have exhausted all options. I have also considered taking Parent Plus loans, but since I will be 24 years old next semester, I will not be eligible for that. Thus, private loans.

Currently, as an in-state resident, I will need to pay $8,500 in tuition fees per semester. I also estimate that I would need about $6000 per year to pay rent plus food. Thus, two semesters at university would cost me $23,000. I need to complete four semesters, hence $46,000 for a B.A in Pure Mathematics. I intend to go to grad school right after undergrad and would like to defer payments until after I finish the graduate program. On the bright side, I will be 24 next year and will be considered an independent student, so I hope the university will take that into consideration and offer me some financial aid.

Now, the reason I'm typing all this: I need your advice on what private student loan lenders I should consider? In particular, I need to pick one that would allow me to DEFER payments until I finish graduate school. I have talked with Sallie Mae about Smart Option Student Loan, and they said that I would be able to defer payments until after I finish grad school. But I'm not sure I believe that. They told me that I would need to call an agent after completing undergrad so that they would defer payments. Could anyone confirm that it's true? If no, what other private loan providers should I consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify a few things. I was awarded $3500 in Stafford loans per semester. That means I would need to find an additional $5000 to pay off the rest of the tuition, and hence I'm considering taking out a private loan. In total,  I would need to borrow $14,000 in Stafford loans and about $32,000 in private loans to pay for the entire undergrad degree. Secondly, I should have mentioned something about the career I'm pursuing -- machine learning (basically applied statistics). It's quite difficult to get a job in the industry straight out of undergrad unless you go to a top school, so most ML positions require a graduate degree. What I'm worried about is that  I won't be allowed to defer payments and would need to start paying off the undergrad debt while in grad school.

t3_gj6g1x,personalfinance,Should I sell my car to buy a newer but cheaper one?,"A few years ago I made an impulsive decision and bought a 2007 Boxster while I was 19 and still living at home. I bought it for $18kish and ended up putting around $10k worth of repairs into it over the course of the last few years (IMS bearing is a killer). It's all paid off and I am no longer living at home. After those repairs I said to myself I would run it into the ground to make it worth the money I threw at it.

While I still absolutely love the car, it doesn't have quite the same ""wow"" factor it once had. It has 69,000 miles on it so the plan would be to hopefully sell it for around $13k and buy a newer cheaper car for $8k leaving me with an extra $5kish to put towards a down payment on my first house (which I don't plan on looking for one for another year and a half. It also wouldn't make or break the down payment.)

The financially responsible thing to me would be to sell it, but I still really enjoy driving it and every other car I touch just seems off. Idk if that's simply because I'm not used to them. I'm afraid the minute I sell it I would regret it.

So the question is, is the $5k (and cheaper gas and maintenance) worth it? Or should I keep my ""live while I'm young"" attitude and enjoy it while I can?

t3_gj6dwh,personalfinance,How to find grants/other programs to assist w/ first-time house downpayment?,"I am saving for a downpayment on my first house, living in a HCOL area (Los Angeles). I figure I'll be looking for a home in the mid 400's, (definite starter home/lower end of market here) and want to put 20% down (90k).

My gross pretax household income is about 180k yr (spouse and I earn about the same), have finally paid off everything, so no debts.

90k in cash is incredibly hard to save up, while saving for retirement at the same time. We currently have about 40k saved, but we're interested in any assistance programs which may augment that, and allow us to buy a home sooner.

What are ways to find these types of programs? Online info is often out of date and/or its confusing how to apply , confirm we are within the allowed income, or even confirm there are funds left in the program. 

Will our realtor know about these programs/grants? 

Are there other professionals we should consult to help w/ this specifically?

t3_gj67ay,personalfinance,I am about to lose $3000 with a dispute if Wayfair cannot locate the refund that Chase sent it back to them. What should I do?,"So this is a long story..

&amp;#x200B;

 

I placed an online order of coffee machine ($3119.43) from Wayfair on December 20th of 2019. The item supposed to arrive on the Dec 23rd and I received a box empty. I called Wayfair immediately for help on the same night and they told me to dispute the charge since they couldn’t help with that. I called Chase the next morning to start the dispute process (December 24th). Soon after the call with Chase the item showed up at my door but at this point it was too late. The item was supposed to be the Xmas gift for my friend and I received after Xmas so there was no point to keep. I already initiated the dispute with Chase earlier so I called Chase again to cancel the dispute and start the return process to receive my money back because it would be wrong to start a dispute but having an item in hand. I mailed it back to Wayfair on the 26th of December around 12:24 PM with the tracking number and I received a refund confirmation from the email for the refund of $3069.85 immediately after I dropped of the package (full amount minus the shipping charge of $49.58). Ever since then I have never received the refund from Wayfair for the any amount whatsoever. I called Wayfair after one week to check my refund status and they told me they received the item back and they are now aware of the dispute I placed. I told Wayfair I canceled the dispute, returned the item back to Wayfair and all I need know is to receive a refund because technicially the dispute was cancelled and I returned the merchandise. They agreed to it and the last communication I received from Wayfair was around January 3rd. Wayfair told me they already refunded me but I wasn’t sure if they referenced to the dispute or the actual item that I returned back to them. After a few weeks of unsuccessfully retrieving the refund, I went back to Chase and re-initiated the dispute with my credit card company on January of 26th providing all the information I had at the time including the tracking number and the refund confirmation email from Wayfair but I never received any money back. Ever since the reopen dispute with Chase in the late of January I never heard back from Chase or any updates from Chase. I assumed they were taking time to investigate because of the complication process (open-cancel-reopen) and with the COVID-19 I thought the process was taking longer than usual. However, on April 3rd, Chase sent me the later saying the charge is valid  and the fund were returned back to Wayfair on 1/7/2020 when I canceled the dispute on 12/26/2020. Chase cannot assist me any further. It is up to Wayfair to find the fund. I was furious and lost so I decided to call Wayfair and Chase again as a liaison to ask for the latest status. I spoke to this person named C from Advocacy team from Wayfair (4/24/2020) and was advised that Wayfair accepted the dispute report received from my bank and accepted the refund credit to be issued to me through my financial institution which doesn’t make any sense. I thought she referenced the original dispute so I had to send an email and explain the whole story to her but she never responded. I decided to call Chase again and spoke to B (Chase Dispute Supervisor) and she said that Chase already canceled the refund and the fund went back to Wayfair and advised me to call Wayfair to ask them where the fund is (I found this similar to the letter I received from Chase on April 3rd). At this point I was transferred to J who is also the customer advocacy at Wayfair (4/27/2020) and she advised me if Chase already canceled the refund then it would be an ARN number (confirmation number?) showing the bank send the funds over to Wayfair. I called Chase again and spoke to B this morning (5/5/2020) and asked her what the ARN number would be when Chase sent back the fund to Wayfair and she didn’t know but keep telling me to wait and wait. B mentioned that it should take up to 45 days for the merchant to receive the fund back to their bank account but it looks like it has been almost 130 days at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

After too long to handle this issue, I finally filed a complaint with Chase on CFPB to get more lights regarding this whole issue. I thought the issue could be solved but Chase Excutive team got back to me with the same response that I received from Chase Dispute Team but now having the ARN number. I was so happy and thought this will help me very much. I gave Wayfair the official letter with all related information but as of this morning I received a call from Wayfair saying the ARN number I provided was the first ARN number when I initiated the dispute. The second ARN (rebill) couldn't be locate and they have no clue.

t3_gj5wbd,personalfinance,Vanguard no longer allowing checks sent by bill pay from banks,"I got an email from Vanguard because they received my bill pay check from the bank for depositing money to my IRA. The email says that starting July 15th, they will no longer be accepting deposits in this manner. They suggest that I add my bank account number to their site so they can pull the money in, or that I can upload paper checks to their app for deposit. I called to express my displeasure, but I'm curious. Are people ok with this? Am I in the minority for being pissed that such a basic thing as bank bill pay is being removed as an option?

My reasoning for not attaching my bank info to Vanguard is firstly that I don't let people pull from my bank. I only push money out. And secondly it's stupid for me to give 10 institutions my info for them to pull instead of one institution instructions to push. I can't imagine what a pain it the ass it would be to change banks and have to go to everyone that I pay and switch the account information. Why would I consider that when I can just use bill pay to organize everything in one place?

As for the app, I guess that's a somewhat reasonable option other than the fact that I only keep about ten checks for my bank account. I mean, who uses paper checks anymore? Not me, because *I use bill pay* for everything that can't be done with my credit card. If need be, I guess I will go with this option and probably only send money in once a quarter or so.

Vanguard says that they're trying to increase processing times and decrease situations where they aren't sure how the money should be treated. But...that just doesn't fly for me. I've never once had them come back to me to ask me what the check they received is meant for. And if they did, they have a contact portal through which they can easily address the question. I have never once complained about the processing time for my check. If I did, they would be more than welcome to offer the above solutions as faster options for me.

I'm just astonished that Vanguard would decide that bank bill pay is no longer an option for depositing money, and wondering if I'm an outlier in thinking that this is not an acceptable decision for a company who keeps so much of my money to make. I'm interested in hearing what others thoughts are on this. Maybe I'm just being picky and old fashioned to stick with a system that has worked for many, many years?","Vanguard no longer allowing checks sent by bill pay from banksI got an email from Vanguard because they received my bill pay check from the bank for depositing money to my IRA.

t3_gj5fs8,personalfinance,How do I handle my parents lying about car insurance?,"So...I want to get a cheap used car soon, but I found out that my parents have a weird insurance scheme.

My father wants me to change the address on my license and put the car title in my mother's name (my dad doesn't work, so everything is in her name), because then they'll just add me as a named driver and will get cheaper insurance that way.

I won't be putting her name on the title because I'm the one paying for the car. I'm also pretty sure that I'm required to be on the insurance anyway, because I live at the same residence.

My father is actually pretending to not be married to my mother, and has a different address on his license. I heard her and him on the phone with the insurance company, and my mother clearly said she was single. My parents have been married since before I was born.

So. My parents are refusing to budge. I don't want to commit fraud by pretending we're not related or like I live somewhere else. I also really will not ever put their names on my car title because I don't want to deal with their scams. They actually got audited by the IRS awhile ago...and I'm suspicious they just want the title in their names to steal it from me.

What can I do? The issue is that I think my father may have excluded me from the car insurance without telling me, like filling out the exclusion form and sending it to the insurance company. I got my license last year and from what I've read, I should have been automatically added to the policy by the company whether my parents wanted it or not. My father handles all the finances and will do anything to save money.

But I don't know what really happened or what to do or anything really...

**As a sidenote:** My parents for some reason keep pretending to want to buy me a car and then pull out at the last minute. The most recent incident was my father saying he'll make my mother give me $5,000 after they sell their house, so I can pay for college or a car. He wants to pay half and I pay the other half. But my parents have never helped me out financially and especially not with big purchases. I mentioned buying a car with 100% my money, and neither of them seemed to care. Is it possible my father is pretending to offer me $5K to entice me to give him money so he can steal it? Has anyone heard of that before?","How do I handle my parents lying about car insurance?So...I want to get a cheap used car soon, but I found out that my parents have a weird insurance scheme.

t3_gj5apj,personalfinance,MAJOR warning if you have a Great Lakes student loan right now,"TLDR; Great Lakes submitted the WRONG student loan status code to the three credit bureaus for ALL of their customers with student loans (as part of the CARES act) and it's causing everyone's credit scores to drop 40-50 points.

I'm in the midst of buying a house and my lender pulled my credit yesterday. She told me what it was and I was shocked, it was lower than I thought. I know numbers fluctuate from free services like Discover and Credit Karma, so I looked at Credit Karma to see the numbers from two of the bureaus, and sure enough, a MAJOR drop of 45 points on both of them over a 4 day update period. I know the numbers themselves aren't super accurate, but the trends sure are.

I saw some articles on this subreddit today alluding to this issue but I wanted to verify the info. I googled and found ONE article about this [here](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/student-loan-borrowers-discover-significant-drop-credit-score-following-cares-act-protections/DBNHS5ODKBCNHOE7VKU3RWNFVI/). It was actually pretty informative and accurate.

I called Great Lakes and a woman confirmed that it was true: their company had provided the wrong 'code' to the credit bureaus, essentially causing everyone's student loans to look they are in REAL forbearance/deferral. I asked if it was worth looking at my account to see if I was one of the ones affected and she told me that it wasn't necessary because it affected everyone across the board. Wut.

My follow up was 'when is this going to be fixed?' and she said on May 31st they send their normal monthly report to the three bureaus and it will have the correction in there and will set everyone's accounts back (yeah right! Trust but verify!). As for when the bureaus will fix it once they receive the new information, I am still sitting on hold with one of them now to find out.

The last thing I asked her was if this was written publicly anywhere so that I can show my lender proof of this information. She said that they don't have it posted anywhere. WTF! No press release, no statement, NOTHING. Feels weird to know about something that affects so many people, yet there's only one article on it.

I'll update this post once I talk to someone at TransUnion. What a crazy year.

**EDIT: Since Credit Karma pulls Vantage Scores, I wanted to see what my FICO scores were. I signed up for a free trial with Experian's service that gives me access to all 3 bureaus' credit FICO 8 scores. It also has, just for Experian scores, a breakdown of a specific credit score for mortgage, auto lending, and credit cards. The  only one that was slightly low, at the level my lender would have seen, was the mortgage one. I cannot see 'trends' here to see if it had dropped recently.**

**Conclusively, I cannot confirm yet for SURE whether my lender uses a FICO 2, FICO 8, or Vantage score. Going to talk to them this morning.**

**EDIT: Sidenote cuz I thought this was pretty cool: as part of the trial of the experian service (and I would hope the other bureaus have something similar), you can use a 'score simulator' to click scenarios to see specifically what your credit score will do when you get a new credit card, pay off credit card balances, close down a credit card, etc. Thought that was pretty cool. It's only on the FICO 8 score model though, not the mortgage, auto, or credit card one.**

**EDIT: My mortgage lender talked to the credit company and they said they use the following scores to determine my rates:**  
**Experian: Fair Isaac v2**  
**Transunion - FICO Classic 4**  
**Equifax - FICO Classic**

I'd prefer to have just one active account for the time being. Should I withdraw all my funds out of Vanguard and move them to M1? Is it okay to have an empty Vanguard account or should I close it?

I'm trying to figure this all out just by researching so I would really appreciate some advice!",1,college starting roth irahi college k saving contribute roth ira account month ago bank however research actually picking etf stock seems somewhat keep track pie portfolio plan researching finance look easier automate thing prefer one active account time move okay empty account close trying figure researching really appreciate
t3_gj585p,personalfinance,Debt and Purchasing a First Home,"Hi All, longtime reader but have a few questions, and a few more given the interesting circumstances that we're currently living through. 

I've been planning to purchase my first house for a little while now and been working towards it. I'm tired of paying rent and certain I'm staying in my current city for the foreseeable future considering my partner and I have started a business here. The rub is, I've gone quite a bit into credit card debt (around $15k) over the past 2 years as we got the business established. I'm back to a good paying job within my field and he has secured sales growth and funding to ensure his paycheck (and stability for business). 

It's definitely possible for us to  continue to work for another 1-2 years and aggressively pay down the debt while still renting. However, I'd really like to make the jump sooner rather than later if possible. My state has a first time home buyer down payment assistance grant that several friends have used and highly recommend, so I'll likely use that even if I do have a down payment of my own. We are not married so I will be purchasing the house myself as per advice I've seen on here (and he filed bankruptcy for medical debt 4 years ago as well, so part of the reason). 

Prior to the credit card debt I had excellent credit and my score is still impeccable outside of the high (95%) utilization rate. I've looked at some calculators and gotten advice, but it seems that in order to quality for my state's mortgage/down payment program I'll need to raise my credit score by substantially dropping my CC balances. I just so happen to have about $15k in 2 retirement accounts from previous jobs, one of which I need to roll over into a new account or at least address in some way. 

My long winded question is, could I use these retirement funds to wipe out my remaining credit card debt, raise my score, and finally begin the process of purchasing a home? I know you're not supposed to touch these things, but it feels like a semi-good option to get into home ownership, which is its own form of retirement/wealth building. 

Any and all advice is much appreciated!","Debt and Purchasing a First HomeHi All, longtime reader but have a few questions, and a few more given the interesting circumstances that we're currently living through.

t3_gj55f1,personalfinance,Financial Education for Teens?,"Hi all!  

I've spent most of my life bouncing between good and bad credit.  I'm finally in a place where my debt is manageable and decreasing, and my credit report is free from derogatory accounts and information.

Because I spent half my life with poor credit, I am a huge advocate of teaching kids to manage their credit and finances as early as possible.  I spout off about it as often as possible, and I was pretty sure that no one listened.  Evidently my niece was actually paying attention!  Her mother is on the streets so she lives with one of my other sisters.  She asked if we could teach her about finances and good credit, something she knows nothing about.  I'm soooo excited to get her started!

That brings me to my question, what are the things that we should be educating our teens about to prepare them for their financial future?  I am thinking how to read a check stub, how taxes work, getting and maintaining a bank account (the minor bank account thread is what finally pushed me to ask this question), interest rates/credit cards/good vs. bad debt.  Of course that's just a high level idea of topics, what else do you think would be a good addition to helping her be financial knowledgeable?  Are there any tools or sites you would recommend?  She's bored and needs something to do so our plan is to give her a topic once a week or so and having her research and then we can discuss in detail what she learns and how to apply it to future decisions and actions.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!","Financial Education for Teens?Hi all!

t3_gj4fdz,personalfinance,Help! Best way to bank to save for multiple things at once?,"If relevant, 23y Canadian and I currently bank with BMO.
I’m currently putting money away into a savings account for 3 things: 
-down payment on a house
-my “adventure fund” for trips/fun stuff
-my general savings/emergency money

Im currently putting everything into the same account because it’s a very high interest account. When I discussed this with my bank they just gave me the one account and I just didn’t think anything of it, but it’s made it difficult to tell what money is for what, or how much I’ve spent on trips vs how much I have saved up for a house.

Is there a drawback if I separate this money into 3 different accounts? I’m hoping to get the house in the next 2-3 years so that account would only be temporary, other two would be basically permanent unless I switch banks. I just find it strange that they only gave me one account when I implied I wanted 3, so If only having one account gives me an advantage I’m unaware of then it would be nice to know of it. I’m just trying to get the most bang for my buck while making it as simple for myself as possible.

Apologies if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. Please let me know if that's the case.

I'm 27 and 4(ish) years into my career (5 if you count part time work before graduation). I've worked at a few different places in my field at this point and have realized it's not my ""forever field"" if that makes sense. Around about a year in, I get tired of the job and move on to somewhere else. The problem is, I don't want to leave my current job just to go to another job and have the same thing happen. 

I think the main thing I have realized is that sitting at a desk for 40-45 hrs/wk is not my cup of tea. None of my hobbies outside of work involve being still, so why would my career? My hobbies are woodworking, gardening, and vehicle restoration. However, I'm not good enough to make any of these a well paying career. I have realized that I like being in motion and I like working with my hands. 

So...how did you switch fields for people who have? I make \~$50k per year and wouldn't be too happy taking a massive pay cut. I am currently paying of high-interest debt while I build my savings, so I don't have a substantial savings built up to where I could just leave. 

I realize this may not be the best economic environment to do this in, so I will likely stay put until I have something else secured. Just looking for options right now. 

Have you ever switched career paths? Where did you switch from and where did you go? How did you handle it financially? How old were you when you did it. 

Would love any advice from folks who have done this and are wiser than I. Thank you in advance.","Not happy in my field, what do I do?Hi r/personalfinance \-

t3_gj441i,personalfinance,County lost my property tax payment--Should I now overpay or underpay property taxes (CA)?,"I bought my home in 2019, and received an $8000 tax bill 3/2020 (county took forever to re-assess property).  Also in 3/2020 I refinanced my mortgage and the title company sent the county a $7000 check to cover any property tax due.  So by my calculations I need to pay $1000, due by 5/31.

However, the county's online tax portal says I still owe $8000.  The title company has sent me a copy of the cleared check which shows the County has received and deposited the funds, and the correct parcel number is clearly listed on the check.  

After multiple calls (with &gt;1 hour hold times), each time they say they have *not* received the check and transfer me to different offices/people who do not pick up.  I have emailed and faxed them the copy of the cleared check too. I cannot go to the their offices (closed due to COVID), and there seems to be nobody at the County who can give me a straight answer.

**Question**:  I have a feeling it's going to take a while for them to ""find"" the $7000 they already deposited.  But since the $8000 is due before May 31, do I:

* A) Pay the county only the balance I think is due ($1000)?  I am sure if I only give them $1000 they will charge me penalties (and maybe place a lien on my house?) which will take multiple phone calls to reverse once they find the $7000.

* B) Pay the entire tax bill ($8000)  and then try to appeal for a refund later?  At least this way I won't get penalties/lien assessed, but I have a feeling it will be an uphill battle to recover my $7000 overpayment.

Along with this, I plan to get added onto my father's credit card and piggyback off of his 800+ credit score. I've heard this is a great thing to do, obviously only if that person is reliable. 

Wait a couple of months to have that impact hit my credit score then attempt to apply for a 0% balance transfer for 18 months credit card. If approved, hopefully for a decent amount, I will then transfer my business card debt to the new card paying monthly without getting interest charges. If that all works out I can attack this debt over the 18 months and have it paid off. 

The only concern so far is student loan debt. I have not made any payments towards it and hopefully will have bigger cashflow by September to make big impact payments.

t3_gj3sgj,personalfinance,Best way to approach medical debt in collections?,"I have about $500 of medical debt in collections.

I've seen many posts regarding requesting verification, and negotiating these bills with the collectors, but before I pick up the phone and say the wrong thing, I'd like some advice.

1) No / minimal impact to credit

t3_gj3gl9,personalfinance,"Questions on Roth IRA, High Yield Savings Account, Unemployment Funds - Beginner","Hi everyone,

This subreddit is AMAZING. Thanks to whoever created this, and thanks to everyone who contributes. 

So I've been doing reading through some posts, and I want to make sure I make sense...

I'm 28 (I know...pretty late), and I finished graduate school at the end of summer 2019. I'm not working at all right now, and I'm living at home. The job search hasn't been that great to me, unfortunately. I left my part-time job in January to focus more on the job search...then the pandemic hit. -\_-

My expenses at the moment are very minimal: Car and car insurance expenses, groceries, and store credit cards. I deferred my graduate student loans another year based on the income I made at my previous job. I don't have a 401K because either I've worked part-time jobs or IC jobs. 

I got approved for UI, and I should be getting my card in the mail by the end of the week. I chose to withhold taxes on my UI funds.

This is the plan I have for the next two months (hopefully this is correct): 

1. Pay off store credit cards - $2000 worth
2. Create an emergency fund through a high yield savings account. Planning to put the settlement I received from a car accident into this account. Seems like Capital One, Ally, and Discover are the big contenders from what I'm reading.
3. Open a Roth IRA. Seems like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard are the most popular ones. Sidenote, I honestly don't think I'll be getting married for another 5 years.
4. Start life insurance back up again. I was planning on doing this when I get my FT role.

Would love feedback on my plan, but I do have questions:

1. How did you decide on which bank/brokerage was for you? 
2. For the Roth IRA, I can definitely contribute to 2019 at the max with part of the settlement, but I already filed my taxes back in February. My income for 2019 was less than $20K. Did I qualify for the Saver's Credit? If so, do I need to file an amendment?
3. When I do open the Roth IRA, should I go for a target date fund? Or...?
4. Lastly, I have Series EE savings bonds that I received between the ages of 0-13. Two of them will be at maturity in 18 months, the others are halfway matured. I've checked the values of all of them already. Should I wait until all of the bonds are matured? I don't really have a need for using them at the moment, other than saving up for my own place in the future.

Thanks so much!","Questions on Roth IRA, High Yield Savings Account, Unemployment Funds - BeginnerHi everyone,

t3_gj3177,personalfinance,At a loss of how to help my parents who were evicted in Jan and now live with me.,"Hi everyone. I feel like I should have written this months ago, but I need help and was hoping for some advice from people smarter than me. I am 26 and in January I found out that my parents were evicted from their home. We had only four days (from when they told me--they kept me in the dark for the month that they knew) to put everything away into a storage unit and they now live with me and my fiance. It was a blur, to say the least.

My parents both only have high school diplomas. My dad is the kind of person who buys those get rich quick books and is an ""entrepreneur."" My mom didn't have a job for 15 years until the recession in 2008. Since then, she worked odd jobs as a brand ambassador for marketing companies.

They came to me with tons of debt and now are having trouble finding jobs. COVID obviously has not helped; my dad found a job where he was making a decent bit of money but lost that due to the pandemic. My mom has been driving for Uber Eats and my fiance recently made me aware of how that'll hurt her when tax season rolls around next year. She is living with my sister three hours away because my fiance's job was very strict about minimizing risk of spreading COVID since he is still going into the office.

They have two cars with loans out on both. Thousands of dollars of debt. With just the cars, car insurance, phone bills, storage rental, and whatever essential bills they have to pay, they have around 800 in monthly expenses.

I don't know if that's sufficient information. I'll happily add more. All of this came less than a month after my engagement and obviously it has been really hard to come down from something so exciting to...this. I'm a teacher and my fiance is an accountant. We make okay money and save a good bit but live in a high cost of living area. We were looking to buy a house but I don't know what's even financially feasible anymore. I would appreciate any ideas you all have for me.

Thanks in advance.

So I'm 20 YO and have a stable income of around £30k / year,  instead of just keeping this money in a savings account I want to invest it into index funds that would see a better return such as FTSE 100.

- I want to immediately go in with £1000 but then monthly add to this with a couple hundred, is this advisable or is it better to save and stick with bigger lump sums?

- I was looking at opening a shares account through my bank but are there any other places I should look first?

- Also what sort of estimated return % would you guess based on past experience, I know this isn't gospel and nothing is guaranteed.

- Also what sort of estimated return % would you guess based on past experience, I know this isn't gospel and nothing is guaranteed.


Lastly, would you advise doing the above based on my current situation I've provided?

t3_gj2q7j,personalfinance,"House Hack vs. ""Condo Hack""","I'm very aware that the smartest way to go about owning a home would be to do the traditional house hack of putting the DP in, and then having an outside person pay rent to cover the mortgage.

I am almost never home, and I have a roommate likes that a lot, and who wants to move around the same time as I do, so I am going to have her pay 1/2 of the rent of the other condos, as another stream of income.

Water, Trash and Gas is paid for by the HOA, which is $300 a month. (Is this a good price? it seems like it to me)

I live at home so no rent or utilities all I pay for is insurance, phone, gas, food, and whatever else comes up.

My question is should I get a car while I don’t have any of the big bills to worry about, or should I save my money and not worry about a new car?",1,new carhi name charles year freshman year college went smoothly year buy new car car right probably car looking mustang ecoboost premium nice leather touch screen cost mile car subaru wrx premium cost mile car toyota solara mile horrible time thinking getting loan rest money pay job year payment car insurance per month roughly month month live home rent utility pay insurance phone gas whatever else come question car big bill worry save money worry new car

There’s a few ways that I can think of, one is her buying the house outright in her name and we pay her monthly payments until we pay off the original house price plus a bit more, which would save us at least 100k over a 30 year mortgage. Another option is her just giving us the money and we buy the house in our name and pay her, except there’s the gift tax.

t3_gj219w,personalfinance,Merchant charged me 3 times with a card on file without my permission for $4500,"I purchased something from a merchant in the industry I work with for ($2200). It is not uncommon in this industry for merchants to keep your card on file for future payments. Two weeks after the first purchase, I noticed another charge for $1500 from this merchant. I called them asked them what was going on and they claimed it was a mistake that a new employee made and that they would refund the money. I waited a couple weeks to see the refund in my account and saw nothing. Two weeks later, two more charges from this same merchant for $1500 each, so at this point $4500 in unapproved charges. He said he had initiated the refund and was waiting for it to clear but at this point I didn't believe a word this guy was saying so I reached out to my bank, Chase, and told them that I wanted to chargeback these three purchases as I had never approved them. This was all back in January.

Chase credited me the money while this was happening and it just showed on my statement as a reversal of the original charge so I assumed this was taken care of. Fast forward three months and I wake up to all three charges back on my card statement which closes in 4 days. I called the merchant and he insists that he never fought the disputes, and showed me emails through square showing that he accepted them. However he literally filmed himself in his gmail account and I saw another dispute in there for $2000 that had the exact same thing going on. Somehow, Chase still sided with him and Square and now I need to send Chase an email to potentially open up the chargeback again.

I'm terrified that I somehow was scammed and it seems completely insane that this is possible when credit cards are supposed to have buyer protection for reasons exactly like this. He is somewhat responsive when I contact him and keeps insisting that he's doing what he can to get me my money back but after doing some more in-depth research on the business it seems like he has a history of scamming people out of a good amount of money. What can I do to get my money back?

t3_gj1zg8,personalfinance,"Is a ""better"" degree worth more debt?","Hi,

My fiancee and I would love some feedback regarding how to proceed. Fiancee (34) recently got her Associates degree and is wanting to move forward with her bachelors. She has no debt from her A.A. (yay grants!) and she would like to finish as quickly as possible without sacrificing the quality of her education. 

She was strongly considering ASU because they have an online program in her area of interest and experience (Media and Mass Comm), but to finish would be about 30k and 1.5-2 years. Of course, there are other programs like WGU and Northern Arizona University that have flat fees ($3000) for 6 month terms. However, they only offer Business degrees which are not as intriguing for her.

We are torn because we want to make a smart decision for our future. I wish there was a more affordable program that aligned with her passion. She also worries about employers judging her based on a degree from WGU and NAU. What are your thoughts? We appreciate any feedback!","Is a ""better"" degree worth more debt?Hi,

t3_gj1sm4,personalfinance,23 year old with decent job looking for best path forward with debt management/house purchasing/Auto Buying decisions/ money saving,"Looking for advice

I'll try and keep this short. Here's a quick run down.

Background:
-23y/o graduated school May '19 
-Live at home with parents for now rent-free
-Work full time at a Fortune 100 company.
-$53,476.8 salary before tax. 
-9% of pre-tax salary goes to 401(k) 
-Takehome pay is about $37,128.54 annually ($1,428.09 every 2 weeks)
-Looking to buy a house within 12 months 

Expenses: 
Car (currently waiting for it to sell as I feel this is my first step)
-$401/month for 66 more months 

-Insurance - $276/month (have a 2nd car to drive to/from work that I will keep once the car with a note sells) - so insurance should drop as well. I'm thinking to about $120 or so. 

-Fuel: roughly $200-$225 a month give or take. 32mi each way to work. Nothing to really do about that 

-Student Loans: $307.77/month for 9 more years :(

-Credit Card Debt: 
2,078.17 - working on paying down. I am almost there. 

Savings: I'd like to save $1,000 a month while I can, but I'm being told I'm trying to oversave. Currently I am only saving $400 a month. Which I feel is not enough. What happens when you run into an emergency for 2k or so, that sets you back by 3 months. (This is all aside from retirement contributions).

When I sell my car, that will put a little over 5k into my savings from equity. I do not plan to pay my CC debt with that. I will keep paying from my checks. Out of sight out of mind. 

My other car has 127k miles and seems to be a great reliable car that could last many more years, but it's always a gamble. Worth roughly $7000-$7500. I own it. 

My question is, when I sell my first car, should I liquidate the 2nd car as well? With plans to replace it with something with lower mileage/newer? 

If I liquidated both vehicles, that'd put about 12k in my savings. 

But then I will need to replace it with another car. 

If this is the case, should I get a loan for something that has my payments no more than 300? I'm unsure whether to use that 12k to keep saving for when I move out or if I should use some of it for the newer car. 

The only issue with keeping the 2nd car, is it will eventually need to be replaced, just like any car, and I'd imagine that is when I'll have a mortgage in my name. 

I'm just trying to figure out my best path forward so I don't screw myself later on because once I move out, I feel as if I am not going to have a whole lot of money left over for myself or for savings - which I can't seem to stop thinking about. 

What is a recommended amount to save as well? 

Just trying to get up off of my feet and not struggle with money for years to come and when things get more difficult (house, marriage, kids(not for a long time), etc..)

I started searching online for solutions some sort of relief and I found ClearOne Advantage a debt ""relief"" program. They promised the moon and paying only 50% of what i owe on average and will be out of debt twice as fast. 

Naturally i did some research but was under too much pressure to REALLY dive deep, I signed up. I'm now five months in they have three of my creditors agreed to structured settlements. 

I just feel lost and I also feel like doing this i'm completely fucked in credit for the next seven years. 

Is there something else i can do? At this point i'm now 5 months late on my other creditors that haven't gone to settlement and owe for lack of an exact number greater than 10k but less 15k. 

Should i back out of the program? What should i do?

t3_gj1hl3,personalfinance,Housing Dilemma,"  Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this. If not please let me know. 

I was meant to start graduate school abroad this fall. That isn’t looking likely – however, I might be able to start in the spring (January). Currently my lease expires July 31. I could renew, but my apartment complex only does 12-month leases. I could renew my lease, but if I leave for the spring semester (January – May or June), then I would have to sublet my apartment. I don’t really have another choice – I couldn’t break the lease, and the apartment has already made it clear they won’t do month by month or a 6-month lease. I can’t afford any of the apartments with shorter leases in my city because shorter lease = more expensive rent. I can’t move back in with my family because my parents are deceased and my sister simply doesn’t have the room for me to be able to live with her. 

Is renewing my lease and banking on being able to sublet for the spring the right thing to do financially? Do I have any other options I’m not aware of? For reference, it’s a college town and if I stay here, I am guaranteed a job (will just continue with the one I have until I leave). I don’t know how coronavirus will affect this, but it’s generally pretty easy to find someone to sublet an apartment. There’s also the issue of – what if I renew my lease and it turns out I will be able to go abroad this fall? That’s extremely unlikely, I know, but if that happens I’d end up having to find someone to either take over my lease entirely or sublet from me for the whole year. 

I’m a college graduate and soon to be graduate student with not a lot of money and nowhere to go if I don’t figure something out myself, so figuring out my housing is extremely important. Any input is appreciated – thank you.","Housing Dilemma  Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this. If not please let me know.

t3_gj1giy,personalfinance,I'm 26 years old and applying to grad school next year. How much should I be putting into my retirement vs. savings account?,"I'm 26 years old and recently started a job making $71k/year (up from $45k/year at my last job).  I have no debt of any kind. My assets include:

* Savings (Ally HYSA): $29k 
* Roth 401k: $21k
* Roth IRA: $12k

My most significant fixed costs are $830/month rent, $80/month for health insurance, $40/month to charity, and $35/month for cell/data service. Unfortunately, my new job doesn't provide any 401k match until after my first year, then they will match up to 6%. I've been putting in 10% of my paycheck anyway since I started about a month ago. My current plan is to put $750 from each paycheck into savings, which totals to $18k/year. I realize that I could max out my Roth IRA and/or contribute more to my 401k if I put less into my savings for graduate school. 

I plan on applying to master's of public health (MPH) next year, which means I would enroll in the Fall of 2022. The full tuition (not including any potential financial aid) of the MPH programs that I am looking at range from $35k to $70k. The MPH will take me out of the workforce for 1-2 years, depending on the program. I've basically hit the ceiling of what I can make in my field without an advanced degree. 

Here's my question: how should I prioritize contributing to my retirement savings vs. saving for graduate school? Here are some of my concerns:

* The power of compound interest has been pounded into me, so I know that contributing to my retirement in my 20s is important. However, I hate the idea of substantial debt and I worry that the interest rates that I would need to pay on potential loans would outweigh the interest earned on my retirement savings during the same period. 
* Would having a substantial sum in my savings account ($50-60k) when applying to grad school hurt my chances of receiving need-based aid? It would be frustrating to be penalized for saving. 

Thanks for the help.","I'm 26 years old and applying to grad school next year. How much should I be putting into my retirement vs. savings account?I'm 26 years old and recently started a job making $71k/year (up from $45k/year at my last job).  I have no debt of any kind. My assets include:

She is low-income and definitely does not have much that we can use towards her medical expenses.

t3_gj1b5a,personalfinance,Ask my realtor to pay my inspection and attorney fees??,"Good morning everyone! First off, I would like to thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read and respond to this post. Second, I am a first time home buyer so please bear with me if this is a silly question. And the post is lengthy so I’m warning y’all in advance!

I told my parents the other day that the house I’m buying is a house that I found myself on Redfin and that I asked the realtor I was working with to schedule a showing for me - the past couple months that’s how it has been. My realtor sends me places through MLS and if I like a place, he’ll schedule or if I find a place on Zillow or Redfin then I’ll ask him to schedule a showing. So basically, my parents are saying since I found the place on Redfin myself and my realtor is there to just represent me that I should ask him to pay my inspection &amp; attorney fees. Furthermore, they went on to say that when they bought their home that my mom found our home while it was having an open house on her own while she was driving in the neighborhood and at that time she didn’t have a realtor so she put in an offer, got accepted but didn’t have someone to represent her so she called a realtor and the realtor told her that he would cover the inspection &amp; attorney costs. (This was in 2001) 

I see where they’re coming from but I’m kind of hesitant to ask my realtor because during this day and age, I think it’s pretty standard for home buyers to find places they like on Zillow/Redfin on their own and view them in addition to viewing places the realtor sends through MLS. I love my realtor, he has been extremely helpful and informative throughout the whole process and been representing me very well, I feel which is another reason why I’m hesitant to ask. That being said, I read somewhere that some people use a buyers agent that will refund the buyer a part of their commission. Knowing that information, I don’t think it would hurt to ask my realtor but I don’t want to offend him (of course I’ll ask in a way where it’s not offensive, if I do).

What do you guys think??

I’d much prefer a career in the non-profit sector, but their pay is pretty dismal compared to what I make in the private sector. I’ve told myself that when my husband and I are debt-free, I will quit the corporate grind.

2. Invest and quit my job when my investment pool &gt; my debts (using that pool to pay my remaining debts monthly/dampen the pain of a reduced income)

t3_gj10cj,personalfinance,Feeling uneasy about my sailboat mortgage,"I would like to hear your thoughts on my sailboat ownership situation. There may be no issue here, but I think I need some input anyway.
Just over a year ago I bought a 1988 41' sailboat that is my primary residence. I found a rather unique boat that had been both exceptionally cared for and received huge upgrades in the past 5 years. It was listed at twice the price of the other identical model year boats. I worked the seller down to a price about 60% above all of the other identical boats, and then had it surveyed. 
The surveyor gave it flying colors, he was very impressed. He valued the boat right at the price I had agreed to pay, and explained he had to find different boats to use as comps because this boat was in wildly better shape than the sister boats and had massive recent upgrades.
So I bought the boat and have loved every second I've owned it since. My girlfriend and I have taken it everywhere and continued to put in the hours to maintain it to perfection. 

The reason I post here, is while I can justify the boat and its value in my head, I seem to live with the constant stress that if I need to sell the boat in 2 or 3 years to have kids, will the next surveyor just value it at the other sister boats average sale price, 
 making me the fool for buying at a premium? 

I know its an open ended question, but it stresses me out every time I see another boat go on the market for half the price (albeit in poorer condition by far).

Some financial details if it helps:
- I paid 10% down.
- 3 years from now I will owe about what the poor condition boats are selling for, so I imagine I wouldn't owe cash upon sale no matter what (hopefully).","Feeling uneasy about my sailboat mortgageI would like to hear your thoughts on my sailboat ownership situation.

t3_giyucy,personalfinance,When will I be able to build my own ETF portfolio?,"Hello everyone,

I think this situation is common for many people lately: In these days I am considering starting a general investment plan with an eventual accumulation plan on [Moneyfarm](https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/). Ideal plan: start with a deposit of 10-15k (maybe in separate installments over 3-5 months to diversify more) and leave it alone for 15-25 years (when I'll be 40-50 years old). At the same time, I am considering to invest on my own on Degiro or Directa (for Italy). I made a quick calculation, not counting the ETFs that have no fees. Considering my starting budget of 10-15k, the fee costs would be around 35-66€ for the inital buy of 7 ETFs. Each subsequent year, I would like to add a budget of 2.4k as part of the accumulation plan, so my annual fees should then amount to 20-66€ + ETFs costs for 7-14 entries per year (1-2 entries per year for 7 ETFs).  MoneyFarm (1% per year on capital + ETF costs, so 1.28%). Of course this calculation is not considering the ETFs that you can buy without fees, which would drastically make my DIY option a lot cheaper, but I made the calculation anyway since I don't know which ETFs are best for my situation.

Looking at JustETF, I realized that I don't have the basis for making a precise and safe asset allocation. I'm not a beginner in finance/economy and I know a few things, but as I said I don't feel ready. On paper I know how to diversify and other principles, but then when it comes to the concrete knowledge I simply which specific ETFs I could use to build my portfolio. The only thing that I know is I want accumulative type ETFs and I want them to be ""reliable"".

So I was wondering, how long does it take to learn how to correctly build a serious portfolio? Moneyfarm seems like a reliable option that builds a portfolio with professional and well-kept criteria, and chooses the right financial instruments. Considering this comparison, how long would it take for me to do a job like theirs on my own? We are talking about savings that I would like to grow over time and not squander through poor choices. Lastly, where can I cultivate my knowledge about ETFs? Also, should I consider a pension fund instead of this..?

Thank you very much for your time.","When will I be able to build my own ETF portfolio?Hello everyone,

t3_gj0z9b,personalfinance,"For all the 2020 graduates and those who are now turning 18, plan ahead to open a new bank account that is solely in your name.","It's generally required for a parent to co-sign a minor's bank account in the US. Once you turn 18, the best course of action is to establish an account in your name ONLY so you have sole control of it. It would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.  Bank personnel can make mistakes and link up what they thought were similar accounts, or give close relatives unwelcome access to accounts in an attempt to be ""helpful"".

There are several reasons for this. Stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control are not uncommon. Parents can have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe. There could be disagreements between parents and their kids over the kid's life choices, so they take the money away as a punishment or for control. It could just be selfishness and greed, so the parents decide to just take the money. Who earned the money in the account doesn't matter. If two people are named on the account, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.  Getting it back can be a difficult legal process, if it's even possible.

Having your own account does not mean that parents can't send money if their child needs it. All they need is the account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account. In addition, PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, or any number of banking apps are available they could use to send money if they're still financially supporting their kids or even just want to occasionally send some money as a gift.

t3_gj0ry1,personalfinance,Moving states and confused on how to calculate tax benefit of one state over the other,"I live in Boston and pay about $183 per pay period in state income tax.

t3_gj0khj,personalfinance,Debt payoff strategy (that is NOT avalanche or snowball),"Hello pf! LTLFTP, yadda yadda yadda...

I'm finally in a position where I can start to really focus on eliminating my (and my wife's) old credit card debt. Everything I'm reading focuses on snowball vs. avalanche methods and while I agree avalanche is better than snowball financially, I started thinking.

If the goal of all of this is to pay the least amount of interest, what if I take the monthly approach of throwing my extra money towards the CC that charges me the most interest in **that month**?

For example: Let's say I have $1000 above and beyond minimum payments to allocate to debt. 



Card | Balance | Rate | Monthly Interest
---|---|----|----|----
A | $8000 | 16.99% | $113.27
B | $9000 | 13.99% | $104.93 
C | $3900 | 26.99% | $87.72 
D | $4000 | 22.99% | $76.63 
E | $4750 | 15.24% | $60.33 
F | $2600 | 24.99% | $54.15 
G | $900 | 8.90% | $6.68 


Snowball would dictate I pay down to completion in this order: G, F, C, D, E, A, B

Avalanche dictates I would pay down to completion in this order: C, F, D, A, E, B, G

But what if instead you pay down by whichever account has the highest interest charge for that particular month? In the above table I would start with my $1000 applied to A. Then next month after paying down A it reaches the point where Card B has the higher interest charge for that month, so I apply my extra $1000 to that one, and so on until all accounts are paid off. So the target of $1k application changes month to month.

Does such a method exist, is it any more financially (forget morale) advantaged over avalanche, is there an online calculator so I can see how much better (or worse) this method is vs the others? I've been all over the place but unfortunately avalanche and snowball are so dominant/prominent that I can't find anything other than those two. I can breakdown this method very manually in a spreadsheet to get my answers but it's going to take a while because I'm not 100% sure how to do it easily in Excel and I don't want to [spend more time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [developing](https://xkcd.com/1319/) the calculator than [doing the manual calculation](https://xkcd.com/1445/). So I'm leaning on the hive mind of Reddit to seek the enlightenment I desire.

Thanks all!

P.S. Yes, I know that's a lot of credit cards. Some were my wife's before we were together, some are mine, and we also have one we opened jointly. It's not relevant as to how/why they got this high, but I've been **trying** to pay these down for a long time and it seems I'm finally at a point I am able and I'll just leave it at that.

.

.

.


**EDIT**: Now with 100% more math! Okay, so numbers don't lie. Avalanche continues to be the numbers king. But it never hurts to ask the questions or we'll never find anyway to do things better.

For those curious (using my actual numbers) over the course of 12 months (because soon after accounts began getting to 0 balances and the calculations became slightly more complex) my proposed method paid out a total of $4919.65 in interest vs. Avalanche paid out $4367.63.

We put down $2500 and paid an additional $850 for inspections, so we are in it for $3350 and our realtor said we could walk away at any point if we are willing to lose our earnest money.

We have been living in a 1400 sqft home for 5 years that we have outgrown since our kiddo was born.  We paid $249k for it, owe about $180k, and in the pre-corona market, we would probably sell for about $300k since it is a newer home in a great part of town.  Homes in our area are still selling, but our new home won't be available until late July, and who knows what will happen between now and then.

Our prospective new home is priced at $344k, and we have 20% down (\~$66k), and were planning on using equity from current home and doing a recast after our current home sells, meaning we would have an additional $80-90k \[ideally\] to put towards principal (approximately 42% down).  We are approved at 3.5% interest rate, and can buy down the rate as low as 2.75% with an additional \~$10k at closing.  

For what it is worth, we plan to stay in this house for a very long time -- possibly as long as to see our little one off to college.

I have a number of reservations about this whole process.

1. We are buying into a market at the inflated home price from last fall, and that may (will?) not last
2. We will need to sell our existing home, and might not be able to sell for what we want/need
3. Our jobs are both stable, but that could change at any given time given the uncertainty of covid

What say you reddit?  Are we crazy to buy a house right now?  Should we wait?  There is a lot of conflicting information online, and my major concern is us losing a lot of cash for equity if the price of homes fall.","Crazy to purchase house right now?My wife and I signed and put down earnest money to build a larger new house last November (2019).

t3_gj0fu4,personalfinance,Potential Debt Collection Scam?,"I recently started receiving a call from a ""CMI Group"" that is apparently some sort of debt collector.  They have called multiple times, each time refusing to provide me any information unless I provide them the last four of my social or my address (which I won't give them). When I push for information about the supposed debt, they just end up stating that I will receive something in the mail and then hang up. It's been over a week since they started calling and I have no received anything in the mail.

This organization looks to be based in Texas but are calling from an area code (multiple different numbers as I started to block them) associated with an area I haven't lived in for +10 years (I am in a completely different state now), although I have retained my phone number with that old area code.

I pulled all three of my credit reports and there is nothing on any of them about collections, or anything adverse for that matter. None of my accounts have ever been late and I have never carried any sort of loan/credit card debt outside of my car loan which was paid off early.  I do see though that ""**CREDIT MANAGEMENT LP""** made a soft inquiry prior to the calls starting.

I have been racking my brain trying to determine what debt I may have but I cant think of anything.  If there is a legitimate debt, I completely onboard for settling it......this just has a sketchy feeling so far.

Is there anything I can do to figure out what debt I may have without providing them personal details? I also wasn't sure if this was a scam, or possibly a legit debt associated with mistaken/stoled identify.

My work has short term disability that pays 60% and I will choose to pay for it myself so that taxes are not removed from it. My gross weekly is $1350 so I would think the 60% would come to $800 per week on Short Term Disability. Right?? 

My work offers 12 weeks under FMLA, additionally they offer 3 weeks of 100% pay so I can take a total of 15 weeks off. 

Is there anything else I should be thinking of!?!? Are there loops I need to be aware of for pregnancy care or labor/delivery costs? I really hate getting surprised by medical bills so want to prep as much as possible.

t3_gizohr,personalfinance,NYC management company trying to strong arm me into accepting lease terms,"Hoping anyone might have some insight for courses of action for me on this one. I rent an apartment in NYC, have been with this management company for 3 years, and in this unit for 2. I have always paid my rent on time, if not early, and my credit score has just recently crossed into the excellent range, which feels good. My lease is up June 1, and I received my renewal end of March, you know, right when a certain virus hit New York kind of hard. Thankfully, due to my career being a pretty in-demand profession and essential work (I'm a veterinarian and people love their pets), I am still working and don't have any real fear of job loss or insecurity. However, my annual raise will likely be minimal, if it will happen at all, so my wages will likely be stagnant, which I'm sure is the case for many workers right now fortunate enough to still be employed. Nevertheless, the management company proposed a rent increase of about $100 a month, which, in a normal year would be annoying but tolerable with increased wages, and would correspond with inflation I suppose. But this is not a normal year. I have tried to reach out to the management company about 6 times at this point to re-think this rent increase and have been met with absolute silence - my emails and calls go unanswered, and when I reached out to the leasing office, all they did was send me right back to the renting office who have failed to answer me. When I asked the leasing office for a different email address because that one is not answering me, they also stopped answering my emails.

At this point I feel stuck and a little nervous. I don't want to have no lease and be at risk of eviction, but I also know I am an excellent tenant and don't want to be strong armed into paying what isn't really fair given the drastically changed economic landscape of the city, and the world. I don't know what to do and was actually wondering if I should send back the leasing agreement unsigned with a message to reconsider? I don't even know if I have any rights here. Can anyone offer any advice?

I have always paid my rent on time, if not early, and my credit score has just recently crossed into the excellent range, which feels good. My lease is up June 1, and I received my renewal end of March, you know, right when a certain virus hit New York kind of hard. Thankfully, due to my career being a pretty in-demand profession and essential work (I'm a veterinarian and people love their pets), I am still working and don't have any real fear of job loss or insecurity. However, my annual raise will likely be minimal, if it will happen at all, so my wages will likely be stagnant, which I'm sure is the case for many workers right now fortunate enough to still be employed. Nevertheless, the management company proposed a rent increase of about $100 a month, which, in a normal year would be annoying but tolerable with increased wages, and would correspond with inflation I suppose. But this is not a normal year. I have tried to reach out to the management company about 6 times at this point to re-think this rent increase and have been met with absolute silence - my emails and calls go unanswered, and when I reached out to the leasing office, all they did was send me right back to the renting office who have failed to answer me. When I asked the leasing office for a different email address because that one is not answering me, they also stopped answering my emails.

At this point I feel stuck and a little nervous. I don't want to have no lease and be at risk of eviction, but I also know I am an excellent tenant and don't want to be strong armed into paying what isn't really fair given the drastically changed economic landscape of the city, and the world. I don't know what to do and was actually wondering if I should send back the leasing agreement unsigned with a message to reconsider? I don't even know if I have any rights here. Can anyone offer any advice?

Thanks Reddit.

t3_gizl84,personalfinance,Moving jobs to the VA in my area,"Hello. I have a question regarding working at the VA. I currently work in healthcare--in a private hospital. Due to being bought out by a larger hospital and Covid-19, I started seeking employment elsewhere, since I am afraid I may be laid off. I have been with my current employer for 7 years. In this time, I have gotten 1 raise and it does not look like any are forthcoming in the foreseeable future. Possible future employer (VA) has offered me a salary of about 6k more than where I work now. However, it is at the bottom tier (9 step 1). Therefore  I would make the same as someone fresh out of school. Their health insurance is also about 4k more than what I pay now. I believe I would like to take this job, but am wondering if I have any leg to stand on in asking for an increased salary. Or is my previous experience (7 years) not long enough to be considered? I have not accepted at this time but they are asking for an answer by tomorrow. Thank you so much for any advice!","Moving jobs to the VA in my areaHello.

t3_giz6t6,personalfinance,Partner buying me out of mortgage. How much would I get? (UK),"My partner and I own a house together. I think we will be separating in the coming months and I'm hoping she would opt to buy me out. We initially bought the house for £45k, taking out a £40k mortgage.

We haven't done out the garden yet so the 15k is just sat in a bank account at the moment.

So what would I get if she were to buy me out? Would it be half the 15k, plus half the 10k difference between the mortgage of 65k and the actual remaining value of the house of 75k?

t3_giz46l,personalfinance,Credit Score Help,"I've come to this subreddit looking for help, guidance, and/or a better understanding of credit and my current FICO score.

&amp;#x200B;

I regularly monitor my FICO score through my bank's website. Over the last month, it dropped 19 points and I'm trying to understand why. My bank doesn't offer any guidance other than a phone number to call Experian, which does not seem to have a path to an actual human. I've considered ordering/accessing a report, but I honestly don't know/understand if/how this would affect my score.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I expected that, if anything, my credit score would have gone up. I haven't had a late payment on anything in years. I haven't recently opened nor applied for any new lines of credit. The only things that have changed is that I paid the last payment on my auto loan last month and did not pay on my student loans (so far, for one month) as a result of the CARES Act. I verified that no student loan payment was showing as due before that date came and went. I wouldn't have thought that either of these would bring my credit score down.

t3_giz2bd,personalfinance,Parents paying minimum on private student loans--not sure how much to put towards them,"Basically title. I make right at 100k/year gross right now, pay 2k in rent each month, and have approximately 45k in student loans. Half is a private loan with a \~5.5% interest rate, the other half are a smattering of federal loans ranging from 3.5% to 4.5%.

Right now I am maxing my Roth IRA and putting 10% into my Roth 401k. I pay slightly above the minimum payment on the federal loans (currently funneling it into my emergency fund during COVID forbearance and will be applying all of it towards the federal loans at the end of the forbearance period).

My parents make the minimum monthly payment on the private loans, about $230 per month. I am fully responsible for the federal loans.

With the economy so uncertain, my general dislike of being in debt, and given the fact that I (currently) don't anticipate being laid off, I am considering halting IRA contribs, lowering my 401k contribs to the employer match, and avalanching all of that money into the private loans until they're gone, and then the federal loans. I still put about 1k/month away in my savings account for short term goals (a car and a pilot's license).

Is this a good idea? I'm hesitant to spend so much money paying off the private loans since my parents will *theoretically* pay them until they're gone, and I could use that money for other things (like retirement, as I have been doing), but I have no way of knowing that for certain. Any advice about what to do would be appreciated.

The IRA and Solo 401(K) are Roth; the account through work (essentially a 401(K)) is not. 

Previous posts indicate that you'd want to put the stuff projected to grow more (i.e. stocks) in Roth and stuff projected to grow less (i.e. bonds) in traditional. I guess I'm still a bit confused on whether the allocation across the accounts actually matters in the here-and-now. Since all accounts are growing tax-free and I can freely rebalance across them before the Traditional gets taxed on withdrawal, I feel like I should be allocating them by choosing the few things in my Traditional work 401(K) that have low expense ratios and then making up the rest of the allocation in my Roth.

Curious what I am missing here, since it feels like I am missing *something*. Thanks for any insight!","Does asset allocation across Roth/non-Roth accounts matter during growth phase?Hi all.

t3_giynxd,personalfinance,Advice about taking a new job and having to owe relocation back on my current one,"So I’m in a bit of a situation. I’m 24 years old and I just relocated on a $7,000 relocation package with my current company about two months ago which states I have to be in the role for two years, and that it’s prorated on a daily basis so I would end up owing around $6k still if I left this month. The job I have now is not what I expected, but I’m managing. I’m out here in the new town completely alone, which has taken a toll on my mental health. Again, I’m managing, but I feel like I’m just trying to keep my head above water. I’ve been with this company for almost four years, worked my way up into a management role and went from making about 25k to 66k a year and have a decent amount of stocks. I feel like I owe them, for helping me get this far, so I have a lot of guilt over leaving. 

The new company wants to offer me a $4.5k relocation package to move back to my home town, as well as $5.5k in stocks every year and a $10.8-13.9k annual bonus. My base salary would be $68k but my total compensation would be $89k, while my current role is only $74k. The new job is within the same line of business (customer fulfillment) however, I would be doing QA management and have a significantly smaller team and more ability to work on my own personal growth. This week, I also get about $5k in stocks from my current company that I could use to offset the relo I’m going to have to pay back. I don’t have much in savings, about $7k because I still have student loans and minor CC debt, but that is also an option. 

Ultimately, with my current company I thought transitioning into a new role would help me feel a little less burnt out, yet I still do. My current company is huge, and gets a lot of bad media, so the culture has gotten very bad in many areas. 

Not exactly sure what the best move is - I think I would be much happier in a QA role and moving back to be near my family and friends but it comes at a price. I also am extremely scared to tell my current manager about the new job (if I take it) because I’m afraid it looks so bad that I came here for only two months before leaving. But what I’m doing now is not something I’m passionate about. Since this has been my only long term job, I’m hesitant to make this decision quickly, but I have to let the other company know my decision soon. Can anyone give me some guidance? Have you ever had to pay back relo? If so what was it like? Would I be making a bad decision moving back? I can’t imagine being with my current company for another two years.

t3_giydso,personalfinance,Forced to quit due to losing child care.,"I started a new job in January and all was going well. My wife and I have a 1.5 year old son who was being cared for by our sister-in-law. When COVID hit, Michigan shut down on 3/13 and I had been off work until this past Monday, 5/11. When I told my sister-in-law that I was going back to work (had one weeks notice) she was reluctant but said things have to get back to normal at some point. Well, the next day something changed and she told us she is no longer able to watch our son. We have scrambled to find child care but every place we have called in our area have zero openings and won't for months. So now for the finance part of it all. 

My wife has a very secure job and after going over our budget, accounting for every dime we spend on mortgage, student loan, utilities, Netflix and others, groceries, phone, and gas, we will have about $850 left every month. This is a big change in our monthly savings, which with my income is roughly $4,000/month. My question is, is $850/month a viable amount to live off of? We have very little debt, just our mortgage and my wife's student loan. We have a large enough safety net that would cover our mortgage payment for almost 2 years. We are just freaking out a little and are looking for some reassurance that $850/month will be enough.","Forced to quit due to losing child care.I started a new job in January and all was going well.

t3_giy5li,personalfinance,Affording a Lawyer,"A while ago, I posted in here about some property that I inherited through a trust, and how I want out of it. I hired a lawyer and paid him to get more information about my options, and he did a great job, but in order to proceed he wants $4000 for him to be put on retainer for 10 hours of work. 

My goal is to sell my shares of the company that was made around the trust, which I estimate are worth about 150k to 200k. Obviously $4000 is nothing compared to the potential results of this situation, and considering all of the facts it seems like at the end of it all I will walk away with way more than I am spending. However, I don't have $4000, and the payment plan offered by the lawyer really maxes out my budget. Essentially all of my money that isn't going to rent or bills will go to this for the next four months. In theory, it could go beyond the 10 hours of work that I would pay him for, and I could also in theory continue to pay him, however I don't really have an emergency fund that I can tap into if something goes awry in any other parts of my life (got dicked on taxes, which screwed up my e-fund).

///BREAK///

My husband and I have a 30-year VA mortgage with an interest rate of 3.75%. We’re considering refinancing through a VA “Streamline” or IIRL but aren’t sure whether or not it’s worth it because while we aren’t looking to move any time soon, this house isn’t our “forever home.” 

We called around for quotes and the best we received was from our current lender, who offered a 30-year rate of 2.825% with a monthly savings of $661, which we would immediately then re-apply to our monthly payment as principal, essentially keeping our monthly payment the same, but paying off the loan slightly earlier, and reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by about $184K. All we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5K, so we’d break even within the first year.   

It seems like all of this makes sense, and we’ve been with this lender for 8 years now with absolutely no issues, but are there additional questions we should be asking that might change our decision?","House Refinance Question - Need GuidanceHey everyone, my wife posted the below yesterday.

t3_giwo64,personalfinance,Emergency account setup,"Hi,
I’m a 24 y/o working male.

Every month I split my net income in the following way:
- Acorns account (emergency) = 15%
- Schwab Investment account (investment and growth) = 15%
- Personal Bank account 1 (savings) = 50%
- Personal Bank account 2 (spending/checking) = 20%

I’ve been trying this for my first 15-16 months of employment and everything is going well. But I can’t help but think I could be more efficient with what I’m doing. 


Specifically, my emergency account is set up as an acorns account (aggressive), with an amount equal to 3.5 my monthly spending.

1) Should I keep building my emergency account up?
2) Would I be better off converting the acorns emergency account into a schwab account with some really nice dividend paying and stable etfs (VOO, SCHD, VIG, JST)

t3_givsng,personalfinance,How would you split this rent?,"Hi, I'm speaking to some potential roommates and we have a disagreement on how rent should be split. Here is our situation: the apartment would be a 2B2B, with one room being a double, the other a triple, and someone taking the entire living space (not including kitchen area and small dining table). I would say that each room and the outside living/kitchen space are about the same size. Here's the thing, the bathrooms are located inside each of the bathrooms, so the person in the living room will have to walk back and forth of the double to use that bathroom. Additionally, they will store half their things in the double as well. Question might be why doesn't this person just move into the double? Well, if there's a space for someone to sleep peacefully by themselves, why not use it?

So I tried looking at how to calculate square feet, or using the bidding method website but I just can't get anything to work reasonably. If we were to say that rent was 4000/month, how would you guys divide this? Thanks in advance.

I don’t feel like I’m struggling to save and I currently have more money than ever in my current account. 

However, I just can’t spend it. I really want to go on trips out, road trips, out for a meal, etc. But I hate it.

t3_giu3bk,personalfinance,I have the option to claim or not claim state tax.

t3_girvcq,personalfinance,"My dad passed away. No insurance, CC debt and IRS implications. Need advice.","Need to use a throwaway account for this.

My dad passed away over 3 weeks ago. He was self employed, and had no health or life insurance. Hospital bills are pouring in, upwards of $40k (so far.) He left behind about $50k in credit card debt and my mom charged the funeral ($10k) to a card as well. They own a home with $9k left on the mortgage and it’s worth about $180k. My dad worked his entire life, literally up until the day he died; I don’t want his debtors taking the home he worked so hard for. 

We’ve started claims with the credit card companies, still waiting to hear back from them. My mom was an authorized user on all of them.

We have spoken to the hospitals about bill reduction. One of the things they want is either the last tax return, or a letter from the IRS, claiming no taxes filed. Here’s the kicker...

My dad never filed any taxes. Ever. We moved to the US in 1990 from England. 30 years of working under the table. I don’t know how this happened, or how he got away with it. Most likely it’s because he never made much money. Enough to pay the bills, put me through college, and travel to Ireland/England a couple times a year to visit family. His work (house painter) really slowed down over the last few years, thus the massive credit card debt. 

I’m in a little over my head now. My aunt is helping by reaching out to lawyers and accountants. The accountant worries that if we request these non-filer documents, we could be opening a can of worms with the IRS. But he also said the probate process might open them up anyway. 

My mom is super worried she is going to lose the house. We would like to be able to sell it so she has money to pay off the credit cards and have some money to be able to live off of (most likely with me.)

Any advice here is welcomed. Is bankruptcy an option? Would the IRS care that much about a self employed painter making anywhere from $25k-$75k a year over the last 30 years?","My dad passed away. No insurance, CC debt and IRS implications. Need advice.Need to use a throwaway account for this.

should we superfund with all of this money or keep half of it liquid to add to our real estate investments this year or to contribute to non 401k stock investments?

I haven’t heard of anyone doing this, is it a bad plan to split up the accounts like this?) 

I know it’s bad to try to time the market but it’s just so tempting to sit on this money in a 1.5% annual yield savings account for 3 months in case the market tanks further.

t3_gisp6l,personalfinance,"Just started new job, employer overpaid me","Hey All,

So I just started a new job on a part time contract. I've only had a few pay runs (less than 5) and the pay amount has been the same each time; a fairly modest amount.

I got an email today saying that I've been overpaid (allegedly) by around $200 a fortnight. By my own calculations I am getting the right amount.

I've sent my accountant an email to double check what my pay per week should be, but is it usual to have to pay back my employer if I have been overpaid?

Don't want to start out on the wrong foot, be ripped off or be punished for a mistake that wasn't mine. Unsure how to proceed.

I recently started my career as a nurse and the hospital that I’m working at offers different health insurance plans. However, I’m not very knowledgeable about much regarding finances/insurance since I have very recently just started “adulting” so I was wondering if I could get some insight.

t3_gishpp,personalfinance,Roth IRA 2019 Contributions,"Hi everyone!

I am a 22 year old college student. I initially opened my Roth IRA with Vanguard in September of 2019, and contributed $3000. After a few months with them, I decided to transfer my Roth IRA to M1 Finance, as I didn't enjoy the interface with Vanguard. I thought I liked the M1 Finance interface, as I was using them for my individual brokerage account for a few weeks prior to transferring. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that M1 Finance was not the broker I wanted to hold my Roth IRA with. I was trying to transfer my Roth IRA from M1 to Charles Schwab, but M1 was giving me a big headache and not a clear answer. This eventually lead me to liquidating my account, and transferring the money into my bank. I am now with Charles Schwab and have contributed another $3000 for the 2019 year. From my understanding, since I took out the money from my M1 Finance account, I cannot contribute another $3000 to the 2019 year. Is this correct? And if so, is there anything I can do since I feel like I was mislead at the time with M1 Finance.

September of 2018 I got my first car from a dealer (and thus first car payment). I had pretty crappy credit as I was going through nursing school and supporting myself at the age of 18. No excuse but it led me to my current loan of 60 months with a 22.62% APR owing 10085 on the price of the car. Total cost I owe in the end is 17212.
Flash forward to now and I am much better off financially. My bills are minimal, and I just took a crisis job helping with Covid-19 in NJ. I have payed off quite a bit on the car and only owe 6200 left. I have the ability to completely pay off my car at the end of this month but I am wondering if I should? Or should I refinance? My thought on refinancing would be to get the cost of my car down to around 1500 and then refinance to make my payments lower and then basically just pay monthly until I wanted to payoff my car and own it. I would do this to keep the loan on my credit to extend my credit age. It’s currently at 2 years 10 months and I don’t just wanna close stuff willy-nilly. My only other contributions to my credit score are my student loans and one credit card I pay off monthly. I understand if I refinance I may have to pay more in the end, but if I’m correct about it boosting my score I just look at the extra money as an investment into my financial wealth. Is this silly and I should just buy off my car when I can? Will this help at all?? Thanks for any advice!!","Should I refinance my car?Hi y’all!

I will be graduating with a degree in Biology. I am eventually going to Medical School, but I want to take some time off to pay down my student loans and to get my feet on the ground. In the meantime, I hope to get a job doing medical device sales, or something of that nature.

I currently have 40k in student loan debt. I am already working on paying it back while I am still in school so I can get ahead. By the time I graduate, I will probably have paid it down to 30k, maybe even less. (I have a full time job, and I have a side hustle in which the money goes directly to my loans).

I know it may seem irresponsible to move somewhere so expensive while I have such a high amount of debt (I currently live in Arkansas where the cost of living is much lower) but it has been a dream of mine to live in California for as long as I can remember. I want to do it while I’m young and free with few responsibilities.

Of course, I wouldn’t move there until I got a job. But I still need money prior to moving. I would greatly appreciate financial planning advice for this move. My focus is my debt right now, but how much should I be putting aside for next year? 

I’d also just appreciate any of your own experiences or advice! 

Side note, I’ll probably live there alone for a year... id probably try to find some sort of roommate to lower cost?

t3_gis0mc,personalfinance,Trying to start planning my finances and feeling overwhelmed,"I work as a teacher and my wife works as a nurse. We have stable careers and a combined take home of around 150k.

We had an opportunity at age 24 (her 25) to buy a home, so we spent the money we saved for a wedding on the downpayment and remodel of our home. We were a bit over our heads with it, not financially, but more in terms of being homeowners. It was a great deal on the smallest house in an amazing neighborhood that has doubled in value since we bought it.

However, because of the amount of remodeling we had to do to it, we've just spent a lot of money on short term 0% loans to cover things like appliances, floors, and other remodeling things.

Now, four years later, we are in a position where our budget is very stable after several years of salary growth with very little debt. I'm looking to refinance my home and start saving for retirement, while not affecting our short terms saving goals (as we still need around 60k in remodeling to ""finish"" the house entirely).

29 has kind of snuck up on me, and I know I should've invested earlier than now, but I want to get started.

1. Refinancing my home.

My current home loan was originally 198k at 4.25% fixed, and the current principal is at 182. I talked to quicken loans and their offer estimate for a 15 year was 2.875% but they are looking to add 12k to my note in closing costs. 5400 for an escrow account and 6600 for their closing fees and whatever points they are paying down, which is unclear to me as of yet. It feels like I shouldn't need escrow and the closing costs seem very high as well. I should definitely shop around for this, right? 


I'm not sure I want to throw 12k paying those up front, but at the same time the escrow account from my current mortgage should cover the 5400 for the new escrow (I did check the balance), but that still leaves their 6600 fees. The paperwork estimate he sent was for the 30 year (I was exploring both options) and says 2pts paid down and 1600 in fees, with an interest rate on the 30 year of 3.375. Seems like I should have a better interest rate than that at this point. The original loan was with 10% down, a much higher debt to incom ratio, much worse credit, and much worse rates at the time (Feb 2016). Now we both have 800+ credit scores and they are offering me 3.875 as my interest rate before I pay it down? That seems like I'm being ripped off, but again I know nothing.

2. Setting up my retirement.

My dad says RothIRA. I think my wife and I are pretty capped at our current levels of income. She won't be making much more in her current position, I probably won't be breaking 70k any time soon. Is a RothIRA the right choice for us? 

Should I dump the 6k max for the year in right now for both of us, while the market is at a low, or stick to 1000$ a month this year and go to 500$ a month next year? Does that even matter? 

Are there any better investment options for my situation?


The only other debt we have currently is our car payment of 400 a month.

The original loan was with 10% down, a much higher debt to incom ratio, much worse credit, and much worse rates at the time (Feb 2016). Now we both have 800+ credit scores and they are offering me 3.875 as my interest rate before I pay it down? That seems like I'm being ripped off, but again I know nothing.

2. Setting up my retirement.

My dad says RothIRA. I think my wife and I are pretty capped at our current levels of income. She won't be making much more in her current position, I probably won't be breaking 70k any time soon. Is a RothIRA the right choice for us? 

Should I dump the 6k max for the year in right now for both of us, while the market is at a low, or stick to 1000$ a month this year and go to 500$ a month next year? Does that even matter? 

Are there any better investment options for my situation?


The only other debt we have currently is our car payment of 400 a month.

t3_girpcq,personalfinance,Need Advice on Best Way to Pay Off Student Loans Currently?,"I currently have federal student loans and due to the COVID situation the government has put a pause on interest and payments until end of September. I am currently working and can afford to continue paying my loans.

t3_girjgp,personalfinance,Tax Impact on ROTH/Traditional IRA Contribution,"Hey guys! First post here because I'm hoping a better understanding of this can help me in future years to make the best decision for myself and my family. My wife and I, both in our mid-20's, just got married in October and both make over $10,000 a year (important later, I promise). Since this is our first time filing taxes as a couple, I tried to see what our returns would be filing separately vs jointly. Turns out we would have gotten an extra $600 back filing separately, mostly in state tax return. Or so I thought until I added in my ROTH IRA contributions. For whatever weird reason, married filing separately has an income cap of $10,000 in order to contribute to a ROTH without a 6% penalty, enforced every year until the money is removed from the account?? And even if you contribute to a traditional, it may end up not be tax-deductible? What is this about? Outside of preventing couples in similar situations from filing separately to increase their tax return, what is the point of this? For context, married filing jointly and filing as single both have income caps in excess of $100,000 for ROTH IRA contributions.

Long story short (TL;DR?): Why is the income cap for ROTH IRA contributions when married filing separately so low as compared to other forms of filing?","Tax Impact on ROTH/Traditional IRA ContributionHey guys!

t3_girfov,personalfinance,Am I eligible for unemployment?,"Throwaway b/c personal information. 
My significant other and I were living and working in our college city after we graduated, but we are from the same hometown/city. I in particular missed my family, and we were planning on moving back eventually to be closer to them. Back in March he got a dream job offer in our hometown, which he accepted. So, eventually suddenly became now. I applied for jobs, and within a few weeks I got an offer which I accepted. Due to timing, I had to put in my two weeks at the job I was currently working immediately, and they quickly starting training a new hire to replace me. This hiring process for me was happening at the end of March, and I was supposed to start my new job in mid April (literally finishing at my old job on a Friday and starting the new one on a Monday). Well, COVID happened and a week before my start date they pushed my start date back to June for “protecting our staff etc” reasons, though I suspected it was monetary. I immediately started searching for other jobs in the area, and got another interview lined up with a different company. I had two interviews for two different positions, and they didn’t pan out. So here I am mid-May unemployed and uninsured. I strongly suspect I will be getting a call in the next two weeks informing me that my June start is no longer happening. 

Since I left my old job voluntarily, is there any chance am I eligible for unemployment? I live in Texas for reference. I really thought I would easily be able to find another job, but I clearly underestimated the impact of COVID. I have continued applying for jobs every week over the past few weeks with no luck, and it doesn’t help that I am lacking in experience as I only graduated last May. There are a few reasons I don’t think I can return to my old job 1. They have already hired a replacement for me 2. While my manager and supervisor were very understanding of my leaving, I technically broke a contract by leaving the company, and if I was to show interest in being re-hired I may get blocked by HR, in addition to the possibly of HR realizing that I technically owe said company a couple thousand dollars for leaving in the first place 3. I honestly don’t see anything other than me becoming severely depressed if I were to move back to that city alone, as I have literally no one there.

t3_gire43,personalfinance,Buying a house with some visible termite damage - without termite bond,"I'm curious if anyone as run into this problem regarding buying real estate without a termite bond. We put in an offer on a house we love and accepted their counter. Inspection revealed a small part of the exterior brick that had a termite mound. There were live termites in it. On the other side of the wall, there was termite damage to the window and baseboard perpendicular to the live termites outside. No live termites were seen inside, but the damage was done. Upon asking, there was no termite bond in place since the owners bought the house in 2014. It was built in 2001.

I'm wondering what course of action we should take. We're inclined to simply ask for a reduction of the purchase price, but don't know the full extent of the damage. Realistically, for full peace of mind, we would tear down a whole wall worth of sheetrock to insure the damage isn't extensive. Other than that, though, the report brought back a very clean record of this house.","Buying a house with some visible termite damage - without termite bondI'm curious if anyone as run into this problem regarding buying real estate without a termite bond.

t3_giraso,personalfinance,Can I negotiate salary package for a new position at the same company?,"Very long story short - I was promised a promotion at my current company, on my current team, in my current role back in February. Was told “all the executive approvals” required were signed/sealed/delivered. Then nothing for weeks.  I’d consistently followed up when all of a sudden I saw an open job positing at my company- for the same position I would have been promoted to. 

My bosses have assured me I’m not losing my current role but they also encouraged me to apply for the role as an internal candidate to “prove I’m willing to compete against anyone for a promotion” and because in light of COVID they aren’t sure the promotion I’ve already been approved for “will go through” (???) I think that’s messed up, but I have applied and so far moved steadily through the interview process with my current bosses. 

My question is - aside from how duplicitous and bogus this situation is - if I get the job, what are some ways I negotiate the salary package in my favor? I already know I’m being paid under what others in my company are for similar work (hence pushing for a promotion to begin with).

t3_gir54a,personalfinance,Getting ready to move out and want to set up budget,"I finally decided it is time to move out. Or at least, finally time to start planning to move out. Ideally I want to move out in 2 years after I receive my diploma and have all of my debt, minus student loans and car, paid off. But I'm seeing differences on how much should be budgeted for housing (25% vs 30% and gross vs net income). 

I live in Northern Virginia and work as a leasing agent, so I am familiar with apartments. Initially I stayed with my job because we get 20% off rent, but now I don't like our properties as much. Also I might leave the field and go work related to my degree. 

It will be for my friend and me so we will need a 2 BR. I'm looking at rent and it's about $1900+ for 2 BR. I see apartments that are cheaper but they're in sketchy areas. I currently live by an elementary school and this area is considered to be good, but we've had 2 shootings in less than a half a year. I want to live somewhere where I feel safe (I know safety can't be guaranteed but it's 2 girls so we want assurance) and is peaceful. We could move south, but with traffic what we save in rent will be spent in gas plus time in traffic.

t3_gir3ma,personalfinance,Should I buy a house with my current income?,"So I'm 31 and make about $40,000 a year before taxes. After taxes, medical, 401k contributions, etc, I take home about $2100 a month. 

Currently I rent, which is $700 a month and includes all utilities. I have no debt whatsoever and my car is fully paid off.

Right now I'm looking at buying my first house which is proving to be rather intimidating. I have $10,000 saved up at the moment and the houses i'm looking at are in the $75,000 to $85,000 range. My credit score is 781 so I don't think getting a loan would be a problem. 

Anyway, for what I pay in rent, it would be cheaper on a month to month basis to own a home. On top of that, I would be moving to a 3 bedroom home up from a studio which would be a huge quality of life improvement. That and not having to hear noisy neighbors all the time.

Does now seem like a good time to buy? Or should I wait until I save more/make more? 

My main concerns are just not having a large savings before buying. If I do buy, should I use all $10,000 for a down payment? I know it's recommended to have 20% of the homes value for a down payment. Would I be able to use my mortgage for upfront costs at the time of purchase such as closing costs and initial moving expenses?

I was hoping to be able to do an internship this summer so I wouldn't have to take more loans out, but then COVID-19 hit. So I will need about 4k per semester to cover the remaining costs, hopefully less once things open up again and I can find a job. At the end of my final year, my total will be something like 25k Federal Unsubsidized, and 16k other, for a total of ~41k. I have had a credit card for a while, and my credit score (according to the report provided by Discover) is 739. I haven't checked yet, but I suspect my mother's credit score is lower than mine.

Would I be able to get a better rate with parent plus loans or private loans, considering that I have a decent credit score? And what student loan servicers should I look into? I am a member of NASA Federal Credit Union, would I get a better rate there vs a big servicer?

- 25 years old, 85k salary (and increasing), California

- I have a 150k down payment

- Looking to buy a ~700k-750k house 

With my down payment, a house in the 700-750k range is 22% down payment. 

Zillow says houses at these prices with that down payment come down to $3,300-$3,500 a month. After taxes, retirement, etc, my paycheck comes out to about $4,500 a month.

I plan to rent out a room in my house when I move in to help with extra income. Let's say I rent a room in the house to someone for $1,700 a month.

$4,500+$1,700-$3500 leaves me with $2,700 left over from my actual paycheck of $4,500. That would technically mean I pay 40% for housing, a little over the general guideline of 33%, but it makes sense knowing I live in California.

Would a mortgage lender give me the extra $550,000 after my down payment to buy that house knowing I will be renting out a room? Is there a special rule or different type of application I have to fill out for renting?

I know there's another guideline that says not to buy a house over 3x your annual income, but I don't feel like that applies to me since I have a hefty downpayment and I'm willing to rent the house out as well.","Will a mortgage lender give me this amount of money for a house?Relevant information:

t3_giqk1n,personalfinance,Balance Transfer Card Payment Strategy Before Personal Loan,"I've got 3 balance transfer cards right now, all at high utilization (detailed below). I intend to take out a personal loan in the next few months (August probably) to pay these off, and I was wondering what the best strategy would be for paying these down in the meantime to get the best rate on the personal loan. Credit Karma lists my score as 680 if that matters here, and I have a number of other cards at 0 utilization.

Card 1 - $5,000 balance on $7,500 limit, just ended 0% APR and is now 13.99%  
Card 2 - $3,200 balance on $4,000 limit, 0% APR until August  
Card 3 - $6,200 balance on $8,500 limit 0% APR until August

I currently have roughly $1,500 budgeted per month to put towards paying these down. In terms of credit score and rate on a personal loan, would the best option here be to:  
1 - pay these down ""equally"", trying to reduce utilization on each of them equally  
2 - pay down card 1 as fast as possible and minimums on the others

Or does it matter at all? I recognize that option 1 would result in slightly more interest charged on card 1 for the couple months, but maybe that's offset by an improved interest rate on the other one.

Help!","I was hospitalized for a week in September of 2018.

Considering the cost of healthcare in the US,  these amounts were way higher than my out of pocket maximum pocket maximum, so I ended up paying that much (I believe it was $3500) and all my deductibles, etc. I had some more procedures in November and December, and they were all covered 100% because I had hit that out of pocket maximum.

Fast forward 20 months and I just received a bill for $303.20 from the hospital for my hospitalization in 2018. The bill isn't like any other bill I've gotten from them, because the “adjustments”, “patient payments”, and “amount due” columns are all blank all the way down the bill, and then the last line item is “adjustments and payments” which reads:
Adjustments: -$4362.80
Patient payments: -$200.00
Charges: - $4866.00
Amount due: $303.20

I called the hospital and they said that this bill was generated because my insurance company (blue cross blue shield) had just reprocessed the bill on 05/02/20 and adjusted what they were paying, so I was responsible for the difference that that's why I got the bill.

I already paid my out of pocket maximum in 2018, so how can I be billed more for services that occurred in 2018? If the insurance company is denying to pay the full amount for specific line items, why are the line items “adjustments”, “patient payments”, and “amount due” all blank? I've read online that it isn't uncommon for someone to get a bill a year or so later than a hospitalization, but this is almost two years, which I find completely absurd. I know that debts can still be collected for years (5 years?) but from what I understand this isn't an old debt I owe, it's a new debt due to the hospital or insurance company changing what was paid, which just seems so fishy to me. Like as if I sold you a car 20 months ago and now today I'm changing the price, if that makes sense.

Do I have any recourse in fighting this, or am I just stuck paying out? I've been furloughed at work with no timeline for coming back, so every penny counts right now. I already tried to talk to the hospital about it, and they only help their financial department offered was to set me up with a 12 month payment plan. 

Any advice for how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated!


UPDATE:

Unfortunately I don't have much to update, and I really haven't gotten anywhere with this after 6 hours on the phone with them. I contacted the hospital and they said this bill was generated because Blue Cross denied or updated a claim. I called Blue Cross and they said that wasn't true and they had no idea what the hospital was talking about, and that they have this claim marked as paid and closed on February of 2019. After calling each of them half a dozen times, each one saying the other is either lying or doesn't know what they're talking about, I called them both on a conference call and sat on mute for over two hours while they discussed the bill. None of it made much sense to me and they didn't even seem to know how to talk to each other - The hospital would say ""here is the claim number XXXXXXXX"" and the insurance would say ""That's not a claim number, we don't use letters in our claim numbers, what are you talking about"" and on and on. At this point they have now sent me an itemized bill, but it doesn't have specific line items adding up to the total they claim I owe. They are saying that these charges technically occurred before the date that I hit my OOP maximum, and I argued that if that was the case, shouldn't I be refunded for any payments I made after that date, because as it stands now this payment will put my out of pocket over the maximum. That didn't get me anywhere and they said I should call my bank for all statements from 2018 to verify whether I truly paid my OOP maximum or whether I still owe $303.20 in order to hit that maximum. Blue Cross is physically mailing me an updated EOB and itemized list that they say will clarify all of this, but I don't think it will. I was also told that because this bill is from 20 months ago it is too late to file an appeal or dispute the charges, but I think that's just a lie to keep me from trying to pursue that option. All in all, I'm out 6 hours of phone calls today alone, and I feel like I'm still on the hook for this complete BS bill.

t3_giq1zd,personalfinance,Where to look when refinancing to a 10 year loan?,"Hi guys,

So I've tried a couple companies already in my area , to try and get a general idea of closing costs  / total savings when it comes to refinancing from my current 3.8% (or so) loan to try and get down to about 2.75%.

At first, they got back to me when it was concerning doing 20-30 year loans, but after telling them I'm trying to get down to a 10 year loan to save as much in interest in payments (at the cost of paying higher monthly payments), both of those companies seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth.

Are there certain reputable companies out there to seek when refinancing, or do you guys just search Yelp / Google in hopes of finding a good one? I just don't want to have to put in applications with several companies in the opes of finding the best deal.

I'm using a mortgage calculator and have a close idea of where my goal is in terms of refinancing / closing costs/ savings, but once I ask questions like ""Why is it this calculator, using the same figures, shows I should be saving more than what you're telling me I should save?"" question comes up, that seems to be ending the conversation.

t3_gii3ny,personalfinance,"Have been reading Rich Dad and Poor Dad for over a decade, what lessons have I learned?","Disclaimer- I am not giving advice to you. It is about me talking to myself. If you could help me out by telling me how naive I am and where the plan is wrong and not practical so that I could improve my future self. I NEED YOUR ADVICE.  

 The first time I read this book was when I was in 9th grade. I have never fully understood the concepts presented in this book until I encountered those concepts myself through different life experiences. Obviously, this book is a start. I try to keep it simple. These concepts just keep you on the right path, but how you get there is up to you. Walk, run, fly, crawl. Just finish it. Remember “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.” Having the right mindset is critical. Making money is the next step, but this book does not show how to. It does but vaguely. Well, you need somewhere to start, and this book is a great place to do so. Let's get into it. Robert has two dads. One is poor and the other one is rich. He boiled lessons he learned from two dads down into 6 lessons.

The first lesson is that the rich do not work the money. One quote that got me pondered for so many years when I first read it. “The Poor work for money, while the Rich have the money work for them” What did Robert mean when he said the rich have money work for them? Is it that the rich have some magic turn money into some kind of bus boy and boss them around all day long?. If so, sign me up. I finally understood this concept when I was introduced to stock. Stock is not a piece of paper. There is a business behind it. If I can not optimize my money, let somebody use it and return me with principal plus interest. All I do is have a good night's sleep.

I remembered one of my friends told me that he invested his money in his personal car. He had all the accessories and top of the line car. I laughed at it because I believe a car can never hold its value unless he buys the car, fixes it and sells it for profit. To me, a car is just a tool getting me from point A to point B. That is why it is important to understand the second lesson: the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets are what puts money into your pocket and liabilities are what takes money out of your pocket. Assets are houses, stocks and businesses. What makes you money, not take money away from you.

The third lesson is mind your own business. I prefer to call it that profits are better than wages. You either work for a company, government or the bank. You need to have financial independence. What I mean by financial independence is that you are able to live from your own resources. Thinking about getting fire from your job the next morning. The fourth lesson is taxes. Both rich and poor are trying to earn money. The difference is that the rich spend their earnings before they pay taxes and the poor do the opposite. How do the rich do that?. You have to learn the power of corporations and accounting. This gets me to the fifth lesson: the rich invent money.

The fifth chapter is more like when I close my eyes, I can't see. It divides into 4 subsections- accounting, invest, market and laws. Accounting, you have to understand the numbers so that you could spend your hard earned money before the Fed has their hands on it. This explanation is more abstract and technical. The better way to explain it is to use accounting to keep track of your spending. Otherwise, it is like you eat and have diarrhea at the same time. You need imodium man. The best way to do it is to spend your money with cash instead of a credit card. Next, investing means keep your cash flow. This could be through bonds, stock and real estate. Stocks are easy. If you are an average investor, VOO fund is the way to go. Why? Check out your probability of beating the market. Real estate remembers one rule- Value added or Turning trash into gold. Find a house that needs to be fixed. Buy it, fix it and sell it. For every dollar you put in, you could get 4$ back. Market is full of opportunities. It is all about supply and demand. You gotta keep your eyes open and pay careful attention to what the market demands. These opportunities for you to innovate and fulfill the needs of the market. Golden rule- Ignorance of law is not an excuse for any crimes that you commit. Know the law, at least the basics, understand your rights and think like a lawyer. The reason I got into law is because when I play a board game with my friends, I see that whoever understands the rules of the game the most, wins the game because they are able to manipulate the game into their advantages. This applies to real life too. If watching “Making a murderer” does not make your hand stand straight up while thinking that you could be the one wasted 18 years for intentionally wrongfully convicted, think again. On the other hand, if you would like to get away with murder like O.J, law may be the first tool.

The last lesson is that learning to earn is more important than earning itself.The average student earns 11$ per hour. I earned 19$ per hour working as a Pharmacy Intern. I quit my job to participate in the PSSNY business plan competition. People say that I am stupid because this hospital pharmacy intern is hard to come by. There is a limited number of hospitals compared to chain pharmacies. If I work 20 hours per day, every week of the month, every month of the year, I could earn up to 18,240$ compared to 125$ for winning the competition that took me the whole year to prepare. Why I still pick the competition over the job, if I get to choose it all over again and never regret one bit. I learned how to be a leader and take responsibility and motivate others. I could earn much more in the future.

Theory is just a theory if you can not apply it. There are a lot of obstacles that you have to overcome. They include fear, cynicism, lazy, bad habits and arrogance. Fear is nothing but the suffering itself. Lazy is when you don't have enough reasons to thrive. Bad habit is your nature and hard to overcome unless you understand the mechanism of habit is cue-routine-reward and start to manipulate it. Cynicism is funny because if you die today doing what you love, will dying still be a problem anymore. Arrogance is simply that you need to shut up and listen. Beyond all of this, the first step is a big step. I am lazy to run every day. But I tricked myself. How about I change my clothes and drive my car to the bike trail. If I get there and I still do not change your mind, I could always drive back home and continue to do whatever I am doing at the moment. But it  has never happened that I drive back to my house after getting there. . Well if you make it to here, thank you so much. Comment below. Let me know what you think. I really appreciate it.","Have been reading Rich Dad and Poor Dad for over a decade, what lessons have I learned?Disclaimer- I am not giving advice to you. It is about me talking to myself.

t3_gii3vs,personalfinance,Permanent DEFAULT credit card rates. Why?,"Something I don't quite understand: Back when the CARD act legislation was passed, why didn't they also put in provisions that would prevent credit card issuers from locking their customers into a permanent ""default"" interest rate (usually nearly 30%), rather than requiring them to drop the rate back down over time to the original rate after something like 6 or 9 months of on-time payments and ""good behavior""?

With all the positive changes that legislation produced, it seems that they missed a huge opportunity to prevent CC issuers from endlessly screwing their customers year after year by tricking them with a low rate, then as soon as they accidentally step on any ""late payment landmine"" ... BOOM! ... their default ""loan shark"" rate kicks in for the entire life of that card.

I remember missing a few payments on my Discover card around 18 or 20 years ago after which they immediately locked me into a 28.99% default rate and kept it there for all that time. They refused to lower it after repeated requests, even after almost 2 decades of perfect payments. The only option they offered was to close out my original card and open a brand new ""Discover It"" card, which meant possibly loosing my very long card history length and also paying some huge transfer fee to park my debt onto the new card. Fortunately, my high Discover balance is now $0 and has been for some time, for that very reason. They were simply too greedy when all I wanted them to do was lower my rate just a little. I finally decided to use an installment based loan to get rid of their excessively high interest payments. So rather than robbing me just a little less, they lost the whole shebang. I only keep my original Discover Card active because it is one of my oldest cards and I don't want the hits to my credit score and DTI for closing it right now. But I do wonder why the CARD act didn't simply put a stop to the filthy greedy practice of jacking up rates permanently. To me, it's a bait and switch and a huge overreach for even the smallest ""infraction"". Heck, even a full-blown bankruptcy is forgiven (no longer reported) eventually. Why don't credit cards penalize, then forgive too?","Permanent DEFAULT credit card rates.

The only option they offered was to close out my original card and open a brand new ""Discover It"" card, which meant possibly loosing my very long card history length and also paying some huge transfer fee to park my debt onto the new card. Fortunately, my high Discover balance is now $0 and has been for some time, for that very reason. They were simply too greedy when all I wanted them to do was lower my rate just a little. I finally decided to use an installment based loan to get rid of their excessively high interest payments. So rather than robbing me just a little less, they lost the whole shebang. I only keep my original Discover Card active because it is one of my oldest cards and I don't want the hits to my credit score and DTI for closing it right now. But I do wonder why the CARD act didn't simply put a stop to the filthy greedy practice of jacking up rates permanently. To me, it's a bait and switch and a huge overreach for even the smallest ""infraction"". Heck, even a full-blown bankruptcy is forgiven (no longer reported) eventually. Why don't credit cards penalize, then forgive too?",1,permanent default rate something quite back card act legislation put provision prevent issuer locking customer permanent interest rate usually nearly rather requiring rate back time original rate something month time payment behavior positive change legislation seems huge opportunity prevent cc issuer screwing customer year year tricking low rate soon step late payment boom loan shark rate kick entire life remember missing payment discover year ago rate kept time lower request even almost perfect payment option close original open new discover meant possibly loosing long history length paying huge transfer fee park onto new fortunately high discover balance time reason simply lower rate little finally use installment loan excessively high interest payment rather robbing little le lost whole shebang keep original discover active one hit score dti closing right card act simply put stop filthy practice jacking rate permanently bait switch huge overreach even smallest infraction heck even full blown bankruptcy forgiven longer eventually penalize forgive

t3_gipsap,personalfinance,[US] Do I [mid 20's] get an MBA now?,"TLDR: mid 20's; roughly 9.5 years of experience, non traditional career path. 125k salary currently, 375k net worth, Considering UC Davis MBA for 105k - part time. Is it worth it?

Started in accounting/bookkeeping 

Worked for client in Health Technology.  Worked at firm for 5 years, Got offers at 1 large defense contractor, 1 well known unicorn, and 1 large university. 

Wanted something more ethically rewarding so I joined public sector and became an executive within a short period. Do well with it. I'm well liked and do great work but the public sector is unlikely to yield anywhere close to the promotions I've seen in the past. I'm fast paced and don't want to get bored and I like the idea of having the options to go into other fields in the next 2-3 years. I am looking at the next 40 years of my career and thinking about what I could do at this point and without an MBA my options seem limited. I don't want an MPA, but I'm open to other graduate programs in theory, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush in this case and I'm already in the program...

I enjoy being in the public sector. The WLB and the pay at this level and at my age are good. I'm free to work on my side businesses (consulting and a real estate development) but they are really more hobbies at this point than serious investments.

Looking at UC Davis MBA - Online with the option of switching to part time. Currently work in public sector. Make 125k with great benefits and low chance of layoff amidst COVID 19.

Didn't take the GMAT, didn't really want to yet but noticed that several schools were waiving the GMAT requirement due to COVID. I figured what the heck, and applied to a few low state schools for the ""check box"" and then UC Davis because I was genuinely interested in a better program where I could keep my job while I did it. I've never had any problems academically and am confident I could do an MBA and work.

I did very well at the tech company I was at as well as some other business side dealings and have roughly 300k saved. I also have around 75k in 401k/retirement funds and my partner (28) has 100k in their savings. We live frugally and certainly don't spend all of our income but buy most of what we want. Partner is finishing first degree in December and will likely get a low starting salary out of school (50-60k) after a short break. Neither of us are looking to FIRE as we enjoy working and if we decide in the future it looks more than likely that we will be fine with doing so. We took all of our money out of the market in late February, narrowly missing the crash but not making any capital gains currently. Likely to go back in the market in equity in a few months and real estate.

I got into UC Davis for their online MBA, it costs 105k! yikes. Meanwhile other schools want applicants to take the traditional MBA again. I frankly don't much want to take the GMAT at this point for a few reasons. At the top of the list, if I took the GMAT and scored well (I have done very well on the practice tests) and got into a M7 program. I still don't think I'd go. 2 years at 125k with 3-&gt;5% raises plus my side business income 25k per year in lost income and 120k for school is a whopping $424k. I went to a low rank school for UG that doesn't impress on my resume.

t3_giphog,personalfinance,Cost-Benefits of HSAs and Receipt Reimbursements,"My wife, daughter and I are enrolled in my company's high deductible ($4k family) HSA plan.  We intend to grow our family a bit over the next few years with an obvious range of potential outcomes.  Other than maternity care and trips to the pediatrician, we do not have any regular medical expenses.  Assuming hypothetically, we have 4 kids (all separately) over the next 7 years, we will most likely hit the $4k deductible a minimum of 4 times.  Assuming the other 3 years our medical expenses are &gt;$1k, is an HSA plan still advisable, or would it be better to switch to a regular plan that covers maternity during potential pregnancy years?  Obviously pregnancies can carry over into a new year thereby refreshing the deductible, but the costs generally only start racking up in the third trimester and during labor/delivery.

As an an important caveat, I intend to use my HSA as a retirement vehicle.  I love that it is triple-taxed advantaged and would hate to give it up for a new plan.  At the same time, I want to approach this in the most cost-savy way.

Finally, on a related note, I have a few questions re receipt reimbursement for HSAs:
-Are electronic receipts permissible if they meet the general requirements? (e.g., email receipts)
-Can you combine documents to form one receipt? (e.g., an unpaid bill describing the nature of the service provided combined with a receipt for that bill indicating payment.

Years ago, my ex and I (both in our mid 20’s at the time) needed to decide on future living arrangements. I lived at home with my parents still (with a full-time job) and my ex (he had a full-time job as well) was being forced to move out of his parents house due to them getting divorced. We made ab 60,000 combined (def not a lot for the area we live in) and I had a large chunk of money inherited from my grandmother saved up (ab 30,000). I proposed the following scenario: I would buy a cheap condo (using my inheritance as the down payment) and then my ex would just move in with me and pay rent (equal to half of the mortgage; approx $500). My ex was angry that I suggested this and said something to the effect of, “no way, that’s not fair! What the hell do I get outta that arrangement?”. I didn’t understand what was unfair ab the suggestion; we’d get to live together, he gets cheaper rent payments, plus I’d at least be investing my money into property without having to worry ab any mess if we broke up (he’d get to walk anyway at anytime if things went sour). The person who commented and disagreed with me kept saying that if my ex was paying towards the mortgage, then they have equity in the property but I don’t understand that.... wouldn’t it be the same as any other landlord/renter agreement? Landlords use rent to pay their mortgages all the time, but it doesn’t mean the renter has equity in the property they rent. Was I wrong/inappropriate to suggest this scenario to my ex??

t3_gipghy,personalfinance,Creepy Unauthorized Withdraw/Theft,"Today someone stole money out of my WF account. My online banking info shows that the amount went through by my card being swiped at a 7/11 ATM. But that’s not possible because my card was on my person and I was in another state far away!

No one else has my PIN and I’ve never provided it online, etc. Is it likely that someone I know did this? Creepy to think about... 

After freezing the card, I filed a claim. The Claims rep asked me if I had the pin written down. I said that I did in a safe place in my apartment with other passwords, etc. She said that writing the PIN down was against bank policy and not to do it in the future.

Is this somehow grounds to deny my claim?? The banker transferred my claim info to her and I told her I’ve never been to the state where the ATM is and explained that the card was in my possession and provided her my card number when asked.","Creepy Unauthorized Withdraw/TheftToday someone stole money out of my WF account.

How do I pay this off/find out who owns it?? What steps should I be taking to prepare to pay it? Is there anything I shouldn’t say on the phone when I do get in contact. I can pay it in full if needed but is that required?

t3_gip2vg,personalfinance,"Called collections agency for my Grandma, concerned they might come after me now","Hello everyone, I hope you are all healthy and happy, tldr at bottom

So my grandma had a small debt that went to collections, that she supposedly settled already, from what she tells me. She got a letter from some agency, saying if she paid a certain amount by a certain date, that the debt would be settled. She ended up sending the amount in the mail, and got the post office to stamp something for her proving she sent it on the day she did. Only problem is she sent it like 2 days late. 

Now a seemingly different firm sent her a letter recently saying they were going to take it to court. I told her it was probably because she sent it 2 days late. Anyway, I told her I wanted to help her out for mothers day and see if I could figure anything out. 

I called the number on the letter, and told this lady that I was calling for my grandma, and wanted to know why the debt isnt settled yet. She asked me my name, and I gave her my first name. Then she said that in order for her to talk about the debt with me, my grandma needed to give her permission. So i gave the phone to my grandma, she gave them the last 4 of her social, and her name. Then they asked her for my name again. I motioned to her to not give them my last name but she said it anyway by mistake (shes 80 years old, not as fast as she used to be I guess, she apologized though). Then I grabbed the phone from her and asked the lady for any information. Then she kept telling me the conversation was being recorded, and kept asking me for my social security number. Alarm bells were going off in my head. I hung up without giving her any more information of mine.

My concern is, was she trying to somehow attach me to the account, so they could go after me for the money in the event my grandma couldnt pay? The only information of mine they have is my first and last name (for all they know its fake), they do not have my address, social, dob, or anything else besides knowing im related to my grandma. I dont think I can help my grandma with this at all, she should get an attorney right? 

TLDR: Called collections agency for my grandma to try and figure out what is going on. They were shady the whole time and I hung up without learning anything useful. They have my first and last name, and nothing else. Should I be worried about them coming after me for the money? Should my grandma hire an attorney?

t3_giop20,personalfinance,Debating on where to move this summer. Torn between two locations/possibilities.,"What the title says. 

I currently have 2 options in mind. I could move within 20mins of work (where the cheapest nice apartments close are). Which would cost at minimum 600/month and close to 200/300 utilities. It would be 20mins from work and cut down on my gas somewhat. I'd say w that option, about 100/month in gas (I figured this from staying w a friend for a short while who lives near where I'd b moving). 

Or I could stay in the town I'm in, which is a small town. The same sized apartment would cost about 450/month and closer to 200/month in utilities. 35/40 minute drive from work. I spend about 160/month in gas. 

I'm just trying to think in the long run what would be better for me? It's only a 15 minute/60$ a month gas difference. But a 250$/month cash difference. 

And while part of me would love to be closer to work and friends, part of me would also prefer to have that money to save. I've already been driving the distance daily for almost 5 years to work and to see friends (vice versa). But I'm considering in the long run. 

I've also considered a middle third option of staying in my town for 1-2 years until my vehicle is paid off then moving closer once I have that extra change in my pocket. I'm also considering my privacy. I know being in my hometown would be nice because I'd be near some family in case of emergency, but on the other hand, that also means the possibility of more intrusions from said family. 

So, in looking for advice, what would anyone recommend? Any advice or input is greatly appreciated! 

*Side note: as far as budgeting and finances go, I could still afford either place if I moved, but again, I'm thinking in the long run of how much things would add up and how much I could save in the interim*","Debating on where to move this summer.

t3_giokjd,personalfinance,Recent college graduate seeking investment advice,"I graduated college two years ago and am on track to finish paying off my student loans next month. In doing so, I will free up a lot of money in my budget to invest.

Until the last couple of weeks, I have been investing investing up to my employer match of 6%. I have since changed this to 10% as I am trying to invest more aggressively. Out of the Fidelity funds available for me to select, I have chosen the SP 500 Index PL CL C. As I only just turned 24, I am not really interested in bonds and am willing to be aggressive and take on a bit of risk.

However, I have also opened up a Roth IRA where I contribute about an additional 5% of my earnings. It seems a bit trickier to select funds as there are a lot more to choose from. I would also like to be aggressive so I've been looking at investing in something like FNILX, which has an expense ratio of 0, or QQQ, which seems to be a known and and reputable fund.

I know that I said that I want to be aggressive and avoid bonds, but I'm also wondering if investing in something like QQQ or FNILX is redundant given my 401k fund.

Should I incorporate more international funds to compliment what I already have?

We called around for quotes and the best we received was from our current lender, who offered a 30-year rate of 2.825% with a monthly savings of $661, which we would immediately then re-apply to our monthly payment as principal, essentially keeping our monthly payment the same, paying off the loan roughly around the same time but slightly earlier, and just reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by about $184K. We would skip one month’s payment before our new loan goes into effect, then apply that deferred payment amount to our principal, and all we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5,101 and includes closing costs and per diem interest. So we’d break even within the first year.   
 
It seems like all of this makes sense, and we’ve been with this lender for 8 years now with absolutely no issues, but are there additional questions we should be asking that might change our decision?","Thinking about VA Streamline/IRRLMy husband and I have a 30-year VA mortgage with an interest rate of 3.75%.

t3_giogoh,personalfinance,Am I keeping too much in my emergency fund?,"So quick background: I'm married and have 1 child. I make a little over 100k a year and my wife brings in about 30k from her part time job and maybe another 30-40k from her other job (running a horse barn). I work in the auto industry, so things are a bit shaky right now which has me wondering on what I should do in my current situation.

My wife and I really don't have any debt other than a mortgage and both of our car payments. I have about 55k in an Ally savings account (where the interest used to be much better than it is right now). I end up saving almost 1k a month in that account, once it's average out throughout the year. The Ally account is pretty much my emergency fund, as I keep a separate Chase account that pays off the CC bills every month which most all of our bills go through. There is somewhere are 3-4k in there right now.

On to my question, I figure that to have about 12 months of funds to keep us going if I lose my job here would be about 40k to keep (15yr mortgage is about $2500, plus our car payments and other monthly expenses I came to about $3500 a month). My wife's job(s) are both extremely secure, so no worry about that. Does this seem about right? I'd like to potentially pay off the car loans as those are the only higher interest loans we have at about 4.5%. I'd also like to do some repairs around the house and would like to dip into the money we have saved up.

Also, I currently max out my 401k every year as well as my HSA. The only thing not being maxed out is the 529 for my kid, which maybe I should start doing though he just turned 1.

Pretty much what I'm looking for is in this current environment, how many months should I be looking to hang on to in the emergency fund? My job seems secure right now, but with it being in the auto industry you just never know what will happen with what is going on here.","Am I keeping too much in my emergency fund?So quick background: I'm married and have 1 child.

t3_gio4el,personalfinance,Credit Score Consequences?,"My wife has her own personal card that she uses for random purchases (it's a MC, and sometimes our VISA isn't accepted somewhere.) She had a $100 charge on in February that she forgot about - baby, quarantine, pandemic, etc. - and I was starting to look at our options for mortgage renewal later this summer (August) this weekend. I encouraged her to try out one of the free credit report websites (e.g. Borrowell) which is where we discovered this outstanding charge and its fairly **significant** impact on her credit score. She paid the $100 off immediately and contacted the credit card company, where they explained the account was now closed, but the new payment information would be shared with credit agencies after the 21st of May.

My question:  


1. How quickly will her credit score increase after dealing with this? There are no other issues of any kind on her report. We have a mortgage we have been paying at an accelerated rate over the the past five years, including extra payments and out credit utilization rate is very low.
2. We noticed our mortgage is not listed on either of our credit reports. Is this a limitation of a free credit report? Would this information be included on a hard inquiry made by a financial institution when it comes to renewing our mortgage, thereby giving a more accurate overview of her score (e.g. a higher one?)

Wishing this had been noticed earlier, and not four months old from when our current mortgage matures and we need to renew, but also hoping this is enough time to sort this out. Our concern is also that missed payments over this period of time are simply reported the same way, no matter how small the amount is (again, $100) and that it was an oversight.

Any insights would be very helpful!","Credit Score Consequences?My wife has her own personal card that she uses for random purchases (it's a MC, and sometimes our VISA isn't accepted somewhere.)

t3_ginviu,personalfinance,Someone fraudulently opened a CC in my name. I’m 99% sure it was a family member.,"I pulled my credit report for the first time this week to see someone opened a JC Penny’s CC in my name 05/03/2016, only to close it 05/09/2016. From what I can tell, it looks like whoever it was made on time payments for several months - I’m assuming maybe they made one big purchase and then paid it off? 

I’m pretty certain it was a family member. It wouldn’t make sense for someone to steal my identity and then proceed to make on-time payments and only open one account to never try again. I can’t think of anyone else that would just have all of my information. 

I called JCP CC services and filed a fraud complaint. They confirmed the account was opened in a store, meaning whoever it was would have had to have an ID. They also registered the account to my address at the time and phone number. No email was listed. 

I opened an investigation with TransUnion. Is there anything else I should be doing? Does it make more sense that it would be a loved one who opened the account than a complete stranger? Feeling really uneasy about all of this.","Someone fraudulently opened a CC in my name.

t3_gintnl,personalfinance,Is there much of a downside to borrow $5k from my 401k at 4.75% to pay down a 10% auto loan?,"As of next month, I'll have about $7k on 0% APR credit cards until at least July 2021, all other credit paid off, and a refinanced mortgage with a $300/mo payment shaved off.

After all expenses, I'll have $2,000 available per month--this is factoring in extraneous expenses on average, so $2k+. No other debt will be left; I'll be paying off the last of my personal loan and all other credit cards are paid off in full every statement cycle (most bills go on credit).

This is the first time I'll be basically debt free.

I have $5,700 remaining on my auto loan, which is at 10% APR (higher than I remembered it). I have $10k in my 401k, which I only started contributing to again this month since I was aggressively paying off credit card debt.

No other savings, besides a growing HSA which I won't touch unless we have an emergency and have to pay full deductible.

I was going to throw most of the $2k on my auto loan, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to take out a $5k loan from my 401k for 6 months instead, and at least pay the interest to myself. Pay off the car, pay back the 401k loan, budget the rest of the $2k toward making sure I pay off the $7.5k 0% APR cards before the promo rate expires, and put the rest into a savings account.

Is there a downside to this plan?

t3_ginsis,personalfinance,"Should I choose 401k, IRA, or backdoor Roth IRA?","Yes I've read the sidebar, and a lot on the subject, but there doesn't seem to be a definitive best answer for my situation. I'm hoping I can give some of the smarter people here some personal details so that I can gather more catered advice.

details:

My employer offers a non-matched 401k which I've been using because it's easy. Wife and I make enough where we can't do a Roth IRA without using the backdoor method, and also make enough so that IRA contributions don't lower our taxes (I think that's how it works?). In case it matters, she has a great 50% matched 401k which she fills up every year, and I should retire with a great employer sponsored pension and health insurance from my union, so these retirement savings under discussion are more supplemental than primary.

We live in a HCOL area so we make a lot and spend a lot. For what it's worth, I grew up modestly and can see myself retiring that way. But it's good to have options

So far Ive learned the benefits of the 401k for my situation are that it lowers my taxable income, and the detriments are that it's 1) the most restrictive to access, and 2) doesn't have many investment options (offers goal-date funds with fidelity). The IRA seems annoying to deal with tax-wise (I contribute post-tax but somehow it's pretax), and the Roth IRA seems pretty cool.

Tangent question: should I take advantage of the CARES act and move some of my 401k into last year's and this year's Roth IRAs (backdoor)?  I have a brokerage account with Vanguard and I like them.

Not sure this is the best place to post this, if it's not maybe someone could direct me to a better subreddit to pose this question.

Anyway, to the question!

I kind of just kept assuming it would arrive eventually. This year doing my 2019-20 tax return I realized I never got my federal return back!

t3_ginga8,personalfinance,Refi or Refi Cash Out,"Hi everyone.  I was again looking for some advice from those interested/knowledgeable on the mortgage topic.

I currently have a 30 year/4% loan (about 5 years in).  Bought the home for 300k and now its worth about 450k.  I owe 190k currently, and I have a HELOC opened for 60k that I have not accessed.  

I am looking into refinancing and found the lowest currently to be a 3.125%/15 year.  If it was not for my HELOC, I would be able to get a 3.0%.  Also, it seems that refi-cashouts are currently not available due to COVID.

Do you all think it would be wise to:

1) Take the 15 year refi now and keep the HELOC?
2) Keep the 30 year mortgage and wait for better 15 year rates/until refi-cash outs are available, whenever that is?
3) Keep the 30 year and pay it down aggressively like a 15 year?

t3_gincht,personalfinance,keep contributing only to 401k or diversify monthly retirement contributions?,"Hi PF! Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

I'm trying to figure out the best place to contribute the money I set aside for retirement each month. (Apologies if this is an easy q, but I haven't been able to find an answer using the PF wiki.)

For context: I'm 30, I'm a school social worker, and I'm making 75k (will go up to 80 in August when my new contract begins). I plan to stay at this job for a while, but I know that this salary is on the higher end for my profession, and I don't anticipate earning much more than 100k/year in the future. Right now, I contribute 11% to my 401k (employer matches 1%). I have a traditional IRA that I opened years ago with Fidelity with several thousand dollars in it, and just rolled over a Roth IRA that my parents had opened for me years ago to Fidelity, also with several thousand dollars.

My question: where should I be putting my retirement savings? Right now, I'm only actively contributing to my 401k. Does it make sense for me to contribute money more equally between the 401k, Roth, and traditional IRA? How would you advise me to contribute it, given that 401k is taken out pre-tax, but there are advantages at the time of withdrawal with IRAs?

Thanks in advance!

t3_gina4s,personalfinance,I Have A New Job Offer,"Hi, everyone. I am going for an interview tomorrow! I do currently have a job. However, it is in an entry level position and pays minimum wage ($13 per hour) in a high cost of living area. I am college-edicated, have earned an important certification since I began working at my current job fourteen months ago and I am actively pursuing another highly regarded industry certification.

I have my hands in a little of everything, given that the company is just my boss and me (a small LLC). But most of my duties are administrative. Billing, invoicing, filing, etc. But I also create documents for clients, collect data, onboard them, send them forms they need, sit in on meetings and record the minutes, troubleshoot technology issues, help to ensure compliance, etc. Needless to say, my knowledge in the field is rapidly growing. 

I am already grossly underpaid, but when I was hired I really needed the money, so I took what I could get (I also came from a completely different industry and thus had no experience a year ago). 

The new job says starting salary is $40,000-45,000, equivalent to $19.23 to $21.63 per hour. But the person I've been in contact with says I will likely start closer to the $15-16 per hour range and be rapidly promoted to closer to $20 after an as yet undetermined probationary period, although an official offer has not been made. The average salary for an administrative assistant in my area ranges from about $39,000-$48,000. My title at the new company would be something like Client Services Administrator. I feel that with my additional knowledge above and beyond the basics of office administration, I should be paid more.

My question is this: Given the fact that I am only making $13 per hour currently, how hard should I negotiate for a higher salary right off the bat? Should I take the likely initial $15-16 per hour and be happy when I get $19 or $20 per hour in a few months? Or should I go in and tell them the average salary of administrative assistants in the area and hope they at least meet that upfront? I don't think I'd be greedy asking for $19.25 per hour ($40,000) upfront, but I also don't want to turn them off. I've never been in a position to negotiate before and I feel like I have some leverage because the offer to interview came completely unsolicited.","I Have A New Job OfferHi, everyone.

t3_gin9fq,personalfinance,Planning ahead as a Flight Attendant who's been out on Worker's Compensation,"Hi All! I am currently employed in good standing with a US domestic airline as a flight attendant. However, due to a workplace injury, I have been out for almost 2 years and receiving worker's compensation benefits. In a few weeks, I will have reached the 2 year mark and will no longer receive work comp payments. After that, I will be applying for California state disability benefits. I cannot apply for disability until 7 days before my current worker's compensation benefits end, and I have no idea what my benefits for disability will look like, assuming I am granted any.  

Ok so:  I finish up spinal post-operation physical therapy with a goal of returning to work around August, but possibly delayed to the fall. Unfortunately, it is looking like my Airline will have furloughs starting October, very close to when I hoped to finally be back full time. 

In the interest of planning ahead, my question is regarding **what will count as 'income' when I do file for unemployment.**

* small, not steady monthly paychecks from my company, usually under $200. These were infrequent and only so I could stay on company health insurance, etc. They were taxed accordingly. 
* Possible Disability payments I would receive in a few weeks, between when work comp ends and until returning to work
* If I am able to return to work for a month or two before furloughs occur, payroll then would of course count towards past income. (side question, is it in my interest to work as much as possible if I return for even a month to help boost my 'past income'?)

I appreciate your help. I cannot find a straight answer online, on the California EDD website, or even from my attorney. It's a scary time for everyone right now, and any advice about how I can plan ahead is greatly valued.","Planning ahead as a Flight Attendant who's been out on Worker's CompensationHi All! I am currently employed in good standing with a US domestic airline as a flight attendant. However, due to a workplace injury, I have been out for almost 2 years and receiving worker's compensation benefits. In a few weeks, I will have reached the 2 year mark and will no longer receive work comp payments. After that, I will be applying for California state disability benefits. I cannot apply for disability until 7 days before my current worker's compensation benefits end, and I have no idea what my benefits for disability will look like, assuming I am granted any.  

Ok so:  I finish up spinal post-operation physical therapy with a goal of returning to work around August, but possibly delayed to the fall. Unfortunately, it is looking like my Airline will have furloughs starting October, very close to when I hoped to finally be back full time.

t3_gin145,personalfinance,Will paying off a section of my student loan harm my credit score?,"Edit: I've decided to hold on to my extra cash and use it towards buying a car in the next few months. After I've bought the car I won't have any hesitations about paying off loans impacting my credit score because it will be a while until the next time I need an inquiry. 

Original post:

My student loan is divided into 4 sections. My regular monthly payment gets divided up and sent to each loan group based on the minimum monthly payment. Because of the current student loan forbearance I'm not making monthly payments. Instead of continuing to send the money to be evenly divided as usual, I thought this would be a good time to direct all my extra money to totally pay off the loan group with the highest interest and lowest dollar amount.

I was surprised earlier this year when I paid off my car loan and my credit score fell from 740 to 715. I figured out it was because one of the aspects of the credit score is ""Total Accounts"" and more open accounts is better. The score recovered since then and the only thing harming me is the short length of credit (5 years).

I now have 4 installment loans (student) and 1 revolving (credit card) account. Even though I am able to pay off one of the installment loans I am worried about the effect that having one fewer open account will have on my score. I think that the benefit of avoiding additional interest outweighs the potential negative impact to the score but I could be wrong.

Am I overthinking this? Is it a good idea to pay off the loan groups as fast as I can or are there benefits to keeping a small balance in each one?","Will paying off a section of my student loan harm my credit score?Edit: I've decided to hold on to my extra cash and use it towards buying a car in the next few months.

t3_gimqfc,personalfinance,Buy new home now or wait one-two more years,"Hello personalfinance!

Long time lurker here, wanted to get your guys input on my current situation.  Currently own a 2 bedroom condo in Southern California, but looking to upgrade to a single family home with at least 3 bedrooms.  Would you guys recommend pulling the trigger now and getting in to a new home or wait it out a few more years to save more of a down payment?

Here is a breakdown of our current situation:

* Household income: $210K ($140K me, $70K wife), both in stable jobs, take home is about $10K a month, with bonuses quarterly of $5K - take home about $2.7K after taxes
* Down payment savings = $105K ($35K + \~$70K in equity at the moment in our condo)
* Current mortgage w/ HOA fee: $3,154 (tax and insurance is impounded)
* CC Debt: $0, all other expenses budgeted monthly: $2,500-$3,000 which includes all entertainment expenses as well
* No kids at the moment, have family that has committed to day care once that is part of the plan down the road

We are looking at houses in the $750K range but I am hesitant to take our mortgage too high. I know we would have to pay a chunk for PMI but I am confident that the mortgage calculators are overestimating what our PMI would be monthly. Would it make sense to get in to the new house now without a full 20% down payment?  I know rates are very low right now and am confident we could secure a great rate. Or would you recommend waiting a few more years to save up that full 20% to avoid PMI cost.

t3_gimgz6,personalfinance,An attacker accessed my bank accounts and transferred money out. I don't know what to do.,"
May 2nd I found out someone had accessed my savings account and made a series of transfers out of the account without my knowledge. This started April 17th. I called my bank and disputed the charges. Then I found out 2 additional accounts were accessed and had money transferred out of them. I called those banks and reported the fraud. Then I found out the attacker also accessed my email and created filtering rules to delete email notifications about transfers from those three banks.

I formatted my computer which is my only suspicion for how this happened. I changed all my passwords. I froze my credit with all 3 bureaus. I also added a fraud alert to all 3 bureaus. I pulled my free credit report to verify no additional lines of credit had been created. I also filed a police report with my local police department. 

The 3 banks did refund the money to my accounts, contingent on an ongoing investigation. By all rights they should find the transfers really were fraudulent, but it makes me really nervous they could rule against me and then I'd have to escalate somehow. 

Then over the next few days I received bank cards from new bank accounts in my name. The first was for a ""Stride Bank / Chime Me"" Bank. I had never heard of this bank before. The money from the first savings account was transferred to this ""Stride Bank"" but I do not know how the attacker planned to access the money. 

Then I received another bank card from ""Green Dot Bank / Unlimited Cash Back Bank Account"". This was also fraudulently opened in my name. I called and reported the fraud to the bank. The bank refused to tell me any details about when the account was opened, if there were any funds in the account, or if any withdrawals occurred.

Today I received another bank card from a third bank ""Green Dot Bank / Walmart Money Card"". I am currently on hold with this bank - which has the same ""thank you for your patience"" voice as the Green Dot Bank I called yesterday.

I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know how to stop additional bank accounts from being opened in my name. I have currently been on hold over 90 minutes waiting for the fraud department. I am so worn out on talking to these banks. I also don't know what the attacker was planning to do with these bank accounts. I guess maybe he had online access and could withdraw the money without the bank card? Or was he planning on raiding my mailbox (since he has my address and all) to get the physical bank card?

Can anyone shed any light on what the attacker is trying to accomplish? Should I expect even more bank accounts in the mail? I am hopeful that these 3 bank accounts corresponded to the 3 of my real bank accounts that were attacked, and maybe there won't be any more. 

Is there anything I can do with this ""Green Dot Bank"" that has allowed an attacker to illegally open 2 accounts in my name? And then kept me on hold for over 90 minutes (SO FAR) to just report the fraud? It is sickening.","An attacker accessed my bank accounts and transferred money out. I don't know what to do.

t3_gimg4z,personalfinance,"Parents buy my mortgage, act as new lenders?","Recently, my stepdad proposed replacing our home loan with a loan from them. They said they were planning to liquidate some of their assets and offered to use the cash they got to pay off our mortgage, and then have us treat them as the agency that owns our mortgage. They said they'd still charge interest, but it would be lower than what we currently have (3.875%) and presumably free of PMI. We just closed on the house in January, so home-ownership and paying off that debt is still relatively new to us. Still, on the surface, this looks like a win-win deal - We get a better interest rate, no PMI, and they get our interest payments.

Would it generally be advisable to take advantage of this? Would it affect how we build credit? Deduct our interest from our taxes each year? What other considerations would we want to take into account, other than any family issues that might come up (Very good relationship with my mother and stepfather - No drama in the years he has been in my family).

t3_gimbvp,personalfinance,Preppy Mortgage or Invest in Index Funds,"Hi r/personalfinace!  I just signed a 30 year fixed rate mortgage which is substantially lower than my previous interest rate (which was a 30 year fixed at 4.75% with 28 years remaining). The result is that I’m saving about $600/month in P&amp;I payments. According to a few online calculators, if I pay that $600/month from day 1 towards extra principle the loan will be paid off in 21 years and I’ll save $87.5k in interest. 

-Other info: Wife and I both max our 401k

-3 kids (oldest is 10) but we have no college savings. 

-6 months expenses saved for emergency 

Should we pay down the mortgage or invest in stock funds (I like low cost S&amp;P 500 index funds from fidelity or similar) or invest in 529?  

I have looked at the flow chart, but the college issue is what worries me the most.

t3_gimajs,personalfinance,Paying credit card early,"I have two credit cards I use most often. My primary card is due at the beginning of every month and my secondary card is due around mid month.

Is there any disadvantage to paying the card this way? Could it be hurting my credit or affecting interest charges?

t3_gimadq,personalfinance,I need help making better financial decisions and choies.,"Hello,

I am in a high paying job but I will leave it in a few months. It is a contracting job overseas and I want to go back to the United States.

**My Savings:**

3k - HYSA

4k - Taxable Brokerage

13k - ROTH IRA

9k - 401k

8k - 401k 

3k - Checking account

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly paycheck: 13503.16**

Taxes - 4607.36

Deduction - 188.81

401k - 2025.5

Net income - 6682.84

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly spending**

2400 Mortgage

600 bills 

3000 HYSA

682 remainder (prob more hysa)

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

I have virtually no savings right now because I just bought a house.

329,000 k remainder, 4.5% APR. I will refinance as soon as I get an opportunity upon my return.

No doubt, I am in a very fortunate position. However, I want to go home and enjoy my life in the United States. I want to settle down and start a family.

The problem is, I am not sure what I want to do when I go home. My current job overseas is a defense contract and my job isn't really applicable in the states. 

I do have a bachelor's degree from a top school but it is in a science field I no longer want to puruse.

I have a job offer from a three letter agency but it is in the East Coast. I bought my house in the West Coast.

I have not filed my 2019 taxes yet. I have extended until October. The reason being is that I will be eligible for the FEIE in July 15th. I think I'll get a good chunk back.

I'm trying to hold on to December 2020. This way, i can do FEIE for 2020 and get a large chunk back. it is about 20k I get in tax returns if I stay here the whole time. Maybe a lil less because CA. 

The reason I bought my house is because I found out my immediate family (mom and sibling) were next to homeless. As an exchange, they take care of my house while my sibling is finishing college and I am doing whatever I want overseas.

Once my sibling graduates college, I will let them build savings for a year and then will have them leave.

My mom, she can come or go. I think she wants to leave. I don't mind, there are plenty of rooms in the home.

I  have a few large purchases that I need to save up for

\- Refinancing my house. 

\- A car. I think I am going to get a cheap car under 10k? A used Honda or something.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questons**

1) Should I maintain my 401k contribution rate at this economical climate? My fundamentals says yes because DCA, time in the market blah blah

2) My 401k is a traditional because my tax bracket is pretty high especially in California. After I quit here, I was going to take a year off and then just convert my trad 401k to my roth IRA. (allowed?)

I think this is a good idea because I will get a tax break for 2020 and can get money into my ROTH while my taxable income is low during 2021.

3) I am going to take a few months off. To do some soul searching on what I want to do.Therefore, I need to save up for a year of savings. 3000 x 12 = 36,000 in my HYSA seem reasonable?

4) Off topic quetsion, does anyone have any recommendations of career advice? I don't really want to work in Defense anymore. Nor do I want to work in biochem (degree). I'm kind of a wanderer.","I need help making better financial decisions and choies.Hello,

t3_gim984,personalfinance,"Bad credit but good job, financing a car for the first time","Hello everyone! I know that PF hates financing new cars from what I’ve read but most of the horror stories seem to be people that are already struggling before getting into a car loan. 

Anyway about me I am in my late 20’s and have always just paid in full in cash for all of my cars. They all inevitably break down after a few years and I repeat this cycle. The current car I was in got t-boned and is still drivable but it has just gotten away from me. Check engine light on, brake light on, side mirror destroyed, registration out etc. I’ve avoided repairing these things (all recent things) because I’ve been planning on moving on to a new car soon anyway. I work in management for a large medical company and just got a big promotion and have fantastic job security. The only downside is I’ve not done much throughout my life to improve my credit and have had a few things zap the life out of my credit score until it settled at 568 which is where it’s at now. 

I’m at a point where instead of buying beaters to get through the life I want to get a reliable, new car that I will have for quite some time and gets great gas mileage for my commute and that will also allow me to help build my credit in conjunction with secured credit card, etc. 

I have started the process at a Toyota dealership with a 2019 Corolla that only has 10k miles on it. They’re selling it for $13,990 which is below market for it. At first they were estimating my terms to be 5k down with a payment of $286/month over the dreaded 72 months. After leaving last night I played around their website and looked at what if I bought the car online from them and it came to 4k down and $281/month. 

From what I’ve been told by friends and family I should go in there and tell them I have 4k to put down and that I could do a monthly rate of 260 instead of 286 and tell them if they can match that then I would buy. 

Now I know my interest rate is going to be astronomical and easily 20%+ which adds an insane amount of money paid out in interest over the 72 months. I figured that I have another 6k in bonuses arriving next month and was planning on using another 2k of that to pay on the principle and to repeat that next year when my bonuses come in as well. I also plan on 6 months down the line attempting to refinance with my credit union that I’ve been at for 5 years (they denied my application for initial financing) to work on getting the interest rate down lower.","Bad credit but good job, financing a car for the first timeHello everyone!

t3_gim7as,personalfinance,Any way to cancel payment plan to IRS for paying taxes?,"My husband and I owed taxes for 2019, and we efiled in Februrary while having some financial problems. When we filed through turbotax, we chose to set up a payment plan with the IRS. After that, because the the new tax deadline, we no longer require the payment plan, as we'll be able to pay in full by July.

I've gotten 1 letter in the mail in March, from the IRS, as an initial response for setting up the payment plan, stating that we'll get full details sent to us within 90 days. I sent a letter back stating that the payment plan is longer needed and provided my contact details.

I haven't heard back from them yet and I want to know of there's anything else that I should be doing. I looked on turbotax but it seems that theres no way to modify it from there.

My parents currently have 100,000 sitting in a checking account at a bank building no interest. Yes $100,000 USD!! They are a little older so they are nervous about putting it in the market, which I understand. So I was looking into maybe setting up a high yield savings account at HSBC as they offer 1.6% APY currently. They don't want it in CD's because they want access to it in case of an emergency. Do you guys think HSBC is my current best option?

I know the best thing to do it put the money into a stock like $KO because their dividend would be like 3% and I could essentially use that as a savings account, but with so much uncertainty with the virus they really wanna stay away from.

This led me to choose between capital one and ally, but i constantly hear more about ally being better than capital one. The things I look for in a savings account is

1.Being able to create and categorize different types of savings accounts for different goals (buying a house, emergency funds, a gaming pc)

2.Stability and security in where I save money in (FDIC insured).

3.Great customer service and user-friendly app to keep track of finances.

t3_gill4x,personalfinance,Should I take a penalty-free loan from my 401k for home improvement?,"I've been fortunate to not be affected financially affected by the coronavirus too much. I work for an essential business, on salary, and it's very unlikely anything will affect my job status at my current company. My wife is currently finishing her masters, and will begin as a teacher in the Fall. I'm 27, married, and we own our home. We have about $10k in savings and $30k in a 401k. We have 2 credit cards w/ total of $15k limit, and we don't carry a balance. One card is 0% APR for 9 more months, and I can transfer some of the credit limit from the other card to this one if desired.

I purchased the home back in January 2018, and it was a new home that had no landscaping done to the backyard. I've kinda slacked off from getting it done since then, but being recently married has now made me want to have our backyard landscaped. I estimate that my plans for the backyard will cost about $15k. I also believe that this pandemic will allow for there to be great discounts on projects such as this.

With the recent US stimulus package, it enables me to loan from my 401k penalty-free. Would it be a reasonable decision to pull $10k from the 401k to fund my home improvement project? I understand that pulling from it now may make me miss out when the economy begins coming back. But I also don't foresee the economy coming back quickly, and believe most of the loan could be repaid prior to the stock market rebounding.

Thanks in advance!

**Edit**: Thank you for all of the replies. From the responses, it seems like this is not the best way to go about it. I initially figured that getting \~20% savings on the project from doing it during the pandemic would offset the earnings I would've received if I don't pull from the 401k. 

Sounds like my best bet would be to either 1) save and complete the project later, 2) pay in installments, or 3) look into other loan options, such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC)","Should I take a penalty-free loan from my 401k for home improvement?I've been fortunate to not be affected financially affected by the coronavirus too much.

t3_giljzr,personalfinance,Are auto loans ever worth it? (CAN),"As the title states, I (22F) am wondering if a car loan is ever worth it. I have looked at the PF Vehicles Wiki and will continue to go through those resources, but want some personal feedback as well.

Some background:
- I am looking at upgrading to a larger vehicle (SUV)
- I have decent but minimal credit as I typically prefer to pay for things upfront. I bought my last vehicle with cash, pay my auto insurance yearly rather than monthly, and paid for my university tuition in full each year. 
- I have a credit card but only really use it when necessary (i.e. booking something online). 
- I have very minimal monthly bills as I am living at home while going to school. I have pretty robust savings and I currently work full time, but I plan on going to grad school in fall 2021. My graduate studies will most likely be fully funded but will not allow time for me to work (at most I will be able to work part-time).

Pros to financing/getting a loan:
- Build up my credit
- Less money upfront
- Could likely get a nicer vehicle 

Cons:
- Owe monthly
- Vehicles depreciate fast
- Will be difficult to find a co-signer since nobody in my life has very good credit

Any advice about auto loans or purchasing a vehicle is welcome! Thank you!

t3_gil8z6,personalfinance,Leaving the country,"Hello! This is my first post and I’m doing it from my phone so I apologize if I mess up the formatting. 

I(25F) am currently a junior in college(US) and I’m looking at my options for once I graduate next year. I’ve really been contemplating moving back to my home country, I just feel like I never really adjusted to the American lifestyle to be honest( I’ve been since I was 8, so most of my life). 

I have dual citizenship, born in the US and nationalized in my home country since both my parents are citizens there. My question is, if I decide to move, do I still need to file taxes even though I wouldn’t be living not working in the US?

t3_gil8qw,personalfinance,My company borrowed my PTO from next year...,"... to pay for a week of the shutdown before we were laid off. I had plans for this PTO. I had prepared for unemployment via E fund and a few other things

I told my boss I didn't want to use the PTO and wanted to save it. So he did. Payroll decided to give a separate deposit of the PTO. This happened a 2nd week as well. 

I was told I can trade work days to buy them back, but here is my problem: taxes. 

I'm single and make around 100k. 

I was taxed on the unwanted use. 

I'm pretty sure I'll be taxed on the days I use to buy this back. 

I'll be taxed on when I use it as I had planned. 

My tax rate is around 24%.

That's a lot of money I'm on the hook for that I didn't want.  

What can I do? 

I'm pretty sure it'll even out at tax time but I'm pretty pissed about this. I live like I'm still making $10/hr, I didn't need their management of my finances. I apparently wasn't even given an option.

I'll be talking to payroll tomorrow but I need to know what is up so I can say/ask/demand the right things

t3_gil75o,personalfinance,Mandatory minimum balance fees for bank accounts,"Hi all,

I just remembered that I have a spare checking account with a few hundred dollars on it that I don't use regularly.

I know that this is completely my fault, but I was wondering if anyone has successfully negotiated their  fees down via a phone call?

I've been looking for jobs since, but I haven't found much success. I've interviewed with two companies, and from my conversations, I would be a shoe-in at one, but the max the salary would be is $10k less ($80k to $70k) than what I was earning prior to my layoff.

I have an MBA and six total years of experience (2 in my field), and I will be taking a test to get professional credentials in my field before the end of the month. Is it worth it to take a significant drop in pay? The company is a household name with ""big potential for growth"" and that ""will only promote from within.""

My mom passed away unexpectedly this week, she was in her 50's. She was still married to my dad after 40 years. Mom was the main caretaker for my grandma, her mother, but more on that later. Mom was a gambler, we all knew this, but we did not know the extent of her problems. It appears she was around $40k in debt, and hired a law firm to help with debt consolidation. She also just signed a contract to have solar panels put on the roof.  I have some questions. 1. Now that she is gone, what will happen to that debt? Will it be passed on to my father? She had credit card debt as well as large paypal account balance, and also had borrowed money from some small local loan companies. 2.  Are we still obligated to go forward with the solar panels? She did sign a contract but it was just her that did it, my dad was unaware. We have not yet received the death certificate so I don't want to call again until I have the proof in hand.

Secondly, grandma. Apparently grandma closed a 6 figure bank account a few years ago and gave mom the money to invest. We assumed that money was gone, however we got a tip that there is a trust fund open in grandma's name, and maybe the missing money is there? How can we find the trust fund? Grandma is old and doesn't remember much so she is no help. Is there some type of database we can use to input her social and show us the open accounts? Or someone we can call?

t3_gikwho,personalfinance,Car dealership wants to change terms of payment after transaction complete,"So I helped my niece purchase a used Audi vehicle from an Audi dealership in Texas, several hundred miles from me (I'm also in Texas). She confirmed with the salesman/dealer BEFORE driving there that they would accept payment from me using my debit card and her trade-in. There is NO financing involved in this transaction. 

She goes there the next day, dealer requested a photo of my ID, which is understandable given that I'm paying via debit card (I called the bank before hand to raise the daily limit on my card to cover the transaction). Dealer takes my debit card info over the phone and I watch my bank account in real time as their charge appears on my screen as ""pending.""  Dealer takes the trade-in, paperwork is signed, niece drives away in her newly acquired Audi. 

Two days later, dealer calls my niece saying they ""accidentally"" ran my debit card as a credit card, and now wants to reverse the charge, and for me to go to the bank and obtain a cashier's check to send to the dealer, or wire the funds to the dealer. Perhaps I'm overly suspicious, but my spidey-sense is tingling that this seems a bit shady/scammish to me. I checked my bank account and the dealer has been paid and the charge is no longer ""pending"" and the funds are out of my account. I tell my niece that this sounds kind of ""off"" to me, and I seriously doubt they would ""accidentally"" put a transaction that large through as a credit instead of a debit, given the percentage a credit card transaction would have been on this transaction. Perhaps things have changed from my retailer days, but when I had a merchant services agreement, debit card fees were a minimal, flat-rate amount per transaction, and not a percentage of the sale.

What are other possibilities I am overlooking about this? Am I just being excessively cynical in my distrust of the dealer's motives in this situation? If they do refund the transaction, am I at risk by mailing them  a personal check (if they agree to that), as I am not really inclined to go to the bank to wire funds to them, or obtain a cashier's check (both of which will cost me a fee as well)?","Car dealership wants to change terms of payment after transaction completeSo I helped my niece purchase a used Audi vehicle from an Audi dealership in Texas, several hundred miles from me (I'm also in Texas).

t3_gikqy7,personalfinance,Best Financial Strategy,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking with my brother and I'm now trying to figure out the best way to set myself up for a better financial future. 

I currently have 36,000 in student loan debt.

I will be going to school in a few weeks to get a second bachelor's degree as a registered nurse. The tuition will be paid by the post 9/11 GI bill in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Program so I don't need to worry about that. 

While in school I will be making about 4,000 a month (tax free) between VA disability and the stipend from the GI bill.

I was originally going to take this time to aggressively pay off my student loans, but I'm now wondering if perhaps I should refinance to a lower rate, pay them off at a longer time and take the extra money and invest in the market. Right now my interest rates for the loans are at 0% until at least September due to the Coronavirus legislation. After that, I believe they sit somewhere at about 5%.

I have about 15k in savings, 3k in mutual funds, 15k in retirement, and 1k cash. I only pay 250 in rent, for the next year, but will move after that. 

What do you think it is that I should do?

Thanks in advance.","Best Financial StrategyHello everyone!

t3_gikjfc,personalfinance,My parents recently became wealthy. What should I do?,"So my parents where already in a really good place financially, but recently through a few shrewd business moves they went from good to great. Since this wasn’t a quick earn I don’t foresee a quick loss on it. Quite the opposite. They have always been the type to keep their money in the bank and live off of dividends, SSI, and one of them still works. 

This latest thing however is a game changer. A real life changing amount of money. It’s got me thinking what that will mean for me later in life.

But it’s something I’m actively learning to improve. 

I know that one day I will come in to a significant inheritance because they will not spend all this money. I don’t want to screw it up. I don’t want to spend it all on myself that I leave nothing for my own children one day. 

Is there anything I should do?  My parents are pretty open with me about investments and stuff but I don’t get too nosey. It’s not my money yet after all, and truly I want them to just live comfortably and happy as long as they can.   I just don’t want to one day have it dropped in my lap and do something stupid.

Edit. For a sub called personalfinance there sure is a lot of salty people in here. I came looking for advice on how to prepare to have more money.

t3_gikj2r,personalfinance,Buying A Home w/ Student Loans,"First-time Home Buyer (potentially) here in need of advice.

My wife and I recently welcomed our first child, and we are beginning to consider possibly leaving our rental and purchasing a home. We have been paying $1200/month for the last year and a half on our rental home, which is an old home but is enough space for our small family. Currently, before tax, our combined income is approx. 120k/year.

Growing up, my parents never owned a home, therefore I am extremely hesitant to take the plunge without careful evaluation. My primary hang up is that I recently graduated law school with $80k in student loans. Luckily, the $80k is the only debt that we have. Both cars are paid off and we have never used a credit card. I've recently started a stable job, therefore our plan is to begin to aggressively pay off this student loan in order to become debt free. If we were to purchase a home, we have agreed to keep it under $200k, which would buy a nice home in our area of the country.

My question is this: would it be smarter to pay off my student loan completely over the next 3-4 years/continue to rent before purchasing a home? Or is it feasible to own a home in that price range while simultaneously paying off the $80k? I feel that my earning capacity has great upside, but the thought of taking on additional debt on top of my student loans does make me hesitant, especially considering that there is not necessarily anything wrong with our current living situation. Should I save money for a down payment while also paying off the $80k? Or focus all energy towards the student loan?

I’m 23 years old and I’ve been a licensed driver for almost three years. I have State Farm and pay 200 bucks a month for my 2017 Hyundai Sonata (full coverage).

When I first got with them I was paying around 300. 200 is obviously better but I can’t help but feel ripped off. I’ve been with the same company for a while now and I’m a good driver. Never missed a payment either.

Also I pay 383 a month for my car payment. I called the other day and my bank said that the pay out was 12,500. I have enough to pay it all off, but I was conflicted as to what I should do.

My mom says that it’s good to have a car payment because it shows that you’re reliable, but I’ve had it for 1 year and 7 months. Do I gain anything by continuing to have this payment? Is it better to just refinance it?

t3_gik3oh,personalfinance,Breaking a lease to purchase a new home,"I recently entered the home purchasing market but I still have until the end of October on my current lease.  I can break the lease by paying the equivalent of 2 months in a break fee &amp; offering 2 month's notice.  This effectively equals 4 months of additional rent, if we try to break our lease when we purchase a home.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to know if anyone has advice on how difficult/expensive it is to break a lease and if it is worth it.  The reason we are interested in jumping into the housing market now has to do with the great interest rates on mortgages and the level of inventory available and negotiable right now, given the market conditions.

t3_gijxdd,personalfinance,Graduated Payment Mortgage formula,"Hi PF community,

I wanted to see if anyone here who is either a math person or who specializes in mortgage amortization can help me through the application of a graduated-payment mortgage formula. The formula in question is equation 8 at the bottom of the 6th page of this document: https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/D_Winkler_Graduated_1998(MULTI%20UNCG%20AUTHORS).pdf

My question is--how do I manipulate the formula to re-amortize partway through the repayment period? I'm not a math person at all, and I have to believe there's some algebra involved, or changing one of the exponents, or something like that. 

For example, say there are 5 payment tiers (the initial one followed by 4 graduations), and each payment tier lasts for 2 years before the next one, so this would be a 10-year graduated mortgage, or 120 monthly payments. Say I get the value for the initial payment, and then I derive the values of the other payments with PMT(1 + g)^t. But then, say the borrower becomes delinquent, or goes through a period of forbearance or whatever, and this occurs after month 6. Now, the lender re-amortizes the payments so that the mortgage is still paid off within 10 years. How now do I derive the value of the next 18 payments for the first tier, and then the corresponding 4 subsequent tiers?

This might be really simple--again, I'm not a math person. Thanks for anyone who can help or who can point me in the right direction!","Graduated Payment Mortgage formulaHi PF community,

So long story short, my mom dated/lived with a guy for many years.  I lived with them for a bit after I graduated from college, and during this time my mom got cancer and myself her boyfriend (we'll call him Dan) and I took care of her. He worked and I stayed in to take care of her until she passed and we became very close.  He's like a second father to me.  Well his Dan's Dad passed and left him a size-able amount of stock, of which was willed 7 of his children inlcuding Dan.  One of Dan's fathers wishes was to have his children also do the same for 7 people and since Dan has no kids I guess I'm it.   


He rang and told me to make an account with Schwab and to send him the 8 numbers after detailing the amount of shares he was going to give.  I don't know anything about the Stock except its current value, and there's about 125 shares of it for now, and every year in January he's going to give me more.  I'ts not millionaire numbers but if I'm smart now it could take care of me in retirement many many years down the road.  


So what kind of account do I need to open?  The Schwab website was so confusing.  On the Make an Account Page it has so many options.  Is it a Brokerage?  I think I'll just continue to live on my job's earnings and maybe learn how to invest or at least watch the value go up or go down for a bit since the market sounds like its all over the place right now.  I could use the money to start paying off my student loans which is a huge goal for me as I move into my 30's.

t3_gijj15,personalfinance,"Accidentally removed myself from employer-provided health insurance plan (California, Santa Clara county)","Hello everyone! Hope you and your loved ones are well and safe. 

**TLDR -**   
**Accidentally removed myself from the employer-provided health insurance plan, feeling pretty vulnerable, physically with covid and mentally with the potential expenses if I get sick for what so ever reason -  what are my options?**

My partner got a new job and since their employer provides health insurance benefits, I wanted to take them off of my employer's Kaiser plan. In the process, I, unfortunately, removed myself too. The bigger mistake, I did not read the selections email either. This happened in March 1st week. 

I realized that this has happened when I tried to reorder a prescription this month and got an automated call that my membership has been terminated.

I am trying to appeal this with my employer's benefits provider and in the meanwhile wanted to tap into the hive mind here to understand what my other options are. The current situation adds more soup to my situation and I am legit scared right now. The appeal timeline is typically 30 days and I am trying to find a solution for the interim. Here's what I have thought of so far -  

1. I explored is to add myself to my partner's plan but if I put the qualifying event data as of March, the system tells us that this is out of the 31-day window in which we can register for a qualifying event. 
2. I started looking up insurance providers online and they are expensive and very confusing. Even after paying hundreds of dollars, the coverage is quite limited and the out of pocket is sky-high.

So I am looking for advice on the following - 

* Is there anything else I can do or explore in addition to the above options while I wait for the appeal to come back?
* Can I put in a date that is in the 31-day window for option 1 above? I am pretty sure the answer is no but I wanted to check anyway. (I am kinda desperate here).
* Any resources/companies/plans that offer decent coverage at reasonable prices if I want to buy something in the interim or heck, even for the rest of the year in the worst case? 

Any pointers will be super appreciated. Again, stay safe and healthy people!","Accidentally removed myself from employer-provided health insurance plan (California, Santa Clara county)Hello everyone! Hope you and your loved ones are well and safe.

t3_gijgoh,personalfinance,is this an appropriate use of a credit card chargeback?,"Our wedding for early May was cancelled due to COVID. Our venue was a restaurant that has been closed by the stay-at-home order of our city. We had put down a $2k deposit in March and asked for it back in April and May. After several emails and a long delay, the restaurant told us they'd refund our deposit but couldn't issue it until they open back up. 

Given the uncertainty of the stay-at-home order's undefined end as well as the shaky restaurant industry, I'm worried that they may try to hang onto the deposit for months more, or at worst, go bankrupt and we lose the money completely.

t3_gijeue,personalfinance,Is it better to buy a house (And acquire debt) or have savings in your account? Please advice.,"Hey everyone, sorry for throwaway but I don't like mingling my personal/important business with my main/chilled account.

My family has sold an appartment and has about $127K in the bank from the sale. We are currently renting a house at $1200 per month. We also have close to 0 debt as of right now.

My mom wants to buy a house for around $160k and take a loan from the bank, in our current situation the only actual income is hers. My brother and his girlfriend can put some money up, but because of the pandemic affecting his area of work I'm not certain he can keep it coming or for how long he can sustain it. I've also been affected by the pandemic circumstances (not sick lol thank god) and am currently out of a job. No savings in any case either.

My brother might have some but definitely not a whole lot. If we bought the house we would have around $300 left after the bank's monthly fee to be used for electricity, water, and such. We would have around $30 for food and shit and my (older) brother and his gf are expected to chip in to cover the costs as well. I'm also expected to chip in as soon as I can get a job. We live in a third world country so keep that in mind, food is cheaper I assume than in the US or Europe.

So we have two options, please help me choose or consider them:

**OPTION 1:** We can rent and keep our savings until me and my brother can get going again so we stop using the savings cause of our better situation and then reasess if its worth purchasing or just keep renting until we're secure enough financially to buy. 

**OPTION 2:** We can buy now and have a secure roof for years to come, but have barely enough money to actually do anything. If my brother's area of work doesn't recover in due time we might be in serious financial trouble (in my opinion).

**Please read this** 

In my mind putting ourselves in such a risky financial situation by buying a house puts us way more in jeopardy than having savings in an account. It also allows us to take advantage of the pandemic by finding cheaper renting prices imo. 

The other point of view is that with the coming depression/recession, the economy will plummet, the dollar will lose its value and our savings will be worth shit by then so its better to spend on something tangible.

So, should we buy the house and get a loan or rent and assess in the future PLEASE ADVICE! Thanks. :)","Is it better to buy a house (And acquire debt) or have savings in your account?

Her Salary: 75k
My Salary:100k  

We are looking at a 200k house with 10% down. PMI would be about $40 per month until we reach 20% (this has been verified by lender due to credit, etc.). Overall its well below our means.

Our current rent is $1600 per month, which is the going rate for the area. If we purchased a home, we would be looking at ~1k with taxes and insurance. A saving of $500 per month.

Prices don't fluctuate here like in CA (+/- 300k). And the location we are looking at has no history of flooding and FEMA classifies as low risk.  

The only negative to this situation is my job is rocky. Our monthly expenses are around $3k. We have 40k set aside for emergency (not utilized for house).  

Her job covers all the bills, and I think $500 less in monthly expenses is a plus. I understand homes have additional cost (I've owned 3 before now - we used to move a lot but now settled). However not $500 per month extra. It will also help with taxes. We currently have nothing to write off.

t3_gij3jm,personalfinance,Salary vs contract W2 (not 1099...I think). Assessing the difference...,"I've done some thread searching and still a couple quick questions about this role that says ""90/hr on W2"".

Since they say W2, that means this is not a 1099, and thus I unfortunately *cant*use this tool to figure out which one pays better, correct?

https://www.viewthenumbers.com/w2-vs-1099

Second question: aside from the higher income tax % since the salary is so much higher, I also need to pay an additional 7.5% FICA tax, correct?

I added up all the stuff my employer contributes and its 1075/month after converting PTO to $. Including the annual bonus its $2300/month. 2300*12 = 27,600.

Does that mean to compare the two job offers, I should just add about ~28k to my current salary, and compare that to the annual W2 salary after taking 7.5% off due to the extra FICA (or is that only for 1099s?), then remove the extra income tax I have to pay due to the higher salary?

I could open a traditional Schwab brokerage account to cash out my MR points.  Another option would be a ""Cash Management Account"" which on their website was described as ""A brokerage account earmarked for everyday spending"" which I'm guessing is just a glorified checking account - it says it offers an ATM card.  With all of the market volatility currently, would it be smarter to just convert my points to cash and then transfer to a HYSA? (I have access to promotional checking/savings accounts which could yield 5%+ APY)  I guess the alternative would be to invest in the stock market perhaps dollar cost averaging to reduce the risk of ""buying high.""

Another option would be a ""Cash Management Account"" which on their website was described as ""A brokerage account earmarked for everyday spending"" which I'm guessing is just a glorified checking account - it says it offers an ATM card.  With all of the market volatility currently, would it be smarter to just convert my points to cash and then transfer to a HYSA? (I have access to promotional checking/savings accounts which could yield 5%+ APY)  I guess the alternative would be to invest in the stock market perhaps dollar cost averaging to reduce the risk of ""buying high.""  

I have no imminent need for cash - my E-fund is loaded, no debt.

t3_giifxv,personalfinance,Random debt collector notice,"So today my husband (28) got a notice from a debt collector (affiliate asset solutions llc) that they had purchased medical debt he owed from June 01, 2014. This is only about $400 of debt. As this was six years ago he vaguely remembers having gone to the hospital around that time but isn't sure. At the time he was on his fathers insurance and he doesn't remember being charged for anything (he was on college and his father would have handled it since it was the fathers insurance). His father, bless him, doesn't keep records of damn near anything and hasn't been helpful.

The notice says we have 30 days from May 05, 2020 to dispute the debt claim otherwise the debt will be valid and they'll work to collect. Or something to that effect. However, on debt.org I see that most any debt over 6 years old cannot be collected. Do we even have to respond to this?

If I stay the course I should be able to pay off all three of these in the next year, but I'm thinking it would be good to target the car/school loan first.

t3_gihzt8,personalfinance,FHA Logistics: Rent or Sell?,"Hello,
As we know, life happens and the projected path you saw yourself taking one day can change the next.  In this case, having an FHA loan is complicating that.  We bought our house back in October, so a little over seven months ago.  According to the information I've been able to dig up, occupancy for the FHA loan is a minimum of one year.  I see there are some exceptions, such as job relocation.  However, all the articles I can find only talk about FHA allowing you to buy a second property with a second FHA loan.  Specifically, we are trying to find out if job relocation will allow us to rent out the property ahead of the one year mark.  Otherwise, our options are to continue to pay for another five months and making it appear like we live there and then rent it out, or selling it for a major loss.  
The house was bought at $153k with 3.5% down.  Monthly payments including taxes, HOA, insurance, ect are under $1400 (taxes in the area are super high).  Rental market for the house would be around $1600.  From what I understand this isn't the greatest margin and wouldn't leave room to use a management company, we'd have to manage ourselves or have family in the area take care of small repairs and coordinate any larger ones that arise.  The good part is, while it is a single family home the HOA takes care of all roofing, siding, and landscape.  So there is no risk of a high cost repair to the exterior of the home.  All windows were recently replaced as well.  Our main risk with the house itself would come from plumbing or electrical issues arising (or some massive, unavoidable disaster).
The other, obvious, option is to sell.  I know that we have basically no equity built up at this point.  Down payment is a loss and 10% to cover sales expenses would be around $15k.  We don't even have $15k to cover the sales expenses at this point.  We'd also probably have to put in about $3k-5k or so to make the home more appealing.  The previous owner did a shotty job painting the cabinets in the kitchen, the stairs, and the vanity in the bathroom.  This can all easily be stripped and stained.  The appliances are mismatched, but at this price point of a home I don't see that as a huge deal.  We would want to put in new carpet in the bedrooms, it's not in horrible shape but could use a facelift.  Also, the doors are the ugly builder grade brown and we would want to put in white to make it look more polished.  These are all things we would do before renting it out anyway to make it more appealing and possibly getting more towards the $1700 range for rent (still within market). 
I'm mainly looking for advice on what the best course of action would be.  We're leaning towards making repairs, ""living there"" for 5 more months, and then renting it out.  However, we're not super well versed in running numbers on real estate and maybe a different option makes more sense.","FHA Logistics: Rent or Sell?Hello,

So obviously Pornhub ran a now infamous 7 day free premium trial during the current pandemic. I'd never paid for porn in the past, and really I just got sucked in by the curiosity of what was premium about Premium.
So I signed up on May 1st 2020, and also agreed to the free trial for Brazzers at the same time. I cancelled Pornhub Premium on May 8th.
I did however forget that I had signed up to Brazzers.
Cut forward to today and I notice a recurrent charge on my bank account for almost £40. After speaking to a Probiller Agent on LiveChat they swiftly cancelled my account with themselves, however, stated that to make sure the charges did not happen again they would need to me to reconfirm the name and email address tied to the account. They also wanted the first 6 and last 4 digits of the Debit card used. 10 digits out of 16 just didn't sit right with me and I left the chat, ready to call the bank in the morning before I went any further.
Around 10 minutes later I received an email from the Agent I spoke to, with a Brazzers goodbye message which stated my username and password, that my membership had been cancelled, that I will continue to have access until my expiration date and will not be billed for this membership beyond that date.
The whole set-up for the LiveChat looked so dodgy, as if it had come from a 90s movie, and I just don't know whether this is truly issue resolved. I accept that it was stupidity, curiosity and intoxication on my part that caused this situation in the first place, I just want to make sure that this is end of story and I don't need to worry about another £40 coming out same time next month.

t3_gih6xp,personalfinance,ROTH IRA - Minimum vs. Max out,"I'm just beginning to set up my roth IRA, but I'm a bit confused about how the Roth IRA works when there are minimum investments, but there is the $6000 cap for contribution. 

For example, Vanguard has some index funds that require a $3000 minimum investment. Does that mean if I put down the minimum investment for two index funds, I've already maxed out my contribution for the year, or am I missing something?

A different scenario would be to put the $3000 minimum investment on one, but invest in another one later on once I save up another $3000. But if I am reinvesting every month (e.g. 100$ monthly) to the initial Index Fund, does that mean I can't invest in the second one until next year, as I would be over the $6000 contribution limit? 

I may just be fundamentally misunderstanding how the Roth IRA works, so any clarification would be appreciated.

If I take this option, I will $1275/m over the next year. I would also need to pack and hire movers (I'm on the 4th floor and the only one bedroom they have is on the 3rd floor of a different building).

**Option 2**: Stay in the two bedroom and find another roommate. This unit costs $1475/m (before utilities) total, which I am paying by myself for May. With a roommate, I only pay $737.5/m in rent. I still have to pay $1500 to have the bedroom repaired, which can be broken up into 12 payments. However, I can't have a new roommate move into the master bedroom until it's repaired. The carpet needs to be replaced, walls re-painted, and the bathroom counters need to be re-surfaced. The apartment manager doesn't know how quickly they will be able to get this done, or if their vendors are able to do work in an occupied apartment due to COVID-19. If they can't do it, I have to find a way to make that bedroom livable on my own... and I don't think I can. Finding a new roommate also puts me at risk for this to happen again. This roommate was the second roommate to abandon the apartment with out notice in the last 9 months. The roommate before had a mental break down and went to live with family. While this is understandable, I still got screwed paying his half of the rent for a month.

I am a full time student and I will graduate in May of next year. At that point, I will either be going on to grad school or I'll be working full time in my new career. Right now, I work for the university part time making $13/hr. I can't work more than 30 hours a week as a full time student, and realistically, I can't work more than 20 hours a week with out compromising my performance in class. I am supplementing my income with scholarships, grants, and student loans. I'm on SNAP and Medicaid as well. I budget every dollar in 6-month increments to align with financial aid disbursements in January and August. It's barely enough to cover CoL. 


TL;DR: Roommate abandoned the lease and now I have to pay $1500 to have her bedroom repaired before I can find a new roommate. I am also paying double rent until the room is repaired. The apartment manager is offering to let me transfer to a one bedroom which will cost $400/m more than splitting a two bedroom with a roommate. I'm full time student barely making ends meet. Should I stay in the two bedroom and find a roommate if/when the repairs are made or move to the one bedroom?

Edit: Based on upvotes, it looks like the majority says I should stay in this two bedroom and find another roommate. Thanks for the input and discussion, everyone. Cheers!","My roommate abandoned our apartment. Didn't pay rent, caused damages. Need advice on what to do next.I am in a pretty bad situation right now and I am looking for advice about whether I should stay in this two bedroom apartment and find another roommate, or if I should move to a one bedroom apartment in June.

What happened with my roommate: She moved out last week, didn't pay rent for May, and has left over $1500 in damages to the master. The full story is posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gaq19p/colorado_us_my_roommate_is_attempting_to_break/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gg6ezg/roommate_moved_out_with_no_warning_did_not_pay/).

I am paying her half of the rent today and I understand I have to pay for the damages to the master. I intend to take this matter to small claims, but it looks like it could take years to recover the money. In the meantime, I need help deciding what I should do.

t3_gigg8n,personalfinance,Rent vs. Buy in HCOL California city,"My wife and I are both 30 and live in a California HCOL city where the median home price is \~$625k.  We are both in secure government jobs and make a combined $165k gross. We'd really like to move from a 2+2 apartment (rented at $2k) to a single-family home sometime in the next 1-3 years and are hoping to get a downpayment saved up by then. However, we won't get to a 20% downpayment (\~$125k) for another 5 years. We just started our downpayment fund after aggressively paying down existing credit card debt and currently have a $10k downpayment balance with future contributions estimated at $2k/month.

My question is this: We'd like to take advantage of the State's CalHFA loan and downpayment assistance programs before we exceed the income limit (set at $170k for our county). Should we jump at the opportunity to enroll in the program now, or are we better off continuing to rent and building up our downpayment?

When I plug all relevant info into the NYT Rent vs. Buy calculator, it always churns out a number that is very similar to the rent that we are paying now, so I feel like we are on the cusp of seeking out homeownership.

Other things you should know: We have a fully funded 6-month emergency fund. We are maxing out our employer-sponsored retirement plans and Roth IRA contributions. I have $6k in student loan debt and estimate it will be paid off in 5 months. She has \~$90k in student loan debt, but she's also enrolled in the PSLF program and is a little bit over halfway through the program. My car is paid off and her car still has $18k balance on it.

I'm confused on how to proceed and would love some guidance.

t3_gigd4r,personalfinance,GAP Insurance...is it worth it for my auto purchase?,"So I am in the process of purchasing my lease out and wanted to get advice on how worthwhile GAP insurance is and when it is and when it might not be beneficial.

The car I'm buying out is a 2017 Toyota Camry for $14k and my KBB value lists the cars value within that same ballpark.  My CCU is offering GAP insurance on the loan for an additional $450 and I was wondering if it's worth it.  My loan is going to be for 72 months @ 3.39%, but I plan on making larger payments at the start to pay off the principal faster.  The only reason I choose a 72 month plan was because the APR was the same for every type of loan with my CCU so I figured I might as well have the lowest monthly payments just in case anything happens.  However, either way I'm planning on having it fully paid off within 2-3 years at the very most.

t3_giga2f,personalfinance,Should I physically save my tips or put them in my bank account?,"Hello, I (17f) work for a coffee shop. I receive tips weekly and will be going to college this fall. Saving money has always been a huge deal to me. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about my tuition or housing costs since I have received a full ride scholarship and will be commuting, but I still have many other costs that include gas, meal plan, textbooks and more. And, I've been debating how to properly budget and where to save my money.

However, despite me hiding it, there's a risk if someone breaks into my house and steals it and it'll just accumulate anyways and what would I do when my jar gets filled?

t3_gig8gx,personalfinance,Mom was evicted and owed $6k in back rent before ending up homeless. Does this end up in collections?,"So my mom was evicted from an apartment after not paying rent for like 5 months or something. She ended up being homeless for a month before I was able to buy her a ticket to come stay with me. (Just a quick rundown: she isn't mentally well, we have an extremely strained relationship due to her toxic behaviour, and because of her mental health she has pushed everyone away. Im the only idiot left behind to help, but this will be my last time).

Anyways she ended up owing $6k in back rent. I think they tried to ask her to appear in court but my mom doesn't speak English that well and was also well, homeless, so never got the order.

She left Hawaii to stay with me in California. I'm hoping to have her out of my place by August as everything as grown extremely toxic and unsafe for me.

Question is... If she were to return to Hawaii would she be arrested? Or what happens to that 6k owed? This is her second time getting evicted... The first time the owner didn't press charges and I somehow managed to convince my mom to apply for bankruptcy.

I'm hoping to find a room for her to stay as I don't think with her credit and history she would ever be able to rent an apartment again.","Mom was evicted and owed $6k in back rent before ending up homeless.

t3_gig35x,personalfinance,Automated in-plan Roth 401k conversion &amp; associated mega backdoor questions,"I recently learned that my employer's 401k provider was allowing automatic in-plan conversions of after-tax contributions to become Roth contributions. My understanding is that after I hit the $19,500 cap of pre-tax contributions withheld from my paycheck, I have the option to continue contributing on an after-tax basis. This automated in-plan conversion feature would then automatically convert them to Roth 401k contributions. All of my contributions to date have been traditional pre-tax 401k contributions. Does this mean that there would be a separate Roth sub-account within my 401k? How are the funds and associated earnings separated?

I have read about the ""mega backdoor Roth"" that allows you to contribute up to $57,000, minus employer contributions and minus the $19,500 of my own money already contributed. Is it this after-tax money that had been automatically converted in-plan to Roth that can be rolled over to a separate Roth IRA? What is the difference between keeping it in an in-plan Roth 401k versus a separate Roth IRA? I already have my own personal Roth IRA which I put $6,000 a year into. Is it this same Roth IRA I would be moving this in-plan converted 401k money into? They are both with Fidelity.

My employer does allow in-service non-hardship withdrawals but the SPD mentions there is a $20 fee for such withdrawals. Is a rollover to a Roth IRA with the same provider (Fidelity) considered a withdrawal subject to this fee? Is there any way to avoid this fee? If not, how often should I be doing the rollover in light of the fee?

I tried to increase the amount of $ to contribute after learning of these automated in-plan after-tax conversions to Roth, but the plan limits me to 30% of my paycheck across all sources (pre-tax, Roth, and after-tax contributions). I make $80k-$90k a year. Therefore, since my employer match is 4.5%, and I can only contribute up to 30% of my own paycheck, it seems impossible for me to hit the $57,000 max, right? But this method could at least help me save more than $19,500 per year of my own paycheck?","Automated in-plan Roth 401k conversion &amp; associated mega backdoor questionsI recently learned that my employer's 401k provider was allowing automatic in-plan conversions of after-tax contributions to become Roth contributions.

t3_gifvh9,personalfinance,TD dropped my credit score by 200 points due to an error on their side. Help?,"I pay my TD credit card bill in full every month via my TD bank app along with my other bills. It's part of my bill pay ritual. Apparently a recent payment that I initiated has a processing error. TD bank called me to inquire about a late payment, which I payed in full immediately and they assured me that it wouldn't be an issue and that everything was fine. A few weeks later I receieve a notice that my credit limit on my CC has been decreased several thousand dollars due to a late payment, and I see my credit score has dropped nearly 200 points (from \~820 to \~660). For the record, I've never had a late payment in since I got this card (or my other card), and I have no other outstanding negative issues with my credit.

I tried calling TD and the representative acknowledged that they have record of me attempting to make a payment on time that had an error, and that it was followed up by a late payment. They are telling me it's out of their hands because the report was already sent out to the credit agencies. I am waiting to here back from a ""supervisor"" but due to covid-19 related issues there is a several day queue for a call back. Trying to dispute the claim on Experian says that if the payment was eventually submitted, but was still late, there will likely be no change. I still tried to submit under ""other issue,"" but I do not have high hopes.

So is there anything I can do? 200 points feels like an insane drop over something like this. I was in the process of saving up for a down payment on a house and now I feel like my ability to get a decent loan in the next year or two is completely destroyed. Is there a way for TD to send an amended report and increase my credit back? I feel like a drop like this can take years to recover from. It's really devastating to be someone that regularly pays all my bills on time and get completely screwed over to an error.","TD dropped my credit score by 200 points due to an error on their side.

t3_gifgh2,personalfinance,"Where to put and what to do with a large, idle Savings balance?","Hi all, wondering if anyone had any recommendations on what to do with a moderately large balance of savings — upward of $25,000 and counting — that has just been laying around in a checking account for years. I wouldn’t really need to withdraw it until I place a down payment on a house in maybe 2 years time. But at the same time I’d maybe want it to be accessible in the event of an emergency.

I understand that there are some ‘high-yield’ savings accounts out there, that pay like 1.5% APY over the year...which i feel is a real negligible amount at the end of the day. There has to be a better place to park this money and earn more return on it. I already have a 401K so not looking to pour money into that (particularly because I’d want to have access to the money in the coming years)

Anyone have any recommendations or thoughts? Thanks kindly in advance. Any advice is greatly appreciated.","Where to put and what to do with a large, idle Savings balance?Hi all, wondering if anyone had any recommendations on what to do with a moderately large balance of savings — upward of $25,000 and counting — that has just been laying around in a checking account for years.

t3_giff13,personalfinance,Staying after giving notice or going to a job that pushed back my start date?,"So I’ve been a healthcare provider for a while now and my current job, first job, was created when the hospital did an audit and realized they were missing out/sending away patients because they didn’t have enough beds. The hospital I work for then created a unit and hired staff to fill this unit with 1/2 medicine and 1/2 specialty patients. Since I’ve worked there we’ve never really made the numbers or had the volume that was projected and it’s been really frustrating waiting every few months to hear if they would give up the specialty beds and make it all medicine, or if we would survive to work through another 3 month trial period.

I understandably felt really frustrated as I had a long commute and I  was working a job that I felt was temporary because of how uncertain our future was. Long story short, I applied and was offered a job at a major teaching hospital 15 minutes from my house. I would be working on a tight-knit team in a booming field of medicine. I gave my notice and would be leaving my first job on good terms. The hiccup came when, 2 weeks after I  gave my notice, the teaching hospital pushed back my start date by 2 months. 

I ended up talking to my current boss and they said they would do what they could to help get me some hours and keep me on the insurance for as much of those 2 months as possible. They also let me know that my leaving was a wake-up call and they completely restructured my current job and it’s actually a pretty good gig at this point. They have asked me if I’m sure I still want to leave.

My question is, has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you think it would still be wise to go to the teaching hospital after they’ve pushed back my start date (I’ve already sent in my credentialing documents)? I think one of my major concerns is that we are in the middle of a pandemic and if anything goes wrong with the new job I’d be screwed because now that they’ve offered to keep me after I’ve already given my notice I can’t just go back if I say no now. Hours and pay are comparable. The new job would be a shorter commute 15mins vs 50mins and closer to my family and where I would end up wanted to buy a house.","Staying after giving notice or going to a job that pushed back my start date?So I’ve been a healthcare provider for a while now and my current job, first job, was created when the hospital did an audit and realized they were missing out/sending away patients because they didn’t have enough beds.

t3_gies7l,personalfinance,Should I refinance my home to a 30 year and pay more per month towards principal or a 15 year?,"My husband and I are looking to refinance, but we can’t decide if we want to do 30 year or 15 year. Originally we thought 15 year for sure because we want to pay off our house as soon as possible, but due to the recent pandemic we were thinking if something happened and he lost his job, it would be way easier to come up with a smaller monthly payment. So then we were thinking, should we do 30 year and technically have a smaller payment, but then just get in the habit of making a monthly payment of like $2000(extra towards principal) while times are good, if something happened and he lost his job then we would only need to do about $1300 instead of $1883? But we don’t know if that’s a good idea or not. 

We plan on staying in this house at least for the next 5 years, but our long term goal is to eventually move and keep this house as a rental. So that’s weighing into our decision too. If we have a $1883 mortgage with the 15 year but we can only rent it out for like $1500? 

So we really need some advice on what would be the best decision for us. I think at this point we may be leaning towards the 30 year, but we wanted to get some advice before committing to a decision.

Is live in WA, and my company is based in NH.

First. My company uses a third party payroll system. ADP. Depending on how your company is set up if you use a third party for payroll they may also be your employer on UI’s system. So you work for company X but they use Company Y for payroll then your technical employer could be Y. Check that first. This turned out not to be my issues but it was a friends.

Second. WA’s UI dept sent my company a fax after we were deemed nonessential requesting information. Not an email, not a call but a fax. And they didn’t think to follow up after the fax so my status never left “pending”. So not only was nobody working but it was sent via a relic of past times. If you still have access to an HR or payroll department have them check for a fax. If they did get one they need to fax the information back and have them wait for confirmation.

Third. Most states you will qualify for food assistance. Their system is not bogged down nor is it over complicated. I applied on a Thursday, had an interview on a Friday and the EBT card by Tuesday. I got $350/mo (married, WA state) and a friend of mine got $150 (single, NV). We both are “upper middle class” (I mention this so you don’t assume you don’t qualify).","UI &amp; food assist BenefitsJust wanted to pass this along. I’ve been trying to get thru UI since March.

t3_gie21a,personalfinance,401(K) Setup Advice,"Hi Everyone,

I would like some advice on what to do when setting up my 401(k). My employer matches up to 6% so I was planning on putting in 6% myself to get the maximum match, currently this would be ~$550/month total including their match. I would assume this is the right move? I'm 26 years old.


What I'm wondering about the most is what asset allocation model / investment options to choose. Below is a link to what I believe are the pages relevant to what I'm asking about. 


Would it be wise to go with the ""Maximum Growth Model"" for a while considering my age and slowly move towards more conservative investment options? Should I go with the ""Managed Account"" or handle it all myself and just match the percentages to the maximum growth model when picking my investment options to avoid the managed account fees?

Since then, I’ve received final approval from the underwriter and everything is set for closing *except* for the stock and lease from my current lender (Chase).

US Bank has been trying to get a hold of them for weeks and Chase has been completely unresponsive. I also emailed the broker at Chase who sold me the mortgage originally and he has not responded either.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I’m at serious risk of losing out on my rate lock (it’s already been extended once) because of Chase’s inaction.

t3_gidq3b,personalfinance,Is now the worst time to get a house or the best? (USA),"My husband says no way while I see opportunity. 
Reasons to No 
--COVID 19 unemployment on husband's part, income is currently higher with +$600/wk  COVID benefits.
--we are blessed with an under-market-rate rental which we'd have to give up. House payment would be approximately 4x greater.
--This would massively deplete savings leaving us with ~$10k after transaction + another ~$8 in investments.
--Recession this winter is likely and could shake up our employment in unforseen ways.
--Change is scary, especially now

Reasons to Go
--House is what we want and where we want it.
--We've searched for over 1.5years to find the right fit
--We did inspections pre-COVID so we know the house is solid.
--Motivated seller's who already came down 30k on price making this a below market value bargan.
--Already spent ~1k on inspections for this place.
--House prices have so far remained stable and this lot (a few acres within commuting distance to an urban center) is likely to increase in value, even in a recession.

I'm encouraging my husband to enroll in trucking school while laid off so he has a recession-resistant income stream to support this purchase. He is concerned about public exposure risk and is pushing back but I think it's a good idea to invest in ourselves now, house or no house.

I'm essential and have continued to work throughout.

t3_gidmci,personalfinance,5% deposit on a house or save an extra three years for a 10%? (UK),"Background: my girlfriend and I are saving for a deposit on a house. We're currently renting, and saving around £350 each a month for the deposit. We aim to save just shy of £8k a year in total. I'm pretty new to how mortgages work exactly, so please bear with me.

My question is, is it better to try and get a 5% deposit on a house, put up with the poor interest rate during the initial term, and then remortgage; or wait an extra few years until we have enough for a 10% deposit?

My thinking is that the £11k we spend a year on rent could be going towards paying off the mortgage early... that seems obvious to me. Are there any downsides to this that I should be aware of? I know the interest rate is poor on 5% deposit mortgages, but if you can remortgage after 2-5 years anyway, why don't more people do that? Or is there something I'm missing?

Thanks in advance.","5% deposit on a house or save an extra three years for a 10%? (UK)Background: my girlfriend and I are saving for a deposit on a house.

I underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat it and I'm currently recovering. I used a GoFundMe and my savings to pay for my treatment but that money's all gone.

I have a Senior Analyst role at a big consulting firm and I went back to working part time and remotely. The job has great benefits and pays me pretty well. I get about $800 every two weeks working part time and then $2000 every two weeks working full time (starting in July). I don't have a lot of expenses:

- Student Loans = $371 / month
- Rent = $500 / month (I moved in with my parents after I got sick and this is how I help them run the house)
- Rent = $1500 (one time expense for the last month of my NYC apartment)
- Credit Card - $200/month

I was dumb before I got sick and never set up a 401k or a retirement fund of any kind. Frankly, when I tried setting it up the first time I got VERY overwhelmed and never bothered again. I don't know anything about them.

I just have no idea how to handle rebuilding myself. Once COVID blows over I'd like to return to the city, but I don't want to go back until I'm more financially secure.

t3_gid05j,personalfinance,Apartment saying I still owe after move out.,"Hey all, 

I moved out of my old apartment right before thanksgiving. Sometime in December I was sent my final invoice which said after they used my deposit I still owed $150 (cats messed up the carpet). I called the company that handles the apartments payment and paid on the phone with my credit card. Fast forward to January when I was paying my CC bill I saw a $150 charge to some strange LLC I had never seen before, looked into the company online and thought someone had got ahold of my CC and made the charge so I disputed it with my CC company.

About an hour after disputing the charge I realized that was the payment to my apartment and was a legit charge. I called my bank and they undid the dispute. However because it was a relatively small amount they had automatically approved the dispute and charged back the LLC. So now my CC statements show the following charges on the same day:
original charge to LLC for $150
refund sent back to me for $150
second charge to LLC for $150

The issues comes in that the LLC is saying I haven't paid them. They say all they see on their side is original charge being sent and then the original charge been taken back. I have sent them screen shots of my CC statements that show what I had outlined above and they passed it onto their finance team. At this point they said they are going to wait until the end of May to see if anything changes. 

My hopes are they are going to find the second charge and all is good. However on the phone they seem to be taking the approach that I still owe them money and if I can't prove I have already paid they are going to keep calling me.

What steps if any should I take to ensure they don't end up sending this to collections or what not?","Apartment saying I still owe after move out.Hey all,

I currently have 12k in my Roth IRA unallocated. I was thinking of swtsx, swisx, swagx, since that seems to be the consensus. I have also read that some people favor the swppx over the swtsx.

Second question is should I consider the ETF equivalents version instead to the index funds? Next question, I’m confused on the portfolio number ratios like: 80/20, 60/40 and how is that determined? Next question is how often should I rebalance the ratios and what should those ratios look like? Finally question is should I also look into REITs and International bonds for a further diversified portfolio, if so which ones?","Opened a Roth IRA with Schwab. Looking for advice.

t3_gicplw,personalfinance,"Defaulting on unsecured debt, trying to navigate tax owed, not sure of next steps.","Hello.  I've definitely been stumbling a bit financially the past few years and things came to a head this year.  I have about 50K in unsecured debt across credit cards/personal loans (all of which I have stopped paying the past few months).  Another 30k remaining on student loans (which I currently have deferred).  High unsecured debt is from a failed side business venture I had tried to keep going long after I should have let it die.  

I stopped paying because IRS told me I owed a large amount to them from 2018, and I'm currently trying to work things out with them.  

I currently make 75K in salary and get stock options, bonus, and other stock incentive payments.  My trouble with the IRS comes from all the stock income and my initial ignorance on how to handle the taxes on that properly.   I'm told I make too much money to declare full bankruptcy.  

I'm early 30's, I live in Boston, and partially support my partner as well.  We live pretty modestly, as much as one can for living in the Boston area.  Rent is still super high even with an old dilapidated apartment.  No family in the area, and they don't have money to spare anyway.  

I've been able to start saving a lot of money since I stopped paying the CCs/loan and put the student loans into deferment, I have about 15k of cash on hand, and could get another 50K or so if I cashed in a large chunk of my current stock holdings (80K minus what I would need to hold onto for taxes).  My hope is the IRS will accept a low monthly payment for what I owe them.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is what are my real options.  There is so much predatory ""help"" out there for people in debt, some of which I've already fallen prey to.  

I plan on getting my student loan payments back on track and getting squared away with the IRS.  Do I try to negotiate the unsecured debt in default?  Since it's unsecured, do I just write it off and basically lose any semblance of credit for another decade and deal with the annoyance of collections?  What are things I need to be concerned about from a position like this?  Garnished wages, jail time?  I feel like I can move forward successfully from here - it just seems like all the roads are so foggy and I'm all turned about.

I've checked my credit score and aside from one 60 day late payment (&lt;$10 balance, just totally forgot I had the card... my bad...), it seems my lack of credit lines are hurting my score/making the impact of the late payment much higher. Here's my credit history:

2014: Opened a card at local credit union

2017: Opened airline credit card

2017: Opened car loan

2018: Opened cashback card

2019: 60 Day late payment

So far only 3 credit cards, no other loans. Utilization around 2-3% at any time of roughly 30k limit across all cards.

After the late payment, my score tanked from 800+ and now is just above 650.

The initial credit pull will probably hit my credit a little more, but will the new credit card help get my score above 700 in the foreseeable future?

t3_gicl3m,personalfinance,"I don't feel like I have any right to negotiate right now, but I may have the opportunity (and of course I'd like to)"," 

Hello! I just graduated from college with a BS in Computer Science.  I've bee;n with my current company for about a year as an intern. At the end of last summer, I was offered 76K in a low cost of living area. I had planned to teach English abroad for a year for myself. I told my company my plans and they said that I could accept this offer and have the start date moved or I could stay an intern through the next summer and accept an offer then.

They said I'd be getting a new offer at the end of this summer regardless of whether I accepted this one, so I decided to reject it just in case other opportunities came up. Well, since COVID has hit, I'm not going to teach abroad, and I've decided to begin my career. All my coworkers have encouraged me to apply to other jobs in town so I can negotiate.

I've only gotten one response (probably due to COVID but who knows) and I had three interviews with different sectors within their company. From what it says online, the new company starts out at about 74K and doesn't have great 401K options. My current company's 401K options are about average for the industry.

I haven't asked my current employer to be promoted to full time yet. Since the new company's starting pay will likely be less than I was previously offered, I'd likely have to ask them for more before asking my current employer for more. Because of lockdown and me basically having to ask for a promotion at my current company, I'd love some advice for handling this in the most professional way possible.

t3_gic0c4,personalfinance,Proceeds from house sale - best 2 year investment?,"Hi, 

We're closing on our house this week and will have around 60k in proceeds that we want to hold on to for 2 years while we wait for the covid to settle down before we buy a new house in a new location. 

We're looking for the best no risk option for a relatively short term investment because we don't plan on touching this money at all unless something catastrophic happens. 

From my basic research it's looking like the capital one 360 performance account that offers 1.5% with a free $500 bonus looks like the best option for us, but would love to hear from folks who might be a bit more savvy than we are.

t3_gibqg6,personalfinance,Linked Fidelity Account?,"Hi there! I have a rather strange question.

I recently started my first real ""Adult"" job, and with that I will be starting a 401k through Fidelity. To help us younger members get acquainted with Fidelity and the current market, my employer/Fidelity are offering a virtual training session today at lunch. When I went to register an account and gain access to the training session, I had to input in all my person information - name, birthday, social security number - and I got the alert I already had an account. I couldn't remember if I actually did, so I clicked ""Reset Password"" with my same credentials and instead of me popping up, my abusive and estranged father popped up. He has his cell number and email listed when I attempt to reset my password.

I have not spoken to my father in 8 years and never plan on speaking to him again. Why would his contact info be there? A few years ago he tried to illegally claim me on his taxes and I had to personally call the IRS to explain that I had been filing independently for years and not been a part of his life.

Long story short, I don't trust him at all and want to report him if this in fact illegal. (Side note: I contact my employer who is contacting Fidelity and telling them to lock my account down).","Linked Fidelity Account?Hi there! I have a rather strange question.

t3_gibnjj,personalfinance,High Yield Savings Account Fiasco,"This is more of a rant, but I still wanted to share because it's hilarious and you can laugh at me. And then hopefully I can get some insight on easier ways to do this in the future...

Objective: Move a semi-large amount of cash from my savings (Growth) account with PNC (.15% APY) to a new Capital One 360 High Yield Savings account (1.5% APY). There was a promo for a $100 bonus **for every $10,000 deposited within 10 days of opening**. The amount I wanted to move is $30,000. Normally I wouldn't really care, I know the HYS rates are probably going to go down any day now, but I figured why not take advantage of the ""free"" $300 in bonus money and hang onto the higher APY as long as I can.

Here is what I did:

* Day 1 Friday: Got set up on my new CapOne 360 Account. Added my wife as a joint account holder. Easy Peasy. However, hindsight being 20/20, I should have opened this account on a Monday and not a Friday night. Possibly an issue later on with the 10 day funding period.
* Day 2-3-4 Saturday-Sunday-Monday: Set up my external account for CapOne360 at PNC for online transfer. Wait for the two small deposits to verify the account link. I see them on Monday and verify the account.
* **Problem: Daily external transfer limit with PNC is $15,000, Monthly Transfer limit $25,000.** Shit\*\*.\*\* I now realize that I will not be able to use this method to get the $300 bonus I wanted, and at most I could only get the $200 bonus with this method. I really should have looked into limits before hand, but it never really crossed my mind. Oh well.. let's call PNC.
* Day 4.5 Monday: Call PNC and go through the telephone wire transfer service. The guy on the phone talks me out of doing it over the phone because a.) I have never done a wire transfer over the phone with PNC before and I need to fill out paperwork with them b.) it will probably take about 45 minutes to 1 hour on the phone with him to get it set up. He says if there is a local branch near me that I could do a drive-thru wire transfer during the COVID stuff. Since I did not have an hour at that time to work with him on the phone I decided I would try going to the branch drive-thru. I call the only branch that's a reasonable distance to me and they did not answer the phone.. sigh.
* Day 4.75 Monday evening: Well this day is shot. So I initiate a transfer to my new account for $15,000 just to get something going in case I can't get it all there within the 10 days. Knowing there is a daily limit, I then schedule a $10,000 transfer the following day getting to my maximum $25,000 monthly transfer. Then I write a personal check to myself for $5000 (Daily CapOne Mobile Deposit Limit) and do a mobile deposit to my new Cap One 360 account. This part actually worked the smoothest.
* Day 5 Tuesday: **Problem: PNC emails me and says my $10,000 transfer has been canceled because it exceeded my monthly limit**. DUH.. I have other transfers/bills scheduled to go to external accounts regularly. Completely forget that would eat into my monthly limits. Now I'm thinking, the personal check worked so well.. I'll just write 2 more $5000 checks to myself and deposit them in the app. WRONG. **Problem: $10,000 mobile deposit monthly limit with CapOne360**. So at most I could do one more $5000 personal check to myself this month and have to figure out an alternate way to get the remaining $5000 to my new account before the 10 days is up.

Summary: I took a relatively easy concept, and I thought I could save time by doing stuff online. If I would have done my homework I would have gone with the paperwork route and the hour on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I did one more personal check, and was able to schedule a $5000 delivery out of PNC to cap one 360 for tomorrow. Keeping under my $25k monthly cap. Unfortunately I'm still within a 24 hour window of my last mobile deposit.. so more to come on that if I can deposit it tonight.

The other question remains.. ~~will everything clear by the 18th to get my $300 bonus. I'm betting not.~~

Edit 2: I confirmed with Capital One 360 that as long as the initiation of the transfer is done before the 10 days then I'll be ok.","High Yield Savings Account FiascoThis is more of a rant, but I still wanted to share because it's hilarious and you can laugh at me.

t3_giblks,personalfinance,Inherited additional monthly income by way of a mortgage on a sold commercial property,"Hi there. So i read the wiki and really didnt know where this fit.

Per the title, the family trust created by mu grandfather revolved around a large piece of commercial property which was just finally sold to one of the current tenants. He took on 20-year mortgage instead of paying cash up front, and because of this, the inheritance to all of the family members went from being an expected windfall to a monthly sum paid out over 20 years.

For my situation: I am 37, making $135K/yr, with an established emergency fund, a roth IRA (never maxed on any year), and a 401K that has sat dormant for 2 years.

I have a checking and savings (used as my emergency fund) account with a single bank, some, my IRA with Vanguard, and some trivial investment stuff.

My not-well-defined plan had me thinking id use the windfall inheritance to buy a house, but now that its no longer a windfall, im not really sure what to do to best accommodate that kind of plan. Should I open an account at a new location and just keep dumping this new income into there? Should I maybe just consider it part of my current salary and forge ahead with bolstering retirement funds?

Im sure any answer “depends,” but basically despite having an emergency fund and a good amount in my checking, I dont have any money especially “saved” for a down payment on anything.

Thanks for any help and or redirection to helpful material!","Inherited additional monthly income by way of a mortgage on a sold commercial propertyHi there. So i read the wiki and really didnt know where this fit.

t3_gib850,personalfinance,Choosing between Traditional/Roth 401k,"I know there are multiple posts about this and an entry in the Wiki, and I've read them, but I'm still not sure what the best option is. Consequently, I've created this throwaway -- in order to be quite specific about my financial details -- in hopes of getting a more clear answer.

I make $120,000/yr pre-tax, and my employer contributes 10% of my annual salary to a traditional 401k on my behalf each year. I currently max my yearly contribution limits into a Roth 401k (separate from my employer contributions, which as I understand, do not count toward my limits).

My wife makes about $40,000/yr pre-tax as a public school teacher. She thus contributes to a fixed-benefits pension and additionally contributes $12,000/yr into a 457(b). 

We both max our yearly Roth IRA contributions ($6000 each).

We are thus currently at the very high end of the 22% tax bracket, and likely to break into the low end of the 24% tax bracket in the next few years, and so the extra AGI adjustment from deducting retirement investments is unlikely to do too much there. 

Until now, I have been operating under the assumption that it's not a bad idea to invest into a Roth 401k until I'm in my 40s, at which point I thought I might switch, but doing some research more recently, I've found that it's often recommended to go for a traditional 401k when you're in a higher income tax bracket.

What would you guys recommend?

Consequently, I've created this throwaway -- in order to be quite specific about my financial details -- in hopes of getting a more clear answer.

I make $120,000/yr pre-tax, and my employer contributes 10% of my annual salary to a traditional 401k on my behalf each year. I currently max my yearly contribution limits into a Roth 401k (separate from my employer contributions, which as I understand, do not count toward my limits).

My wife makes about $40,000/yr pre-tax as a public school teacher. She thus contributes to a fixed-benefits pension and additionally contributes $12,000/yr into a 457(b).

t3_gib4gp,personalfinance,"My Mom Got an Updated Card, but I just Made a Payment with her Old One (SLU)","Hi, I'm 19 and very green in the ways of finance, but I'm concerned my mom may have accidentally opened a new card. Her bank recently issued an email announcing that they'd be changing to chip cards and that the original card would no longer be supported. She now has a new card with a completely new number, and a new code on the back, which seems suspicious to me, because if it were simply a replacement for her last card it'd make sense to just replace the same credentials with the chip card and destroy the old one. So now she has 2 cards with 2 different numbers, and she told me that the previous one was already cancelled.

Except I just paid for a phone with her old card. Don't worry, we planned for it together, but the thing is, it went through. She insists that her card has been cancelled since she had to replace it and that the payment must not have gone through and I'm missing something (par for the course with her) but I'm very concerned that the bank tricked her into opening an unwanted second card. I don't know too much about this to be sure, and my mom is very certain I know less than I do know, but I wanted to ask someone if it's a possibility, because short of being able to check her account myself, I don't think I can figure out why a payment went through on a cancelled card.

t3_giat3f,personalfinance,Suggestions: Voluntary Separation Package,"My company recently is offering a rather interesting Voluntary Separation Package due to COVID-19 and cost cutting. The package is:

- minimum of 45 weeks paid to all employees that take it - no matter how long you worked there.  
- 100% full prior year bonus
- 18 months employer subsidized medical coverage under cobra 
- 6 months outplacement assistance (initiate within 1 year)
- 100% vesting of retirement plans

The last day of service would be November 2nd so you practically are finishing out this year with a job. Which I think is a big factor when seeking next employment, hopefully economy will be better early 2021. 

If there is not enough participation in the package then they would result to involuntary layoffs which would be roughly 60% of the current offer’s value. 

I have been there for 6 years so based on the package I would be paid out 51 weeks of salary (almost a year) plus my bonus equal to the amount I received this past March. 

Things for me to consider:
I am in my late 20s with various security licenses that I feel like I could land a job fairly easily. Ironically I have been interviewing outside with a company already that I think I would be getting an offer but they are waiting for their building to open back up versus start me remote. But if their start date is earlier than probably October and then I would not get the package leaving early. 

I currently have one rental property with a long term tenant and I offer AirBnB on the other rooms. He lost his job at the beginning of covid but now has a new job. He is behind on rent 1 month but should be able to catch up now that he is employeed. 

I am closing on a new primary home end of June.

t3_giagx1,personalfinance,Is it possible to re-purchase an item from an auction website to extend its warrant using credit card extended warranty?,"Hi,

Just curious about this as I was researching about credit card extended warranties. Basically let's say you bought an expensive computer for example $10k, but realized you didn't use the correct credit card. In this case, I don't know if the seller would refund the CC and put it on another card, but let's say it's via Amazon.

In this case, is it possible to list the item in an auction website as a seller and then buy it yourself as a buyer to charge to the CC that you want this charge to be on, so that when/if something happens to the item down the road, you can use the last CC's extended warranty?

Is this possible? Do CC insurance companies thoroughly check serials, manufacturer website's actual purchase dates, recorded dates, etc?

If I am not wrong, if you didn't register the computer, there is no way to know, so just showing the receipt from the auction website should show that you exceeded the manufacturer's warranty, no?

Because I see that some credit cards outright exclude computers, and some others include them as well as auction websites like ebay. Any ideas on this issue?

Thanks in advance.","Is it possible to re-purchase an item from an auction website to extend its warrant using credit card extended warranty?Hi,

Just curious about this as I was researching about credit card extended warranties. Basically let's say you bought an expensive computer for example $10k, but realized you didn't use the correct credit card. In this case, I don't know if the seller would refund the CC and put it on another card, but let's say it's via Amazon.

t3_gia7u9,personalfinance,"203(k) fallout, what to do with the excess from the loan?","Hello!

Throwaway because I don't want people knowing my main's financial stuff. TL;DR at the end.

~Prelude
So, recently (as in *immediately* before the COVID outbreak in the US), I broke down and finally purchased a house, because I was getting tired of rental problems. After searching for a couple (6+ months), and getting financed at a decent at the time (3.65%) rate, I found a house I wanted (HUD @ 136k), submitted a reno list (part of a 203(k), the ""official"" estimates came in around 30k, had to set aside some for inspections and stuff and I had to slush a percentage, so let's call it an even 175k). Wasn't a terrible deal overall, because it immediately appraised at 200k, even before the renovations. The contractor is a personal friend of mine, so we came in *well* under budget. Like, total costs were 16k out of 30k. Doesn't help that we had to use HUD guidelines for prices, which are absurd. Bank didn't like that, so with the HUD consultant's help (which is a necessary evil in these kinds of projects), we submitted some documents that take the full loan amount out and I get a check for the balance (14k).

~Info on my debts
For the down payment, I took out an FHA loan, and borrowed some money from my 401(k), which I contribute fully to every year. This loan is almost paid off, and has no interest rate.

For a while, i wasn't great at finances, and I'm trying to get better. Had a while where I had to credit card, with no emergency fund. I owe approximately 12k on them, the interest rates are fairly high (22.99% - they're both cash back cards)

I've been paying on my student loans, slowly but grinding them down. I currently owe about 16k (6.8% interest rate) on them total.

I'm leaning towards paying off the credit cards and throwing the balance on the student loans. Is this the right idea? Or should I pay a chunk of the CCs off (maybe down around 20-25%) and put the balance on the student loan?

TL;DR: 203(k) loan (175k @ 3.65%) was botched due to nepotism, so I got money (14k) back from it. Put it back on the house, pay off the CCs (12k @ 22.99%), pay off the student loans (16k @ 6.8%), pay back the 401k loan( almost done - less than 6 payments left, 0%), or some combination?

t3_gia70e,personalfinance,"31, living in an expensive city, a bit behind in savings but making improvements -- realistic goal to buy/mortgage a house in 10-15 years?","Hi all.

I'm 31, working a low-mid level job in government making 61k in the DC area, with a hopeful promotion (fingers crossed) up to 75k after I hit the 1-year mark, and future promotions/job opportunities that I'll look for in the years ahead.  

Sometimes I get down on myself because I feel like I'm behind where I should be at 31-- income wise and savings wise.  Thankfully I have little debt (2k left in student loans, and I pay my credit card off every month) but I only got this 61k job recently, after being at 30k-52k for 5 years.  In that time, it was difficult to really save any money.

So here I am-- $2500 to my name, throwing 20% of my income into my savings account to generate an emergency fund, contributing the maximum I can for government to max my TSP (401k equivalent), and shooting for more career growth.  Once I have my emergency fund built, I'd like to start saving for a downpayment on a house and/or contributing to a Roth IRA. 

I know that I'm on an upward trajectory, but I can't help but look at just how much a condo/house would cost in the areas in-and-around DC that I'm looking at.  On the low end of what I'd love to have, we're talking 700k condos. I feel like it's going to take 10-15 years to save up enough for a down payment, let alone the 30-year mortgage that would follow.  Granted, I'm basing that off my 61k income and not the 100k+ I'd like to earn in a higher government position, so I know things will speed up.

Anyway-- I dont know quite what I'm looking for here on PF.  Maybe I'm just looking to validation that I'm thinking about things the right way, or maybe I'm trying to get a reality check that I'm not ready to start thinking about this stuff?  Any feedback is welcome.  

(Also worth noting-- I'm currently single and planning my finances as if I will be single.  Obviously, buying a house could change if there was a 2-income situation.)","31, living in an expensive city, a bit behind in savings but making improvements -- realistic goal to buy/mortgage a house in 10-15 years?Hi all.

Anyone else having this issue?I have an auto loan I’ve been regularly making payments on. In fact, it is my highest rate loan, so I regularly contribute 60% more than the min payment. I even made two additional (and sizable) principal payments when I received my yearly bonus in March and my stimulus check. However, when I check my credit, it says it was last reported Dec. 1, 2019. It doesn’t even have my December payment in there. As a caveat, I put “credit report” in quotes because it’s not my actual one—just a few free monitoring services. Credit Karma, Experian’s, my bank’s, and through AMEX (as I have a card through them)... they all show the same.

After paying off the other car payments and buying a car, that would leave me with about 10k. I would no longer have a car payment, and my wife and I would have vehicles that could last us years.

t3_gi766b,personalfinance,"To go abroad or stay home, weighing student loans","I'm currently graduating college with a humanities BA and some computer science work experience. My total student loan debt is 45k across 4 loans (most of which was the university forcing aid onto me, so I couldn't not take it to get other financial benefits), with an average interest rate of 3.2%. Currently the only gainful employment I have is freelance work, some web development here and there, and the potential to work with a company doing online media work for around 30k a year's contract.

Reality of the situation is that I don't make a lot, and due to physical limitations the place where I will be living is virtually inaccessible to me. The average wage is $10/hr, $40,000 a year if you're lucky (more normally $20,000), but the cost of going to and from places in Uber is routinely $40 one way. The math just doesn't add up. So I'm functionally stuck at home, even if our little Beer Virus friend wasn't keeping us all inside anyway. 

I have around 3.5k in bonds that are from the early 2000s that I can probably cash out or sell to cover 2 or 2.5k of the loans in the first year. Currently I make payments of around $100/mo when Sallie Mae sends emails saying I owe only something like $50, so at present I'm at least giving more than what is required to be paid. I know long term this isn't at all sustainable, though, hence why I'm considering looking abroad for work. 

The way the math seems to work out, if I can work in China or even a place like Vietnam teaching English for a year or two, I'll have earned a decent chunk of money coming in to where I can pay the loans off in 9 years or less. Most positions in China pay 2.5k USD/mo, with friends telling me they can easily live off of $1000/mo.. so after taxes throwing 800/mo at my loans doesn't seem unfeasible. 

At home my prospects seem very very slim. I'm not in an area that has a lot of tech/programming jobs, nor anything related to my BA, and I feel as though it will be a death sentence to go home and not do anything with my life, to be dependent on my parents because they retired in a rural area and I can't drive. For the time being I feel as though earning $2,000/mo (or even $1200 in a place like Vietnam) wouldn't be that bad of a situation combined with or even without my online work. In two years I either go for a Masters in something like Computer Science in Estonia where costs are low, or I somehow leverage my time spent in Southeast Asia to work in some NGO/Peace Corps position, and then grad school. 

TL;DR $45k in loans, average interest is 3.2%, very little prospects domestically so unsure about staying verses leaving for Vietnam or elsewhere abroad if only so there can be **some** positive cashflow rather than virtually none.","To go abroad or stay home, weighing student loansI'm currently graduating college with a humanities BA and some computer science work experience.

t3_gi922x,personalfinance,Should I keep this Metlife whole life insurance policy my parents set up for me in 1995? Or put cash value into ROTH?,"I am looking at a 5 year old document sent by Metlife for a ""Life Paid up at 98"" insurance policy my parents set up when I was a baby. First I need to find out and confirm that is a whole life plan and not a term life plan. I'm having trouble making the distinction. Seems pretty darn whole life to me.  Apparently they're still paying premiums into it. I don't understand it exactly/how it helps *me* down the line. 

Some details I'm seeing (I need to get myself into the account online to see current data, standby):

* Face Amount of Insurance: $30,000
* Annualized Premium $172.80 ($14.40/mo)
* Total Current Death Benefit: $31,182
* Total Current Cash Surrender: $1663

Now that I'm older and interested in making wiser financial decisions I'm looking at this and questioning the validity in keeping it. I am behind but recently got my Roth IRA Target Fund 2060 started and maxed it out for the year. I am currently unemployed and penny pinching, trying my best to make best decision with what dollars I have now for the future.

Obviously if I die I want my parents to be beneficiary of something. I can name them on my Roth IRA or maybe create a term life?

My question is this--&gt; I'm apparently *that* more or less ""deep"" into this Metlife policy. Should I liquidate what little cash value I can get out of it and dump that into my ROTH for 2019 or should I /my parents keep paying into this?

The whole concept of it confuses me. I know my parents wanted what's best as an investment for me and I'm not sure the Metlife plan, specifically, is it. But I also don't want to foolishly dump something I shouldn't. I have read much on here that these plans are gimicky at best, but not always. Not sure where I fall. Help me educate please.

I know this is for advice only, curious to hear back. TIA!","Should I keep this Metlife whole life insurance policy my parents set up for me in 1995?

t3_gi80dh,personalfinance,Rebuilding after abusive relationship left me with nothing...in a foreign country with kids,"(cross-posted to r/FinancialPlanning)

Hello,

Title sums it up. In my late 20's I had property, an investment portfolio, luxury hybrid, six figure income, savings, etc. I fell in love and moved to the EU. I didn't realize the person was so terrible with finances and his family continued to uphold his delusional bubble. The best I got out of his Sister when confronting her about knowing he was lying to me about finances was that it was because ""he loves you"". Cue the profanity.

Long story short, in the decade during the relationship I got lost. I had to sell my property, I lost my career growth and thus income earning and gains, and the country I am in (Netherlands) has limited financial services for US citizens. In the years that I was focusing on raising the kids, the Fathers retirement was meant to be for both of us, so I did not set up anything here on my own. I get very little from the Father, but have been able to save a little over the past couple of years. I need to make it work for me ASAP. I know what I used to do, but I was on a great path with property and earning compounded interest. Now I need to try and patch this up as soon as possible. It would be nice to be able to have the children still enjoy small local holiday's and such, but I recognize that the main priority now needs to be rebuilding my finances. Their Father earns very well, but is terrible with money, so he is paycheck/paycheck, behind on child support, and has debt of his own. I know he doesn't have any savings for them. I have a secondary goal of building a trust for them, in case something happens to me, so that they can afford to go and see their Family overseas annually.

I am open to any advice. I am very interested if anyone can advise on what is best with the dual residency issue and financial services available given the surface level restrictions. I don't know if I should set up a 529 (US College Savings Account/Program) for the kids, even tho it is likely they end up going to university here in the EU...

Thank you!","Rebuilding after abusive relationship left me with nothing...in a foreign country with kids(cross-posted to r/FinancialPlanning)

t3_gi8b0z,personalfinance,Dentist estimate was 130% shy of actual cost,"Located in California. I have really good high option dental insurance. No yearly limit, covers 100% of ""class a"", 80% of ""class b"", 50% of ""class c"", etc.

Dentist is in network and estimated my out of pocket expenses as $939.80. Actual out of pocket they are requesting is $2,146.60. Just shy of 130% discrepancy. Seems like a fucking scam to me. Insurance said they paid the correct amount and recommended I work with the dentist.

I am aware that I am responsible for the difference. I typically set aside 10-20% higher than the estimate to cover the usual discrepancy. I think this is fucking insane and unacceptable though.

I've reviewed everything for my estimate they quoted everything at ""class B"" where insurance would cover 80%. When actuality some of it was ""class C"" only being covered at 50%. 

What are my options?

How should I approach the office workers to get this lowered?

There is additional work that needs to be done and they would lose out on about 5k more worth of work, if they don't work with me at all. Might use that as ammunition but  don't want to overstep or be rude. I know they can't possibly know exactly how much my insurance will ultimately pay. I know it's my responsibility to get a pre-authorization, etc. I am genuinely offended at this gross underestimate of my out of pocket expenses though.

t3_gi7v99,personalfinance,Should I refinance my house?,"
I got myself into some financial trouble last year and racked up some pretty bad credit card debt.  Here’s a run down of all of it. 

19k ~18% interest
10.5k ~17% interest (a personal loan)
7.5k ~8% (a personal loan)
4k ~0% (promotional apr for the next year)
1700 ~ 16% interest rate

Right now I still have about 29 years left on the mortgage so restarting the 30 year process doesn’t really bother me. 
I owe about 374.9k on the mortgage still. Refinancing would add an additional ~$12k to the principle while reducing the interest rate from 4% to 2.875. This would lower my monthly payment by ~$210 a month and save $75k over the life of the loan.  Dropping the monthly payment on the house also allows me the opportunity to rent out the house without breaking even every month. 

The loan officer also says I would receive roughly 3k from my escrow and defer a monthly payment. Basically allowing me to use 5k to go straight to my debt. 


It sounds like a no brainer when the Loan officer explained it to me, but I’m trying to gather more information before I jump the gun. 

Pros:
$200 off my monthly payments (75k overall)
~$5k towards debt

Cons:
~12k added to my principle and another year added to my mortgage","Should I refinance my house?

t3_gi7k6z,personalfinance,You can add cash to your online only bank account by using the BlueBird prepaid card and there are no fees.,"I've noticed people occasionally asking how to add cash to online bank accounts when they don't have a brick and mortar bank to deposit cash for a transfer.  Also some online banks require you to link another bank account when you sign up just to make the first deposit. 

I just opened an Ally online bank account and I linked it to my BlueBird prepaid card. BlueBird is one of the best prepaid cards because it has almost no fees. It has no monthly fees and no fees to add cash at a Walmart. So that's how I put cash into my Ally account. I go to Walmart, deposit cash (no fee) onto my BB card and then just transfer the cash to my Ally Bank account. It's easy and cost nothing.

Note 1: The first time you'll need to link your accounts and this does take a few days for the banks to verify each other. First you use your online bank site to link to BB with the routing and bank numbers. 

Linking the other way is a little tricky because BB doesn't offer the option on its app. You have to use the regular BB online or mobile site and find the right links. 

First go to the BlueBird regular *online site* (not the app). 

When you get to the BB site click the three dashes on the top right corner. Then click ""settings"" and then  ""withdraw funds"" and then ""transfer to bank."" 

Note 2: It does take 2-5 days for money transfers after the initial set up.

Note 3: My friend used the same method to open a Radius online bank account which required a $100 deposit to sign up. 

I hope this helps others who are looking for an easy way to add cash to their online banking accounts.","You can add cash to your online only bank account by using the BlueBird prepaid card and there are no fees.I've noticed people occasionally asking how to add cash to online bank accounts when they don't have a brick and mortar bank to deposit cash for a transfer.

t3_gi6f89,personalfinance,Equity vs CC debt vs 401k,"Hi all!

Situation as follows:

 * $15k in CC debt, 20% APR

 * $4k in vested stock options that I have 90 days to purchase or relinquish

 * $12k in a 401k, option to pull out without a penalty due to COVID-19

Partner and I have shared finances. Currently awkwardly balancing my joining a (funded) grad program this fall, and their finishing med school this spring. By the time they start residency, our emergency fund will be down to ~$4k, and we'll then be ~$2k net positive per month, with the plan to dump that straight into med school student loans to keep interest down until I graduate and they finish residency.

Stock options aren't a sure thing - the start-up has a good runway and high valuation, but the next round will be led by a sovereign fund, which makes me skeptical that there will be any liquidity in the near future. 

My current plan is to pull from the 401k to pay off the majority of the CC debt since CC APR % &gt; stock market return %, and see if the company will buy back a portion of the vested shares and use that money to cover the purchase of the rest.

Am I missing anything obvious here? Should I try and refinance the CC debt before pulling from the 401k? Should I just try and sell all my vested options back to the company?

t3_gi5iin,personalfinance,My credit score went down from 705 to 675 and I'm confused?,"I am a 26 year old, I am not sure if that information is relevant.

Last month I applied and was approved for a Chase Freedom Credit Card. My line is $1500. The only reason I got the card was because I thought it would help boost my credit score, because it would dip about 30 points on and off after my student loans were paid off.

I am debt-free and paid off all my student loans in 2018. My score was around 720-730 and then dropped to around 680s before settling into 700s since then. However, I was not very good with my student loans - I had 6 loans and they were all delinquent (over 90 days late). I know that is not good, but I didn't know any better.

I understand that in 7 years those 6 delinquencies may drop, but before then what can I do to make the score higher? I want to buy a house sometime in 2021 or 2022 and am afraid of getting a bad ""deal"" because of a bad credit score.

I am not as knowledgeable as I want to be when it comes to finance things (I am still learning and know MUCH MORE than two months ago), so what should I do?

Based on Credit Karma:

I have 6 closed accounts (1 open, is that the cc?), 1 hard inquiry (for cc), a 13 year old account (I have an account with my parent and they authorized me as a person on their cc and it has no late payments... however, I have not used that cc since 2014, should I ask them to take me off of it? I was also thinking of closing that account with them and opening my own bank account, is that a smart idea?), 0 derogatory marks, 100% payment history, 4% credit use of $20 on a $500 line... but I don't know what line that is? I thought my line was $1500?...

Do I need to call people?","My credit score went down from 705 to 675 and I'm confused?I am a 26 year old, I am not sure if that information is relevant.

Last month I applied and was approved for a Chase Freedom Credit Card. My line is $1500. The only reason I got the card was because I thought it would help boost my credit score, because it would dip about 30 points on and off after my student loans were paid off.

I am debt-free and paid off all my student loans in 2018. My score was around 720-730 and then dropped to around 680s before settling into 700s since then. However, I was not very good with my student loans - I had 6 loans and they were all delinquent (over 90 days late). I know that is not good, but I didn't know any better.

t3_gi5i8h,personalfinance,Why are taxes different from one home to the next?,"Hi guys, I'm looking at buying a home in the Boise, ID area. When looking around I can't figure out why some homes say that taxes are $120/month and some homes go as high as $300/month. All the houses are around $300k that I am looking at and in the city itself (not connecting cities).

My grandfather said that no matter which house I buy either new or used that the taxes should be the same if the overall value of the home is the same and that when I see on Zillow or Redfin that the taxes are lower is because of what the current owner paid when they purchased the home.

Could someone help clear this up for me? Thanks!

t3_gi5e9g,personalfinance,(19) What would you do in my shoes?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi there! Currently I'm working full time making about $2200 a month while living at home. My main goal has been to increase my income but I am wondering how you would split up your savings in my position.

I have been aiming to save 800 per paycheck and have built and emergency fund of $5000. I was wondering how would you split up your savings? My plan so far has been, 400-500 per paycheck in VEQT, 200-300 for either building emergency fund more or saving for something like travel and the rest for misc expenses like bills and food.

I'm seeing if I am able to increase my income without school, so the only big expense I can see myself going into in the future is potentially a business, but have no plans of one in the immediate future.

I don't plan on moving out for a few years at least while I plan what I want to do for the future.

My job appears to be secure as sales have been meeting goals during the pandemic. As for growth, I work  at a  dealership so If I can improve sales I can leverage for a raise

Short term I'm looking to self teach coding and and other valuable skills in order to increase my income. Long term  I could see myself renting my own place.

I've been stuck between going for a degree and choosing to pursue a career without one.

Any and all advice or tips appreciated! Thanks for reading my post.","(19) What would you do in my shoes?&amp;#x200B;

t3_gi2mti,personalfinance,Bank says I owe them money from a fraudulent charge on my credit card almost 2 years ago,"Hello everyone, I know I should've done this sooner but oh well.

Some context: I'm a 22 year old university student and I live in Colombia so I guess everyone here can't do much to help me out with this, but I've read that there are some international rules that every bank must follow depending on the card brand, so maybe someone has those rules clear and can tell me if I can do something or not.

All of this started on October 3 2018. It was 8 pm and I was coming home from university in a bus, after I got on my stop, a guy basically kidnapped me for two hours threatening me with torturing/murdering me if I didn't do what he asked me to do. So I had to hand him my two credit cards, a VISA and a MasterCard that were offered to me because I was using my first credit card (the MasterCard one) responsibly, the VISA one had a topping of around 1000 USD at the time. 

The thing is, I hadn't used that card ever, I hadn't even activated it after receiving it from the mail, but the bank had a part in the contract for the card that said that it would be activated automatically after delivery if I signed the contract. Well, I had obviously signed the contract because I wasn't worried about it, I was thinking about having a good credit score in the future just using the cards responsibly, until I got kidnapped.   

So, after a lot of drama I managed to get out but I couldn't even file a police report (a great mistake, I didn't knew better then and my dad that studied Law didn't cared about reporting the crime thinking it would be useless, the worst part was that one of the band that kidnapped me was caught, but oh well), I blocked my cards and went to sleep. The next day I noticed that there were 5 charges to my VISA card that maxed the card, so I reported it to the bank and they said they couldn't do anything; even though I wasn't present, my card wasn't signed and the receipt of the purchase was never signed, the place where the purchases were made didn't check the customer's identity, the equivalent of my SSN was never compromised, and there were no evidence about the purchases being made other than what the bank reported to me. I'm pretty sure about this information because the bank itself confirmed it.

I want to know, is there something that I can do? I haven't been able to pay anything but I also don't want to unless it's absolutely necessary. Thanks a lot in advance.","Bank says I owe them money from a fraudulent charge on my credit card almost 2 years agoHello everyone, I know I should've done this sooner but oh well.

t3_gi4ksp,personalfinance,Mom was awarded disability settlement from VA. She’s in her early 60s with hardly any savings and zero investments. What are her options?,"Long story short, my Mom was awarded a backdated disability coverage from her time in the reserves where she was injured. There is a large, tax-free lump sum of money (~140K, the backdated) along with monthly stipends for the rest of her life (~4,000 or so with residuals). She will soon qualify for social security as well. She only works part-time and has for many years now. Her savings are low and she has no investments. On the bright side, she has no debt and lives incredibly cost-conscious. Her only expenses are rent (TBD since she is moving), food, utilities, and entertainment. She has asked me for her help in navigating her finances towards smart decisions. 

My first thought was for her to put her funds in a high-yield savings account and then open a Roth IRA and a bond-heavy portfolio coupled with ETFs. Not sure if there is anything more specific that I could suggest to her. Would appreciate any suggestions, it’s the lump sum that it is the hardest for me to determine what her options could be.","Mom was awarded disability settlement from VA.

t3_gi4kgi,personalfinance,Need some assistance as first time home buyer RE: Old Debt,"Hi Reddit!  I need a bit of help here.

back probably 8 or 9 years ago in my college days I had a terrible experience with Bank of America overdrafting my overdrafted overdraft and freezing my checking account.  I had a credit card tied to it  and was so frustrated with the whole situation I told them to kick rocks and they would never get a dime from me.  about a year later had a similar experience with American Express.   (2 accounts went to collections, I never paid etc.)

Fast forward to today, the only debt I have is a 20k student loan that has spotless payments, other cards are constantly paid down to 0 with no missed payments in forever.  I'm looking at getting a house now, and when talking to the mortgage company was told it would be tough due to ""2 bad marks"" and they suggested I try and settle the old debts.  I was under the impression they were so old they wouldn't matter?

When looking online about settled debt a lot of people say it's detrimental to your credit.  I know its not perfect but Credit Karma says i'm at a 744 credit score.  I am debating going to my Credit Union that I bank with to apply for a home loan but I'm worried the past debts will be an issue.  Should I call american express and bank of america and settle them beforehand?  If so how will that affect my loan process now?

t3_gi4cxl,personalfinance,Traditional 401K VS Roth 401k??,"Hey guys, I'm in my 20s and I make roughly 100k, before taxes. Currently I have a 401k with my job as well as a Roth IRA. I recently saw a post about this and it actually piqued my interest.

If my goal is to hopefully retire earlier than most people (aiming for 40-50), which type of 401k would I benefit more from? I anticipate eventually having some sort of side business income( not my occupation), to support me at that previously mentioned possible age range of retirement. However, I also anticipate raises in my salary if I continue to work in my field. But if the side business was bringing in decent income, I would probably go part time with my occupation or just quit entirely.

t3_gi1tot,personalfinance,Options for High-Deductable Healthcare Cost &amp; Recent Hospital Woes,"Hi Reddit — So the backstory.

During January I traveled to Las Vegas for a professional conference with work. Spent a week there all in all.. First few days were fine, very productive in fact, and met a ton of folk from all over the world. 

Fast forward to day four and I get a severe stomach bug while wrapping up the exhibition for that days outing. Sparing details, I retired to my hotel room for the evening and ingested liquids, had some plain food, etc. hoping that by morning it would pass and I could stay the course for the following day. I am able to get a few hours of rest and then *BOOM* I wake up feeling extremely dehydrated accompanied by body shakes, nausea, and lots of dizziness and confusion when trying to process. I attempt to figure out the best solution to the situation without panicking for a while. Bear in mind, I am in an unusual place at 1:30AM, so I ended up making the decision to call a taxi and head to the nearest hospital to get checked out for safe measure.

Fast forward to the waiting room at the Valley Hospital Medical Center and intake procedure – vitals come back generally okay, but they decide to run some blood work and pop an IV in to revive my shaken state and double check things in an attempt to validate why I am feeling so crumby. A comprehensive panel and a bag of fluid later and I’m being discharged with a sigh of relief and an Rx for Imodium (lol).

Upon checkout they let me know I could self pay for the sum of $783. Me being tired (3:30AMish now) and them not having processed my entire visit, I thought it to be wise to let insurance have a look.

A few weeks go by and then I get my EOB from Cigna. EIGHT THOUSAND and change dollars the hospital billed for this simple procedure. Sure, I went to the ER, but my jaw dropped. Now, they classified my visit as severe on my intake paperwork and I have already tried arguing this point with the billing department explaining I ordered a taxi, walked up to the counter and proceeded to have a full blown conversation with the kind aide checking my vitals on why she loved her VW Jetta. I’d say this is a grotesque overstatement. Anyhow, they’ve stuck with this. I’ve asked for a itemized list of all charges and have yet to receive said breakdown.

My deductible is $2,800 (in-network, which this hospital is for me) and I have an out-of-pocket maximum of $3,800. Based on how the hospital billed the insurance, they’ve basically negotiated with my insurance company for seemingly a maximum. My owed amount is $2,770.

I have submitted my charity application via email yesterday and have yet to receive confirmation of receipt. Billing staff say I have received my 60 day notice and it will be sent to a third party collections agency soon and “they highly recommend me to take on a payment plan.” I asked them if I paid in full, what discount would they offer. No dice as they explained “this is a deductible thing.”

Please help me to understand what options I have here (before we go down a one way street, filing bankruptcy protection is not a viable solution for me) and what would be the best course of action. Frankly, I’m shocked and appalled at how for profit our healthcare system is in the US based on this recent experience.

TL;DR: Visited hospital because I felt poor, received explanation of benefits in the amount of ~$8,000. Deductible brings this down to ~$3,000 for a blood test and IV via Emergency room. How can I resolve this expending the least amount possible?

Thank you.","Options for High-Deductable Healthcare Cost &amp; Recent Hospital WoesHi Reddit — So the backstory.

During January I traveled to Las Vegas for a professional conference with work. Spent a week there all in all.. First few days were fine, very productive in fact, and met a ton of folk from all over the world. 

Fast forward to day four and I get a severe stomach bug while wrapping up the exhibition for that days outing. Sparing details, I retired to my hotel room for the evening and ingested liquids, had some plain food, etc. hoping that by morning it would pass and I could stay the course for the following day. I am able to get a few hours of rest and then *BOOM* I wake up feeling extremely dehydrated accompanied by body shakes, nausea, and lots of dizziness and confusion when trying to process. I attempt to figure out the best solution to the situation without panicking for a while. Bear in mind, I am in an unusual place at 1:30AM, so I ended up making the decision to call a taxi and head to the nearest hospital to get checked out for safe measure.

Fast forward to the waiting room at the Valley Hospital Medical Center and intake procedure – vitals come back generally okay, but they decide to run some blood work and pop an IV in to revive my shaken state and double check things in an attempt to validate why I am feeling so crumby. A comprehensive panel and a bag of fluid later and I’m being discharged with a sigh of relief and an Rx for Imodium (lol).

Upon checkout they let me know I could self pay for the sum of $783. Me being tired (3:30AMish now) and them not having processed my entire visit, I thought it to be wise to let insurance have a look.

A few weeks go by and then I get my EOB from Cigna. EIGHT THOUSAND and change dollars the hospital billed for this simple procedure. Sure, I went to the ER, but my jaw dropped. Now, they classified my visit as severe on my intake paperwork and I have already tried arguing this point with the billing department explaining I ordered a taxi, walked up to the counter and proceeded to have a full blown conversation with the kind aide checking my vitals on why she loved her VW Jetta.

A) She continues to pay 50% of the annual taxes, but since she does not use the house I will pay my half of the taxes, and all of the utilities and upkeep etc. This way she still has an equity stake in the house.

t3_gi3pd5,personalfinance,What to do with extra $20k from home equity loan?,"TLDR:  I have $20k left over from a home equity loan.  What should I do with it? Return it? Invest it? Or something else?

Background:  50 years old, married, empty nest (adult children have moved out).  Purchased home for cash 5 years ago.  Spent the last 5 years working on it a bit at a time.  Got tired of how long it was taking.  

In February 2020 I got a home equity loan for $80k at 4% over 15 years.  Should be paid off by the time I can retire at 65.  

Spent $60k of the $80k loan paying off all other debt and making improvements to the house.  At the time (pre-coronavirus) the house was appraised for $160k, so loan was roughly 50% of equity.  (Now Zillow says it's around $145k, which doesn't include improvements.)

After paying off credit cards, my credit score went from 641 to between 730-760 depending on which agency you ask.  I've since applied for additional credit cards.  Got one from Chase with a $11k limit.  A few other cards raised my limit, when asked.  I now have $31,750 in available credit with none of it used.  Two cars are paid off.  My only debt is the $80k for the mortgage.

After clearing all debt and completing all planned upgrades to the house (windows, kitchen, appliances, flooring, etc.) I have $20k left over.  (I didn't budget for this, I just asked for $80k and received it.)  

So what do I do with the remaining $20k?

Do I repay it back to the mortgage company towards the principal?

Do I put it in savings?  The best savings accounts I can find are only 1.5% while the loan is 4%, so that doesn't make sense.

Do I invest it in stocks?  I see a bunch of long-time companies, like Disney and United, whose stock prices are at the lowest they've been in several years.  Do I invest it in those and hope they return to pre-coronovirus levels in the next 3 to 5 years and double my money?

Is there some other investment opportunity I should explore?

Do I blow it on booze and strippers?  Cuz I'm leaning towards blowing it on booze and strippers.

Happy to provide other info that may help.

t3_gi3fci,personalfinance,18-year-old looking to go independent,"Hi! I’m 18 and headed to the other side of the country this fall for college. I’m looking for help in becoming more financially independent.

Background:
My parents pulled all my money (around 2k) from my student bank account last year claiming that it would be harmful for college financial aid calculations, and I haven’t had access to anything since (although I haven’t had access to anything before due to being a minor). My dad set up some credit cards in my name last month but linked it to his bank account. I’d rather be able to use my own money, though, without them judging my purchases. 

Questions:
- Is my parents’ excuse BS? I’m not too well-read on college financial aid practices.
- Would I be able to walk into a bank by myself and set up my own account and credit card? (I’d wait until I got on campus because I’d want to use a chain that’s easily accessible.)
- Would I be able to change what account the previously made credit cards are linked to?
- Is there anything else that I’m forgetting? I’d like to have a concrete plan in hand so I can easily just pop into a bank one weekend in college and set things up.

t3_gi3601,personalfinance,"Scammed by a wheelchair company, CapitalOne won’t issue purchase protection","As of this past year, my partner uses a wheelchair for a degenerative neurological disease. In December, using his CapitalOne Quicksilver Visa card, we purchased a powered wheelchair online from a small company that was supposed to be amazing for getting around our home city. It was expensive, about $4,600, but would have been worth it for him to have more independence. We were super excited that he could finally walk the dog on his own again or go around the block without help for the first time in a year!

Unfortunately, the wheelchair as it arrived was faulty -- some crucial parts were poorly constructed, with the result that it was impossible to turn on and off and therefore completely useless to anyone needing a wheelchair. On top of that, it was clearly a REALLY dangerous device, not at all okay for anyone to ride safely. When my partner tried using it the first time, the wheelchair skidded around uncontrollably and erratically with a huge amount of force. My partner was literally thrown backwards out of the chair, heels over head, and would have been really seriously injured if he hadn’t been wearing a helmet -- as it was, he had serious bruising from the impact. The wheelchair then spun out of control and hit me, leaving me bruised for weeks. We had skid marks on our floor, and it nearly broke through our apartment windows! Suffice to say this was a super sketchy product, not safe for ANYONE, let alone someone with limited mobility who can’t jump out quickly. 

We then immediately tried to return the wheelchair. Now, according to EU consumer law, any product bought online can be returned for any reason within the first few weeks, AND also products must be refunded or repaired if found faulty in the first two years (with return shipping). The seller also has a return/warranty policy that guarantees against product faults and includes free return shipping. However, when we contacted the seller about needing a return, we got complete radio silence...first sketchy feelings that we got that maybe this was a scam :/ After trying over and over to get a response, we eventually shipped the wheelchair back ourselves ($250 shipping, it was heavy!), and filed a chargeback request with CapitalOne.

CapitalOne initially ruled in our favor after presenting the pictures, return shipping, etc., but last month suddenly reversed the charge because of a technicality. They claim that because we filed the chargeback *before* shipping the item back, it’s invalid -- though they never mentioned this originally. The same people also advised us to hold on to the original item and request an independent mechanic validate that it was faulty and dangerous, so we got totally contradicting info when filing the chargeback. The only reason we delayed shipping the item back was because it was pretty expensive, and according to both the seller’s policy and EU law, the seller was required to cover it.

So now the seller has both the wheelchair back AND our money, and CapitalOne and Visa aren’t following through on their purchase protection program. :/

This whole situation is especially awful given that the item in question is a wheelchair, of all things, and we’ve already had super high medical bills this year. It’s not an optional expense, and while we’ve been back and forth with the credit card company for months we’ve had to purchase another wheelchair for my partner to use. It doesn’t make sense that we no longer even have the item and don’t have the cash either. What do folks recommend we do in this case?

TL;DR: Got scammed out of $4500 because of a crappy wheelchair. This should have been covered by the credit card purchase protection program but it isn’t.

She's called Western Union, but the transaction has been complete. So I'm assuming nothing can be done there. 

She's also filed a claim with her bank, but I'm not sure that will be if much help. 

Is there anything else that can be done here?

t3_gi2612,personalfinance,"Destination Wedding Costs? (Outside of USA, preferably Europe)","I'm trying to start budgeting towards a wedding, and knowing my life goals (saving for a house down payment, saving for a potential future child, budgeting for my normal expenses in a High COL area), it seems like the most ideal wedding would be abroad (possibly fit the honeymoon and the wedding all in one). 

Having gone to a few friends weddings abroad (1 in mexico, 1 in germany), both have stated that it was extremely more cost effective than doing it locally. However, neither were really eager to share details in cost, and to be frank, I wasn't really privy to pushing the subject further. So I'm trying to get a realistic savings goal for the cost of a wedding abroad. We loved both of them, but Europe was definitely a better adventure for us specifically. 

So, strangers of reddit, anyone else who's been married abroad mind sharing their costs? Anything to think about specifically that you wish you had put more thought into before? Anything you wish you added to the ""package"" or something you wish you planned separately for? 

We do not plan to pay for airfare for guests, and plan to have 2-3 events with a party bus before and after the wedding, allowing for everyone to do their own thing if they wish. 

Thanks for the help!

edit: We like Europe, visited Prague, Munich, Salzburg, and love the vibe of the area and the ability to do things we normally wouldn't get to do in the NYC metro area. And we understand a destination trip is a big commitment, we intend to have people decline; that's sort of the point as well, to save money on the wedding.

Edit2: this is a budgeting exercise, people. This isn't a near term thing (read: will probably happen ~2023), so please leave COVID out of it. I haven't even proposed yet. And as for everyone saying ""OMG huge inconvenience"" that's sort of the point. We want to reduce costs at home, have a vacation while we're at it, and celebrate our wedding with those willing to make the trip.","Destination Wedding Costs?

t3_gi24l4,personalfinance,Vested RSUs: to sell or not to sell,"Hi there! I have a question for a friend who is not, in fact, me.

My friend works for a company that offers RSUs as part of his compensation. Let’s say he makes 90k as his base compensation but his RSUs are worth roughly 20k right now. These RSUs vest on the 31st of January each year and will be worth, at that time, whatever 200 RSUs are worth from the company.

We were chatting when he had a question about whether he should take out half his RSUs this year and pay off a credit card debt of 10k.

I know as his RSUs vest they’re included on his W2, but when he had his taxes done for 2019 he had been advised that since he sells the stock before he has had them for a year, he is taxed higher on them, but if he waits a year he can cash them out for capital gains instead, which is a difference of 24% because he’ll have less than 40k total in capital gains.

I went on investopedia to try to figure this out, since to me that sounds like he’d be double taxed, but I couldn’t figure out what we were even looking for, though I did read the entire article on RSUs and Capital Gains as well as looking at what tax bracket he’d be in. I did ask the guy who did his taxes but he was high and playing Smash, so I encountered some miscommunication.

Anyway, the core of the question is “is it worth it to save 15% APR on a 10k credit card balance by cashing out RSUs that vested January 31st this year?”

If someone wants to ELI5 how this entire thing works I’d be much obliged, but I’m also content with a yes/no answer to the main question.","Vested RSUs: to sell or not to sellHi there! I have a question for a friend who is not, in fact, me.

t3_gi1j73,personalfinance,How does Escrow work on a home mortgage? - ELI5,"I'm about to refinance from a 3.75% 15 year loan on a house I bought last March.  I locked in a pretty good rate last Friday of 15 years at 2.375% (2.788% APR with points etc.).  I didn't realize at the time that the rate was assuming I would set up an escrow account.  I currently do not have escrow account and just pay taxes/insurance once a year on my own.  I tried to see if they would just remove the escrow from my loan and they said they can do this but it would increase my locked in rate to 2.5%(2.836% apr).  They apparently allow me to change to any type of loan on the day I locked in but for whatever reason the rates are higher without escrow.

I would prefer the lower rate, but I honestly don't fully understand how escrow works.  I know that I have to pre-fund the account to cover taxes/insurance so there is an upfront cost for that.  Also, I will have to pay extra each month to essentially cover the taxes/insurances costs divided by 12 instead of paying it in full once per year.

From what I understand, the big penalty of an escrow account is the fact that I have to leave a decent chunk (maybe 3k in my case) locked up in this account that probably doesn't pay me any interest.  Is that the gist of it?  Do they generally charge fees to set up and maintain these accounts in addition to the penalty of holding this much money in limbo?  I'm trying to decide whether it's worth it to take the lower rate and deal with escrow or if I should take the slightly higher rate and pay taxes/insurance at the end of the year as I do now.  I would love to hear what you all think.  Thanks.","How does Escrow work on a home mortgage? - ELI5I'm about to refinance from a 3.75% 15 year loan on a house I bought last March.

Luckily there haven't been too many contributions to it.  I want to make sure I'm not missing anything and losing out on more by closing it out than keeping it. 

It was purchased when my grandma was 61. At the time she quit smoking but has since started smoking again. She is now 70. This seemed like something important to point out?

* Coverage Name: Universal Life 
* Face Amount\*: $30,000.00
* Current Interest Rate Credited: 3.20 % 
* Maturity Date: May 10, 2071 
*  Accumulation Value: $3,025.02 
* Surrender Charge: $1,144.50 
* Current Loan: $0.00 Interest Rate: 8 % 
* Maximum Loan Available: $1,734
* Net Cash Surrender Value: $1,880
* Planned periodic Premium: $279.00 

From what I' understand, we've contributed 8 payments of $279 = $2,232, which has grown to the cash value of $3,025.02? If I were to pull out all the money from this account, would it just be cash value minus the surrender charge? $3,025.02 - $1,144.50 = \~$1,881? 

Am I missing something here? I am new to all this, please let me know if I'm misunderstanding. 

Thank you.","Is Universal Life Insurance Ever a Good Idea?

t3_gi1a65,personalfinance,"Father put me on his line of credit when I was a child with no consent to me, I have an amazing credit score, but can’t do anything with it.","     I randomly discovered at age 20 that my father had put me on his lines of credit at some young age in life. I went to go do my taxes for the first time by myself, and turbo tax had added their credit reporting tool at the end, and it popped up on my screen that I had a 789. I was pretty dumbfounded, considering I had never taken out a credit card or a loan in my life. Looking at the credit report, I saw that my lines of credit were two lines of credit that my father has in his name. My credit history goes back almost 26 years now. I’m 22. 


     While I am absolutely psyched about having such a high credit score (and do pay all of my personal bills on time, etc) I can’t do anything with it. I have some kind of freeze or lock on my credit. I couldn’t even get a phone line with AT&amp;T with a $250 down payment on an $700 phone. My own credit union won’t approve me for even a $1000 loan. At all. Not even with a stupid high APR. Every time I try to do anything even remotely concerning my credit, I’m either instantly denied, or they ask me a series of insane questions (what street addresses I’ve ever been associated with, what cars have been in my name, what phone numbers I’ve had) and the answer for me to all of them, as an adult, is none of the above. They’re all either questions of places we lived when I was basically an infant, or questions about places my parents lived before I was even born. I’ve checked experian to see if there’s a lock on my credit through them, and saw nothing. I can’t even make an account with equifax or view anything through them because of the questions and asking me about auto loans in my name in 2014 and who I took the loan out from  (when I was 16, definitely didn’t have an auto loan) and how much my monthly payments were on that. They even asked me about a personal loan from a jeweler from 2015? Which I very much did not have? 


     I just don’t know where to begin on trying to fix this. I’ve finally gotten to the point where I am almost 100% independent from my father (which took years of effort on separating all my stuff from him and finally just moving out, grabbing as much stuff as I could fit in the car and just leaving and getting a new phone plan) or so I thought, and now it feels like he can still basically control my whole life because I can’t even access my accounts to see if he’s locked or frozen my credit. I don’t know who to call, or how to even verify my identity considering that’s the purpose of those questions. I didn’t do any of this and feel extremely violated and upset at the fact that I can’t even take out a student credit card with a $200 limit in my name because of the lock or freeze on my credit that I didn’t put on there. I also know of at least one savings account that he has with my name as the primary account holder that I have zero access too, and I am highly motivated to believe that there is another account in the form of a trust that my grandfather started for me that my father has lied to me about that is also in my name (according to a letter I received from the bank asking for consent to insure my trust and my mother asking me why I didn’t already know about it when I called and asked her because my father wouldn’t tell me anything about it). 


     I believe this is actually a case of parent child identity theft just in a really weird scenario of improving and building my credit score but still doing things to my accounts without my consent. Is there anything I can do or anyone I can call? Should I just call a lawyer at this point? I feel overwhelmed about the idea of not being able to access my own accounts and being able to see what’s in my own name due to him locking everything and refusing to tell me anything. Obviously credit reports and bank information is very secure, which means I can’t just pull it up even with my name and SS.

t3_gi0y9y,personalfinance,Car ownership for one year,"I would like to ""own"" a car, for, say one year. I live in Manhattan, NYC where parking + insurance are very expensive, I haven't ever had a car (hence the high insurance) but I've made the decision to get one for around a year for better commuting during coronavirus times, weekend getaways, taking some short road trips, etc.

If it were permanent, obviously I'd just buy one, but I expect my situation to change so I want to plan around one year.

I'm weighing up these options:

* Taking a one year lease transfer through leasetrader / swapalease. There are some appealing options at around $400/month, &gt; 1000 miles / month. Being under warranty with minimal servicing and a fixed end date is appealing, with this option all the costs are more or less fixed and predictable, but there are some transfer and lease end fees in addition to the monthly that all start to add up.
* Buying a used car in good condition and selling again after a year. This is appealing because it might be a little cheaper than leasing, and there's more flexibility around the end date and mileage, for what that's worth. On the other hand, I am concerned about being on the hook for any major mechanical repairs. I am also very concerned about the disposal part of transaction - where I am, my parking + insurance is around $600/month, so I wouldn't want to be paying that while I am looking for a buyer, or alternatively having to take a low-ball offer / trade-in from a dealer. If I had some dealer / mechanic / service I trusted to help with these aspects it could work, but I don't. I'm honestly not even sure what I should expect my ballpark loss should be to buy and then resell a $20k-ish car after a year through carvana or some local dealer.
* Rolling one-month rentals from Avis / Hertz / etc. I'm doing this now, and I've done it in the past for a 6 month stretch. It's actually pretty good, you get a decent rate for 1 month stints, totally all-in (servicing, tires, cleaning), and I have a corporate discount that gets it pretty low. The downside is that you don't get a particularly great car, the price might shoot up at some point, and visiting the rental office for the change-overs and changing the tag with the garages I park at is a bit tedious.

I'm basically leaning towards the 1-year lease transfer. I don't really expect it to be too much less than the rolling one-month leases, but I can choose a nicer car and not worry about swapping it during the year.

Any other options or thoughts on how to make any of these work better would be much appreciated !","Car ownership for one yearI would like to ""own"" a car, for, say one year.

t3_gi0utf,personalfinance,Getting home loan w/low down payment,"Hello all

I’m weighing my options and am looking into buying a home.  Based on my situation it’s probably not likely but I like to weigh my options and this particular situation is not a topic I have found much info for, which is why I’m asking for your advice even though it’s not probable. 

About me:
37 y/o, single no kids
NYC metro area
$100-120k annual income
825 credit score
Stable income even in this current and foreseeable COVID environment
Rent 1100, car 400 per month
Currently about 20k in savings but projected to have about 50k conservatively based on current trends 
401k w/ 100% match up to 6% plus 6k in Roth IRA, $3500 HSA per year

Looking at homes for 450-500k and would have about 50k down, to purchase early to mid 2021

So since I’m not going to have enough for 20% down, I know I’ll have to pay PMI in this situation.  With that considered, I am still somewhat interested because I want to settle down and own my home. And with the way home prices have been going up since my adulthood, I feel like next year or thereabouts will be a good opportunity. 

Would you recommend going ahead with my plan?  And why or why not?

Thank you so much and I look forward to reading your feedback","Getting home loan w/low down paymentHello all

t3_gi0t9s,personalfinance,How much can a lender increase closing cost?,"i got an email today that my loan estimate had changed and low and behold it has increased 5k. The difference is they took away a $5000 adjustment/credit that they had coming back to us the entire time.

t3_gi0lty,personalfinance,Renting out my garage to a neighbor for parking. Any suggestions?,"Hey r/PF folks, so a guy in my neighborhood needs a garage to park his very nice car in. He's going to pay me $100 a month for a spot in the one car garage attached to my house. Pretty sweet boost to our monthly income.

So I have seen quite a few templates for parking lease contracts online, and will probably pick whichever seems best. Definitely will make sure I am not liable for any damage to the car, should it occur. We both agree that 6 month duration will work. I am also going to ask the guy for a couple references as well as emergency contact.

I figure there's a lot that can go wrong with an arrangement like this, but I don't want to be paranoid either. He will only have garage access. Entrance to house is secure.

t3_ghwlq3,personalfinance,Car Payment Finance Advice,"Over the weekend, a close friend of mine decided to finance a 2020 Camaro SS. The concern I have about his purchase is that he gets paid under the table for an e-ciggs company whose products are not legal/approved etc. He gets paid in cash, with no trace of income nor money withdrawn for Taxes. I am very confused and concerned as he put this car under his name and has to pay it for the next 6 years (about $600 for monthly payment + $approx 300 for insurance). In order to purchase the car, he wrote down his previous gas station job, but was not asked for any check stubs or proof of income in order to be approved for the vehicle. However, my concern further grows as I fear that him paying the car with under the table money he deposits in the bank account will alert the IRS.

I tried searching google but couldn’t find an answer I was looking for, so I guess I will ask since that’s what this is for, right? I’m 17, graduating high school this year(birthday in summer) and then I am leaving in July on a two year mission for my church. I have about $7,000 saved up and my costs for this mission will be from 200-250 a month depending on what my parents decide. This works out to $5000-$6250 for the entire mission. I had an idea. Instead of leaving my money in a saving account making maybe 2% interest, I could give one of my trusted friends a car loan that would be two years long, say at 9% interest, and have a secure return while helping a friend who may not have credit buy a car. If this loan was a two year period I would be left with a few hundred dollars more than if I just let it sit there. What are your thoughts?","Loaning money for car?Hi Reddit.

t3_ghy8mc,personalfinance,Is it irresponsible for me to quit my job due to the high stress of working full-time while being a decent parent and teacher?,"**Summary:** Hoping for objective feedback on whether it is fiscally responsible for me to consider temporarily leaving the workforce to be a more present parent/teacher and improve my own mental health. Total income reduction would be \~40%.

I want to acknowledge from the start that I know we're very privileged to be able to consider this option. Also, our school district is known for being woefully underfunded and ill-prepared for anything outside of the ordinary, so unfortunately we just can't count on a plan that will actually be supportive of working parents. The resources we've been provided to date suggest a six-hour cobbled-together ""curriculum"" of websites, and as full-time working parents that's just not reasonable. Again, recognizing our privilege here and acknowledging that a lot of parents are dealing with the same thing and have no choice but to continue to muddle through.

**All the context:** I have been in my field for over a decade in a few different companies (never less than three years at any) and at increasing levels. I've built solid connections, and the field I'm in now is not in danger of decline. However, my current employer is in an at-risk industry, though in a growth niche of that industry and doing quite well before COVID-19. I work for HQ and have solid job security relative to other positions, but a month ago the company did lay off 25% of total HQ staff (including open positions) and us survivors took a 10% pay cut. The company is doing everything possible to stay relevant and grow revenue within current constraints, but due to the industry there is a lot out of anyone's control (so there's a fair chance more cuts are on the horizon, and work will continue to consolidate to those who remain).

I don't love what I do, but I'm good at it, am respected, and have curated valuable connections at different companies. However, with all the ambiguity of COVID-19 my job has become more stressful than ever. As the SME people depend on me for a lot, and the amount of requests and projects I'm being pulled into is excessive, but necessary. Meanwhile, I also have a young child in elementary school, and neither my spouse nor I have been able to devote enough time to effectively continuing his education beyond relying on Khan Academy and the like and doing a hands-on science experiments maybe once a week.

Given the high stress of my job, the marketability of my field, and the fact that school and childcare very likely won't be any kind of ""normal"" at least through the end of 2020, I'm seriously considering leaving my job and looking for something new next year. I could likely take an unpaid FMLA leave, but realistically I know that's not enough time, and I know I wouldn't want to return after taking time off.Pros to quitting: Dedicated time to spend with the kid, less stress for my spouse so he can more fully focus on work, head space for me to give some actual thought to whether I even want to continue in my field or pivot to something else, and greatly decreased stress.Cons: \~40% decrease in household income, potential difficulty re-entering job market, additional stress on my spouse being the ""breadwinner"".

This plan is tight, but we have savings if an unexpected expense comes up. It does not account for contributions to my retirement, though we could fund an IRA for 2020.

This plan is tight, but we have savings if an unexpected expense comes up. It does not account for contributions to my retirement, though we could fund an IRA for 2020. It also does not account for contributions to other savings vehicles, like the 529 education savings account for our son (his account currently has \~$10k in it). If necessary we could cut further in food and entertainment. Not planning any travel obviously.I'd plan to return to work early/mid-2021.

t3_ghzwjb,personalfinance,"About to start medical school, how do I manage my money?","Hello r/personalfinance, I am in my mid 20's and will soon be starting medical school this July. I chose the cheapest school I was accepted to which will cost about $50k in tuition/year. I should add that I have also found reasonable housing with a roommate for $500/month. I am very fortunate since my grandparents left me one of their investment properties which generates $700/month of profit but could be sold for $450k. (the amount left on the 30 yr mortgage is approximately 250k) 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, should I keep the property, live off the $700/month and take a federal direct unsubsidized loan at 6.08% with 1.059% fees to pay for tuition (50k/year)

or

should I sell the property, and use the money to fund medical school and living expenses for those 4 years. This would cause me to have no loans, but I lose out on $700/month for possibly a long time and the property possibly appreciating in value over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this information helps but the specialties I am interested in range anywhere from 300k to 400k salary per year and require 3-4 years of residency following medical school where I would be making \~50k.

t3_ghzv2p,personalfinance,Credit Union charged off account with $0 balance,"Recently I decided to be more adult and be more aggressive about improving my credit. I got an account at myfico.com and was really surprised to see my credit score dropped nearly 100 points in the past year. Although I haven't been good at monitoring my credit, I'm very good at paying my bills on time, saving, and investing. So it was a shock to see my credit score that once was around 775 is sitting at 689.  After looking into my official credit report (Experian) I have a bank account that is ""Charged Off""!  Impossible I think to myself. I dig into it and what happen was I forgot an old bank account that I had been meaning to close was attached to my PayPal and I didn't realize it, this was about a year ago. At the time I realized I logged in to find a ton of NSF fees and I'm about $70 overwithdrawn. I transfer what money I had in the savings account ($5) to show I'm making progress in paying it and immediately set up a transfer from my primary bank account to cover the balance. About a week later it goes through and I pay off the overwithdrawn account and remove all connections to this account to avoid this in the future.  So fast forward to yesterday when I see this account is ""charged off"". I look into it and at the time of charge off it had a $0 balance. How do you charge off nothing?  


After looking into it, it looks like creditors have to wait 120 days to charge off an account and mine was only negative for 49 days. Does the 120 day wait not apply to banking accounts?  What is my recourse?  I know it was dumb to forget about a bank account, but it's equally dumb to have a HUGE ding to my credit for 7 years over a debt I paid during my legally allowed time frame.

t3_9w474g,StudentLoans,How to Identify a Student Loan Scam,"It seems it's time to sticky another post about this based on recent sub activity.

**Here's the most important bit - you should never have to pay for help with your student loans.  There isn't a person or entity on the planet that can get you a better deal, or access to a benefit or program, that you can't get yourself, for free, by working directly through your loan holder.**

The second most important bit is the old school - if it sounds too good to be true, it almost assuredly is.

While it's not illegal to charge for student loan help, many of the companies that do also engage in what is absolutely fraudulent and deceptive behaviour.  If you experience any of the following, we here at /r/studentloans encourage you to report it to your local attorney general's office and the Federal Trade Commission as well as the Department of Education.  All of these entities are actively pursuing and taking enforcement actions against these companies.

Warning signs/things to report:

Company claims to ""work with"" or partner with the Department of Education on any of the student loan servicers

Claims you can receive forgiveness, especially before knowing anything about your student loan balance and loan type

Mentions ""the Obama forgiveness program"" - there's no such thing

Creates a sense of urgency for you to sign up right away

Asks for a power of attorney over your loan accounts

Asks for any of your FSA or other passwords or PINS (never give those - to anyone)

Many of these companies ask for a large up front enrollment fee - anywhere from six hundred to twelve hundred dollars and then a monthly fee of around 39 bucks.  They often infer that the monthly fee is actually your student loan payment.  For these fees they will consolidate your loans - which you can do easily - for free - at www.studentloans.gov and often put the loans in forbearance - so no payment is due but interest is still accruing - and take you thirty nine dollars every month to ""monitor"" the account - i.e. do nothing.

I have personally worked with a borrower who had been in repayment for fifteen years when she was snagged by one of these companies.  They had her sign a POA and used it to change all the contact info on the account to their own address and phone number.  She paid a few thousand up front and the typical thirty nine bucks monthly - she thought that was her payment.  After three years she gets a call from the feds - her loan was in default and double what it was when she started.  They'd put it in forbearance until they couldn't anymore - then just let it go delinquent and default and disappeared with her money.  The feds only found her through skip tracing.  And there was nothing anyone could do for her

t3_ghp77u,StudentLoans,Update on credit bureau reporting for COVID waivers - also some new info on IDR recertification,"Hi there.  This weekend many of you reported that your credit bureau reports showed your status as deferred or in forbearance for loans that are eligible for the covid waivers.  Some of you also showed a credit score drop because of it.  As you may know, the CARES Act requires that these waivers be reported as if you were on time and making payments.

I've spoken to several folks in the industry and am told that the issue is one of system programming.  Up until now, there were no forbearances or deferments that should be reported as anything other than a forbearance or deferment.  The servicing systems had to be reprogrammed to report these waivers as in repayment and receiving payments even though they are actually in a forbearance.  That took time.  The servicers must report to the credit bureaus on the 10th of each month.  While they were able to get the waivers placed on the accounts by then, some were not able to complete the additional programming needed to correctly report the status by the April 10th reporting date.  Hence the deferred status on the credit reports.

I am told that for most if not all - i believe all - of the servicers, this programming was completed in time for the May 10th (really today since the 10th was a sunday) reporting so all the accounts should be updated in the next few weeks.  I suggest checking your credit reports in a week and if not updated in another two weeks.  If not updated in a month let me know.

As far as IDR certification goes - they have been pushed out by six months.  You can still recertify on your anniversary date even if it falls during the waivers - but if you don't want to you can wait.  Just keep an eye on any correspondence you receive to make sure you aren't waiting too long and end up with capitalized interest.

EDIT:  If there's anyone living in Georgia that is willing to be on camera (from your home via zoom) with an Atlanta news station - and that was negatively affected by this credit bureau issue - please let me know and I'll connect you with the station.","Update on credit bureau reporting for COVID waivers - also some new info on IDR recertificationHi there.

 Not sure if this is the right place to post but I see a lot of people posting about their debt journey and how they paid it off.

I feel like this content would help inspire others who aren't doctors/lawyers/engineers.

If this is of interest to others, I will post my blog (not started yet), but I feel like I can't be the only normal person that is able to pay off debt and still somehow get by.

t3_ghz2d7,StudentLoans,"Conflicting advice for mountain of debt (high salary, frugal lifestyle)","Hello all! I'm extremely happy with my career, but it's landed me with quite a bit of student debt.  

The only debt I have is my student loans (All direct federal loans) and ooh boy get prepared for some sticker shock:  
Total debt: $595,569.81  
I am currently enrolled in REPAYE and making no payments because I had $0 income on my 2018 tax return. Please understand my reasoning for choosing this method of payment.  
Here are my payoff choices as I see it:  
1. income based repayment at about $1500 per month with 25 year loan forgiveness/corresponding tax bill of $300,000 ish = $750,000 paid over 25 years  
2. refinance loans and pay off in 10 years- assuming 4% refinancing, the bill would be about $6,060 per month, which is my entire take-home pay, so this is not currently a feasible option = $727,200 total paid over 10 years  
3. change career tracks entirely, go into Public Service Loan Forgiveness job for 10 years, pay income based repayment about $1,500 per month, balance is forgiven after 10 years tax-free on qualifying loans = $180,000 paid over 10 years. 

PSLF seems like an obvious choice, but I'm not so sure. The current president has talked about ending the PSLF program, which really makes me nervous. Also, while public service is certainly worthwhile, it's not how I want to go for professional reasons. Additionally these jobs are highly competitive and even if I find one, it might require me to uproot and move somewhere else entirely. I'm also really happy in my current job/area, and I have lots of room to improve myself and my situation. My salary has the potential to double or even triple with bonuses. So, my current choice is to go with option 1) 25 year loan forgiveness with ridiculous tax bill. 

Recently a mentor recommended refinancing to a 30-year term in order to free up cash flow, and pay off aggressively with any extra money. **Wouldn't this cost me more in the long run**? 

It's important to me to reach financial independence. I max out my 401k (15% of gross income) and put more than 50% of my take home pay into savings. Recently I just started to invest in index funds as a tactic to save up for the tax bill on my loan forgiveness.

t3_gi361j,StudentLoans,"Refinancing, surviving, etc.","Hi everyone!

I just graduated LITERALLY yesterday, and I’m already trying to get ahead in terms of managing my debt. I have $154k in debt from my undergrad (yikes, I know). About $120k is private from Discover with interest ranging from 6-8%, and the remainder is federal. 

I’ll be working as a nurse, so I know my income will be okay. My only other expenses as of right now is my car payment and insurance which is about $350/month, as I’m lucky enough to still live with my parents. Obviously, my loans aren’t going to be due until December, but I want to be ahead of the game instead of getting surprised with an outrageous monthly payment. I have okay credit. Credit karma said I have a 753, but when I had my credit pulled for an auto loan, it showed up as a 683.

Would I be able to refinance before they’re due in December? Or, would I be better refinancing around then? Basically, asking when the best time to refinance is. 

Also, has anyone refinanced similar amounts? What companies did you use &amp; how was your experience?
I’d also appreciate any possible tips on managing this insane amount of debt.

t3_gi8qkd,StudentLoans,PSLF and Forbearance Question - Trying to Understand my Options,"I recently started a job with the federal government which I'm hoping will make me eligible for PSLF and my loans can be forgiven after 10 years. 


I was originally planning on opting out of the forbearance for the Cares Act as I'm still working but I've been reading into it more and people have said not to make extra payments if you are planning on having the loans forgiven. Instead put that money into an emergency fund or the like. 


Regardless of whether I'm able to enter into the PSLF my loans are on the REPAYE plan so they would be (hopefully) forgiven in 20-25 years. I'm only 4 years into my payments.


I'm looking for advice- should I opt out of the forbearance? Should I just make extra payments towards the high interest loans?

t3_ghzoll,StudentLoans,First time Student loan questions/options?,"Hey everyone, I apologize in advance as I have a particular case and would like some feedback, opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be going back to school in the fall. Going in as a freshman at 24 (Got my first degree from a community college in Unmanned Aircraft with no loans). I moved to another state for work, so, unfortunately, I won't qualify for instate until the summer of 2021(I have every intention of staying in this state to live and work, and can prove so). I have filled out the FAFSA and maxed out my federal grants and student loans. I have emergency savings, however long story short what I had in my regular savings was used for medical bills due to a not-at-fault car accident last year. I should be able to get that money back whenever the suit completes, which could be another 12 months at this point as its being dragged out. 

I am unable to both pay for school and my living expenses working part-time while in Out of State classification due to cost.  I have already set up everything to get into the engineering program, and my spot would not necessarily be held if I took a gap year, so that is something id like to avoid. My credit is not the best right now, and currently only got approved with Sallie Mae at 9% for 20,000. The rest of the semesters, ill be able to pay out of pocket. 

My question is, do you think that taking the loan out for 9% to get me through this school year is worth it? Any other ideas on other places I should try applying?  Also, would it be easy to refinance in 1-2 years when my credit is better? (I've been slowly increasing it over the last 6 months and it is a priority in my life)

t3_ghtu65,StudentLoans,Student loan refinancing - when is the best time for me?,"i am a current medicine resident about to graduate in 2 months. The numbers I'm looking at are:

1. Starting salary will go from $60k --&gt; $350k.

3. My budget will allow me to pay about $10k/month toward my loans (I will make a lump sum payment at the end of the current interest free period). Because of this, if I stay on PAYE there shouldn't be any interest capitalization that occurs for my next recertification when I no longer meet the ""financial hardship"" definition.

4. If I were to refinance, as a conservative estimate I could probably get the interest down to 4%, but if I do this before paying off the outstanding interest then it will capitalize and become part of my principle.

I've been trying to wrap my head around the math and I'm just having a hard time figuring it out. My question is when should I plan to refinance my loans down to a lower rate?

Alright, so let me get a few things straight:

* I **did not** choose to defer my payments -- My autopay was automatically suspended until November 2020, due to the CARES Act, an action explicitly taken by the servicer on ""my behalf""
* Per the CARES Act, any loan that is current (mine was) at time of ""relief"" (again, relief that I did not seek) is required to be reported as current through the end of relief, per [this explanation by Experian](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-the-cares-act-affects-credit-reports-and-scores/)
* This is now theoretically a statement that will ding me on a monthly basis through November, causing my score to drop significantly, as well as remain on my report for the **next 7 years**

How can I be negatively impacted by an action that **I didn't even opt to take**? An action that was **automatically taken by the loan servicer?**

I have been working extensively to up my credit since mid-last year and am nothing short of infuriated right now.

What would be the best course of action here? Contact the credit bureaus and dispute? I can't be the only one that's going to be hurt by this -- These are federal loans, which suggests many, many of us are about to experience similar impact, which will be very damaging in the long term.","Student Loans Are Being Reported To Credit Bureaus!

Most of my classmates are going to do REPAYE instead of standard payment during residency, because they won't be able to afford the standard monthly payment on our low salary.

* $ 9,500 of a Grad PLUS loan

I’ve calculated 60k because that will give me a little wiggle room for unexpected expenses. I also want to avoid any incident where I’m missing the minimum payment. 

Is it up to me about how much I can pay off each month in addition to the minimum? If I have money left over from the loan itself to pay back the loan interest, does that mean I’m taking out too much?

t3_ghar87,StudentLoans,Student Loan amounts fluctuating in my credit profiles,"So I owe an obscene amount of money for an associate's degree I earned thru UOP years ago. *cringe*  Times had been really tough for a while with losing our jobs, home and cars in 2008, and during the rebuilding process through the years, my loans have been in and out of deferment. I tried to pay on them, even in deferred status, but every year, the amount jumps up by leaps and bounds.

I'm currently waiting on a decision for my Borrowers Defense app, but it's been a couple years, and my expectations are not high.

My question,  however, is why is it when I check Credit Karma every week do the amounts owed go up or down by hundreds and thousands?

Last week my credit score dropped a few points and the only changes were that each loan went up by $20 or $30; however, this morning my credit score went up by 67 points, the only change being that my loans reported decreased of $716  and $400 respectively.

t3_ggpraf,StudentLoans,My fiance's afraid to apply for FAFSA due to her previous college years GPA,"My fiance had attended KU for four years a few years ago. In her last year there she battled with depression and loneliness; this made her grades and overall GPA suffer. She ended up leaving KU without graduating.

Now that she's ready to go back to school and finish her degree she's afraid to apply for Financial Aid because of something someone she works with told her.

This co-worker of hers told her that if she were to apply for FAFSA to attend this new school that they would have to pull her old GPA/transcript from KU and that would affect her GPA at this new school; possibly even making them not accept her. 

I have never heard anything like this, and I wonder if it's even true. But because she believes it to be true she's trying to get me to apply for loans for her to be able to pay for college. I don't mind this as I want her to succeed and would do anything for her, but I need to know if this is a real thing or if she's been told a lie.

Can anyone answer this? And thank you in advance for the help. This whole thing has been a central force for some recent arguments and stress.

t3_gh2zh3,StudentLoans,Advice for what to repay off,"Hi everyone, 18M college student here

I currently have about 10k loans in my name (the rest are in my parents' name) and this number will go up an extra ~7k, since I have another year of school left. I was able to pay off about ~4k last summer but I still have ways to go.

Since I couldn't be in the dorms for the rest of the semester this year due to COVID-19,  I was refunded about ~3k.

My question is, since there are no interest rates currently, should I use the 3k to pay off more of my principal 10k debt?

The other thing I was thinking of doing is, in the fall, I'll probably have an apartment that costs ~700 a month and so I was thinking of saving up for that.

t3_ggonln,StudentLoans,Took out a loan from Sallie Mae that I can't pay back and I'm contemplating suicide as the only way out,"This post isn't a rant, or a diss on Sallie Mae. I'm also not trying to get sympathy from anyone on this sub. I'll try to be as brief as possible.

I was an international student in the U.S., I took out a loan to pay for my studies, with the help from a co-signer. Finished college, got my degree, got a few jobs that didn't pay much, then had to come back to my home country because my student visa had expired.

The amount due I have to pay to Sallie May for the loan repayment is set between $400 - $500 (the total balance is around $30K). My family has been helping me make the payments, however, it can't go on for much longer. Our financial situation is deteriorating, and coming up with that amount on a monthly basis is near impossible.

I've spoken to Sallie Mae on several occasions about this. They've told me these are my options:

Forbearance - Of which I only get 12 months, and I've used 9 of those already.

Refinance - A procedure for which I'll need my co-signer to cooperate and give over financial information to Sallie Mae, something they're not willing to do.

That's pretty much it. Other than that, if the amount isn't paid in full each month, it will affect the credit of my co-signer radically, and there might be debt collectors involved, and I can't let that happen (my co-signer is a relative living in the U.S.).

There are documents from Sallie Mae that state that if the loan borrower passes away, under any circumstance, the loan is forgiven and the debt is cancelled.

This is basically the only option I have available where neither my co-signer or my family is affected financially. I've spoken directly to Sallie Mae about this and they've confirmed that, once the death certificate is produced, the loan is forgiven.

It's a tricky situation but given the circumstances I sincerely don't see any other way out. I've been living under stress, struggling to come up with this amount on a monthly basis, for the better part of the past couple of years. I'm just exhausted.

I'm not sure what I expect by posting this here. Certainly not a solution, nor validation. I guess I just needed to take this off my chest.","Took out a loan from Sallie Mae that I can't pay back and I'm contemplating suicide as the only way outThis post isn't a rant, or a diss on Sallie Mae.

t3_ggq7ss,StudentLoans,Should I take out a loan for law school if it’s not **entirely** necessary?,"I already have $35,000 in loans from undergrad (which I think won’t accrue interest while I’m in school)... 

My law school scholarship covers most of the tuition... but it leaves around $2500 per semester that I have to come up with myself

Along with that $2500 I’m going to need to pay for first semester books.... I just feel like perhaps taking out a loan for this amount isn’t a good idea. I’ll probably need $5k-$7k in total to avoid taking out a loan (my living expenses are already saved)

My mother says I should take out a full $20,500, but she has almost $300,000 in debt from loans. 

She’s a veteran and also says she’s never paying them and has managed to find all sorts of loopholes and hasn’t paid on her loans for around a decade 

I don’t think I’ll be so lucky and I can’t entirely rely on her judgment here. My total loan amount would be around $55,000 if I take the loan... but what if I don’t get into a high paying position? That’s around $595 a month that I still have to pay (if I pay them off in 10 years; depending on interest rates). 

I would only take the one loan for the entirety of law school, I wouldn’t need it for the next two years.

t3_ggy1k9,StudentLoans,Subsidized/unsubsidized payment allocation,"So I have some federal loans through Nelnet. 8 groups, interest ranges between 3.7-4.6%, and amounts owed on different groups ranges between $2200-$5200. About $25k total. 

I don’t have a lot of money to be making extra payments right now, but.. I keep hearing that w/interest frozen right now it’s good to make any extra payments you can. The subsidized loans only have like $3 in interest on them currently, unsubsidized show to have capitalized interest ranging from $150-$350 on 4 of the groups. I’ve just been paying by account for 1.5 years because I didn’t quite understand (prob still don’t). 

So, if I made a payment right now, 1. would I pay by group and ONLY target the unsubsidized groups since these are generally worse? Or pay the ones with the highest interest rate? Although the interest rates really aren’t much different (3.7-4.6%) so idk if it would matter. **I guess I’m wondering if I can pay off any old interest that was capitalizing before interest starts accruing again.. so it’s not interest on interest.. if that even makes sense.. I’m a first gen college student so trying to figure all of this out. If it matters, I’m starting grad school in August and will be in deferment again, so the interest on the unsubsidized loans will just start capitalizing while I’m in school again (I think).. so in my mind what’s the point of paying it now just for it to go back up? 

2. Would the payment go towards the capitalized interest I still owe or towards the principal? I keep hearing it goes to principal, but idk if that’s the case since I still owe interest that accrued from before March. 

Any advice would be appreciate. I have seriously got to figure these loans out. Not much I can do to pay them down before I start grad school, but I’ll need to know this for after I graduate.","Subsidized/unsubsidized payment allocationSo I have some federal loans through Nelnet. 8 groups, interest ranges between 3.7-4.6%, and amounts owed on different groups ranges between $2200-$5200.

t3_gg7zlp,StudentLoans,"$50,000 paid since I graduated one year ago.","Exactly one year ago I graduated with a masters degree and $60,000 in student loans. I had began my graduate program (costing $45,000 in loans) right after my undergraduate program (costing $15,000 in loans). 

Thankfully, both degrees were in pretty strong fields (both were in compsci + finance) and I was able to start working for $95,000. Since then, I switched jobs and am now making 110,000. 

I have spent the last twelve months living like a hermit, so this whole covid lockdown thing is basically what I would be doing anyways lol. I spend quite little on entertainment, I can’t remember the last time I was actually in a restaurant...

I spend about $2,300 to $2,700 in living expenses (most of which is rent really). 

I’ve been able to make consistent payments of $3,000 each month. With my recent tax returns, reimbursed PTO, and stimulus check I was able to recently make a $12,000 lump sum payment in addition to those regular payments.

So here I am one year after graduation with just $10,000 left. I feel pretty sure I can finish that in three months. 

There is so much I want to do after:
1. I’ve never been on a vacation before. Like, ever. I really want to see what all the fuss is about. I’ve heard good things about Cancun?
2. I really love interior design. I am excited to actually build my home with quality furnishings. My boss makes fun of my current apartment furnished with patio chairs. 
3. I’ve always been pretty skinny (150lb @ 6’0”). Once I finish SL, I’d like to bulk up on protein rich meals and focus my sheer force of will upon regularly hitting the gym. 
4. I’ve stopped dating for the last year to focus on my finances. I knew it’d be a grind and I didn’t want to share the emotional burden. Excited to rekindle that fire. 
5. I have a bunch of younger siblings about to start college soon. I’d like to contribute some of my income to help them avoid the stress that has loomed over me since I first started college.
6. I really want to be an early home owner. I’m only 23 years old right now, but I’d love to own a home outright before I’m 35.
7. Did I mention I haven’t eaten out recently? Ah I miss a quality served meal. I’d love to just eat out every day for one whole month regardless of cost. 

I am positively stoked to finish this up. Eliminating this debt has been the only thing on my mind since 2014... I can’t believe I am finally approaching the end of the era.

Edit** some dude below is raining on my parade here by claiming I’m maliciously editing my posts/comments. I don’t know his deal either. I’ve only edited stuff to fix up my dyslexia-induced typos.

This is my first time taking out a loan, so my brain is frazzled from trying to process all of the information I've been reading.

t3_gg7tr5,StudentLoans,Student loan or new credit card,"I’m not sure if this is the best subreddit for this but I think it’s close enough.

I am planning/hoping to take summer classes at my local university as a non-degree seeking visitor. It is part of a DIY post bacc for premed. The total cost for summer is ~6k . I have money saved up and was hoping to only take a loan of roughly 3.5-4K. However I need a co-signer, and at the moment my mother can’t co-sign as her and her business partner applied for a small business loan and are waiting to get approved. So she doesn’t want her co-sign to cause her business not to get the loan. 

So my thoughts were that I can wait another week or so to see if she hears back, but I’m on a time crunch as the deadline for registration is June 19th. Or I was thinking of opening up a new credit card and splitting the 6k between this credit card and an old one I’ve had. I’d look for a new credit card with great benefits ofc. 

I really don’t want to open a new credit card as the internet rates are much higher then a student loan.

t3_gfw5ey,StudentLoans,In a bit of a unique situation and need some advise!,"So as the title states, I'm in a bit of a unique situation and need some help prioritizing my finances.  I will try to be as clear as possible. 

Currently, I hold about $25k in federal student loans.  Zero debt anywhere else, only in in my loans. Make about 2.5K a month, maybe more if i decide to work OT.  I will be attending graduate school come January, so i will be taking out more loans, obviously.  My plan pre-covid was to pay the minimums and save money for school, take on the new debt, then consolidate/refi once I graduated and locked down a job. 

Now with the 0% interest I've been paying down a little more in hopes to get a little further.  BUT I've since applied and am now in a good spot to be awarded a US Navy scholarship that will pay me throughout grad school (they wont be paying tuition or the school, just a salary to me every month) starting January 2021 . I will own them 3+ years afterwards which I am very much looking forward to. 

Guess my question is do I continue aggressively paying down loans now and throughout school if I can afford it (while still taking on new grad loans), or simply continue to pay the minimum and continue on with the original plan?  Assuming I am awarded the scholarship, does being an active military member have any benefits on interest rates?  I will technically be active military while in school, but I know my loans will be in deferment at that point.    Assuming I do not get the scholarship, is my original plan a good one?   

Poke holes in the plan! Thanks everyone in advance.","In a bit of a unique situation and need some advise!So as the title states, I'm in a bit of a unique situation and need some help prioritizing my finances.  I will try to be as clear as possible.

Should we refinance to 1 loan maybe get 3.5% and make payments. 

Stay as is and hope for student debt forgiveness. She is a social worker so hopefully would qualify for forgiveness. 

Or pay it off in a large chunk and be debt and monthly payment free?

t3_gfla3h,StudentLoans,What's the best way to make payments while there's no interest?,"I have four loans that are currently not accruing any interest through to October due to the CARE act. I'm trying to figure out what the best way to take advantage of this is. When I first graduated, I didn't know much and made the mistake of paying off four small loans with low interest and leaving the larger ones that accrue more. I definitely don't want to make that mistake again as it has cost a lot of money! 

&amp;nbsp;

The loans are: 

* E: 2,920 @ 3.4%

* F: 8,630 @ 6.8%

* G: 12,800 @ 6.21%

* H: 12,300 @ 5.84%

&amp;nbsp;

Normally, for every 100$ that I pay in, I pay $40 to G, $25 to H, $20 to F, and $10 to E. Since the CARE act started I've been putting all my payments towards loan G, as it accrues the most interest. Should I keep making all payments towards G, or should I split it up between the others more? I was thinking maybe 50% of all payments to G with 25% each to F and H. Before CARE, I'd paid ahead enough to not have any payments due until April 2021, but of course they'd still accrue interest. I'd like to keep as far ahead as I can as I'm unable to work much (yay health issues!) and so money is tight.","What's the best way to make payments while there's no interest?I have four loans that are currently not accruing any interest through to October due to the CARE act.

t3_gfn4gj,StudentLoans,Private loans without a co-signer?,"Hello, 

I am starting an accelerated nursing program which I will be graduating in October 2021. Currently, the school I am attending has awarded me 12,500 in govt loans to help pay for the cost. However, this unfortunately does not cover the entire cost of the program and thus I need to resort to private loans. I have never taken a private loan out and was naive to think that I could just be given one as I have good credit and recently finished paying off my car. So far, every website I have looked at requires co-signers if I want to take out a loan to pay for my school. The few that I found required ridiculous payments of $150 and up a month, which I can't afford as I am already squeezing by till I graduate with what I have saved up for rent and other expenses. As of now, my father has passed away a few years ago, and my mother almost passed away last year and consequently has racked up a ton of medical debt. I am unsure of what to do at this point as I don't really have any family to turn to for help and I have been pretty self sufficient since I graduated high school. If anyone could give me some tips or help on getting a deferred loan without a co-signer, or perhaps some other way of paying for my school that would be great. Right now for this semester I still need to pay off $6,372 by the end of June.","Private loans without a co-signer?Hello,

During UG, me/my parents co-signed on some loans for me to finish UG. Unfortunately, I was unable to stay current on the loans. They are charged off. these are about 10 years old. Current credit score 680.

About 5 years ago, I tried to do a PhD, but dropped out due to not wanting to go to academia. According to my loan statement, I had a Grad Plus Loan for it, it was like 5 or 10k.

t3_gfel2q,StudentLoans,Looking for some encouragement,"Happy Thursday everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are currently in our fourth month of student loan debt snowball.  Other than our house and her car, it is the only debt we have.

When we first started in January, we had a combined total of $68,000 to pay off.  She had 3 loans \~$4000, $10000, and $25000 of which we have officially paid off the $4000 one in April.  I have one loan for $29000.

Our next loan to tackle is the $10k one, which I would like to have paid off by the end of the year.  We have been adding $1000-1200 towards the principle plus the monthly to drive down the balance for the target loan.

Is this the right thing to do in terms of paying them off early?  Is there anything else I can do?  I feel like this is going to take forever and feel impatient. We've definitely decreased our spending but aren't eating ramen every night.

Just really looking for some encouragement to keep going or Im open to any suggestions to optimize my game plan by changing things up.

Thank you all for your time and recommendations.

Can someone help me understand this as this is all new to me. Sorry if it’s a dumb question.I originally started my loan at $43,313. After graduating and accrued interest, I ended up at $47,203.26. 

My first payment was due in January of $514.70 out of that payment $141.38 went to my principal and the remaining $373.28 was applied to interest. 

My second payment in February was $514.70. $301.02 went to my principal and $213.68 went to interest. 

My third payment in March after COVID hit I paid $514.70 again. Except $316.07 applied to my principal and $198.63 went to interest. 

Why is it that my first payment went all to interest and almost nothing to the principal? Also, If I pay off the interest I accrued and ask Nelnet to apply the $3,900 to the areas that interest accrued will it make any difference?

t3_ger52b,StudentLoans,Nelnet doing some sketchy stuff with COVID Forbearances,"So back in April, after the government came out with a new recommendation for loan providers and servicers to choose to honor FEEL loans (from a long time ago) with the same 0 interest and forbearance as federal loans.

So I thought yay, they actually chose to do the right thing.  Only thing is, then I got letters saying I lost my interest deduction incentive for 'non payment, late payment or change from electronic correspondence'.  I have paid double the amount due now for 5 yrs and never been late on a payment.  Even though forbearance was applied, I was still paying small amounts to cover interest.  I just called them only to find out they applied COVID forbearance due to my request ( I never requested it) and forbearance was considered the same as missing a payment, so they removed my interest incentives.

t3_gf9etp,StudentLoans,International Man of Being Broke,"Hi r/StudentLoans. I'm sure my abrupt and slightly odd first post makes it clear that I'm new here. But, it is all for the sake of getting as much advice as I can, for as long as I can.

THE PROBLEM:

As a last-minute miracle, deciding in February that I wanted to graduate this year a Junior, my dream University in Paris, France, ESCP, has accepted me into their program. Business in Management, 3-year program over three countries. France, Italy, Germany. It sounds all good and great, I was very happy to receive the news! But alas, comes the dark turn in the story.

See, much to my dismay, ESCP is only an accredited school to institutions in Europe (I.e. EQUIS) and not with the Board of Education here in the US. As a lower-middle-class American, this makes it very difficult as I cannot receive FAFSA support (I'm in the process of filling out my FAFSA anyways, in the event something changes) in any form.

To make matters worse, all the scholarships I've been applying to since last year? They all require the input of the school I'm attending from a [list of accredited schools](https://www.mba.today/schools/france). This isn't the professional source, but it contains the same names of schools in France that all the major websites and banks offer loans for. Not having my school on the list instantly means ineligibility, according to many of the sites. I assume they do this because they are scholarships that they send to the schools, as opposed to grants. Hell, even the pride-and-true ""private loan"" services I run into have the exact same procedure. Makes me wonder why anyone could see much of a difference.

Yearly tuition, for non-French nationals:€22,500

The aid this university IS offering, however, is the ever-so-common exoneration scholarships ""based on financial need"". I send them the financial information of my household, and I can get up to 50% exonerated from my tuition, which I re-apply to each year. The first year, they told me I am eligible for 70%, due to the pandemic (which helps). The following years are all dependent, regardless on the fact that I will be living alone and receiving $0 from family in assistance, on my family's income as well as mine.

ESCP does not offer housing. They do not offer grants. They have partnered with a French bank to give &lt;1% interest on loans, but it is exclusively for French Nationals (loans in general, not just the special deal). I simply need to live in a one-bedroom studio, they go on average  € 600 a month.

TL;DR I am going to business school for $12000 per year but I can't find any loan or funding options because Europe =/= America.

SOLUTIONS:

\#1So far, as I have been working nonstop since January before the pandemic (at a quite nice paying restaurant job), I will have saved up a total of $5000 by the end of May. In order to accept my enrollment into the school, I have to pay  €2500 euros of my year one's tuition by June 29 (I negotiated from the original date, which would have been MAY 11, two weeks after being accepted). Assuming that the minimum salary working minimum wage in Paris is  €1500 (roughly), I can certainly survive working full-time and doing school full-time with enough space between year one and two. That is the option better in the long-run, where I will not have to carry any debt for the first year at least. However, money will be tight, and I will be saving every dime for when I switch countries the next year and have to start all over with a new job and housing arrangement.

\#2I live in a very wealthy town (Naples, FL), and have worked among wealthy people in all the work experience I have gained over the years, even with some of the wealthiest people in the world. I don't intend to come across as condescending, it is just a plain observation I have made. My wealth nor status does not compare to the size of some of these people's careers. I've managed to get names and vague mentions that I may be able to meet with some connections, but otherwise I've been sticking to the internet to expand my network in terms of my education and funding (thanks corona). I may get lucky and someone may throw me a bone and offer me a grant for schooling. Or, one of you may know somebody with such ambitions/foundations/etc.

\#3Perhaps there are businesses out there who offer decent loans for students in my predicament, and hate to make themselves known on the inter webs. If this is the case, I would greatly appreciate some direction towards those organizations. I would at least want to take out a loan for year one, and work to pay off the rest of my education.

\#4

A strange man in a trench coat PMs me that so long as I meet him and his van downtown at 11 at night that he'll pay for my college and potentially throw some candy into the deal. I don't know if I will be able to resist this offer.

TL;DR#2 I can:

* Join the Rat-Race, work full-time
* Ask the CEOs for money
* Find Phantom Loan Company
* ???????

EDIT: Clarity. I'm looking for funding options, and ideas. Yes, I have the alternative of taking the typical path among my peers of going to UF/UCF/USF with my undergraduate paid for by the state, but the remainder is basically the same as ESCP, but now with the ability to take loans.","International Man of Being BrokeHi r/StudentLoans.

t3_ge3qxz,StudentLoans,I officially have enough money in my account to pay off my student loans and I don't know who else to tell!,"Starting in 2017 I took out $16k in federal student loans to pay for grad school. I graduated in December 2018 but didn't start making payments on the loans until May 2019 when I started being self-employed, at which point I owed $17.6k because of interest.

Thankfully I was on an IDR plan and my monthly payment was $0 because I had no income while I was in grad school. I paid at least $500/month and by the end of 2019 I still owed $12.5k. I felt like was still in so much debt and had a slight breakdown. I had been gifted Dave Ramsey's ""Total Money Makeover"" book, I read it, and I was resolved to really buckle down and pay as much as possible every month.

I just wanted to share my story because I feel like it's a weird thing to talk about with my family/friends.

t3_ges7xz,StudentLoans,Have a credit on my UAS accounts after consolidation and they're giving it to the servicer I consolidated with rather than me. Is that right?,"I have two accounts with UAS for my Perkins loans, one through UASConnect and one through UASEcho. I consolidated both to MyFedLoan so that all my loans are in one place and so that they could benefit from the current Coronavirus deferment situation. The consolidation payment just posted on both accounts and now I have a positive credit on each account. I called the UAS and asked if they could send write me a check for the amount I have in credit but they said that they would have to send it to the consolidator rather than me and that it would take 45-60 days for this to happen.

Is this right? At least on one of the accounts, the amount overpaid is the exact amount of a payment I had posted the same day that the consolidation check posted, and so they either arrived at the same time or mine was minutes or hours before the consolidation payment arrived at UAS. Is it true that any overpayment in consolidation should be sent to the consolidator rather than to the borrower? I'm alright accepting this if it's correct, but I want to make sure this is the case, as I could use a couple hundred dollars right now to pay for a college course I'd like to take this summer. If this isn't correct, how should I proceed? The lady I spoke with on the phone was pretty firm and was unable to consider other possibilities because she says this is what their policy is.

I consolidated both to MyFedLoan so that all my loans are in one place and so that they could benefit from the current Coronavirus deferment situation. The consolidation payment just posted on both accounts and now I have a positive credit on each account. I called the UAS and asked if they could send write me a check for the amount I have in credit but they said that they would have to send it to the consolidator rather than me and that it would take 45-60 days for this to happen.

Is this right? At least on one of the accounts, the amount overpaid is the exact amount of a payment I had posted the same day that the consolidation check posted, and so they either arrived at the same time or mine was minutes or hours before the consolidation payment arrived at UAS. Is it true that any overpayment in consolidation should be sent to the consolidator rather than to the borrower? I'm alright accepting this if it's correct, but I want to make sure this is the case, as I could use a couple hundred dollars right now to pay for a college course I'd like to take this summer. If this isn't correct, how should I proceed? The lady I spoke with on the phone was pretty firm and was unable to consider other possibilities because she says this is what their policy is.

t3_gepat2,StudentLoans,Will I still have to pay back my classes after going through with medical leave?,"Hello everyone!

During my 3rd semester in college I was re doing classes from my 2nd semester because I was depressed and didn't do them at the time. That ended with me getting into probation and I made up those classes in my 3rd semester.

I had a problem in the beginning of my 3rd semester where my advisor had put me in the wrong class, so I emailed him to put me back into the right one since I had no knowledge of the second level programming course he had put me in. I ended up getting back into that class and I thought things were okay until I went to sign up for my 4th semester classes.

I had found out that I was charged around $800 for dropping that class, even though I was put in that class wrongly. They didn't say anything about it and made me sign a paper saying they were going to take that money for the dropped course from my pell grant and pay it off, but I would have to complete the next course classes or I would have to pay for those in full.

When spring break started my depression came back from my family and I was having suicidal thoughts, I talked to a counselor about the probation and she said they couldn't do that and that I should talk to my advisor to get a refund, but I wasn't able to do so because of the coronavirus and me taking a couple of months to calm down.

Right now I am emailing my counselor to help me with medical leave and to sort out that weird probation, but I am worried I will have to pay back the classes because I didn't do them while taking care of my mental health during these last 2 months.

I really need that money to move out later this year to get away from my abusive family, but they're really controlling over me and have threatened me for my money/pell grant money, and are waiting to see if I have to pay back those classes

Any help would be appreciated

t3_geh9os,StudentLoans,Adverse credit for gradplus loan,"I'm looking over the requirements for adverse credit for grad plus loans and I am a bit confused.

I read the regulations backwards and forwards. Does someone have adverse credit if the only bad debt they have are chargeoffs from 3 years ago and open collection accounts based on those debts.

It seems that regulations say that when they say open collection account or charge offs within 2 years of the credit report date. In other words someone could not have their debt paid off but since the debt isn't current.....

I even read the response to comments on the Federal Register in 2014 and it talked about a 2 year lookback window as in they are only interested in chargeoffs and collections account in that 2 year window. The other baddies like liens and repossessions kept the 5 year look back window.

Am I misreading it?

I have collections that began 3 years ago but they appear current on my credit report, because each collection agency that buys the debt resets the clock. I have no foreclosures, unpaid federal loans etc. Do I have an adverse credit history? I haven't taken on any debt in the last 5 years, but have old collections I plan to let age off my report. The debts are over the $2085 threshold too.","Adverse credit for gradplus loanI'm looking over the requirements for adverse credit for grad plus loans and I am a bit confused.

t3_gdwys3,StudentLoans,No longer a Navient “Customer”,"I went back to school in my late twenties around 2009. I transferred to a state university and finished up with a business degree in 2013. At the time, I had just over $40K in loans, and was working odd jobs for a few years. I eventually packed up and moved across the country to an area that was doing well economically. I’ve been working office jobs here for the past four years; I got a certificate in this time and generally spent money on frivolous things when I wasn’t applying it to my loans. This was a mistake. I could have been out of this much earlier. 

I’ve been throwing every extra dollar I’ve earned towards my loans since last October or November. I had a premonition that the economy might be headed into recession given that we’re on a ten-year cycle for it historically. I divested all of my hobby stocks last year and stopped contributing to my 401K to dwindle the loans down quickly. 

I’ve been lucky enough to work from home for an essential company during the COVID-19 pandemic;  I realize that I am in a unique situation and many others have been adversely affected to the point where they are worried about things like rent. I haven’t taken this for granted, and have still lived as frugally as possible. 

Even though payments were deferred through the fall, there was no point in waiting. I paid off the last bit of them yesterday. The dark cloud has been lifted from over my head. There’s no time for celebration. The pandemic is ongoing, and there is still some economic uncertainty. I also have a car to pay down, hopefully before the end of the year. 

I would say to anyone who needs help with their own loans to listen to Dave Ramsey and you’ll get some motivation. He’s not perfect, but he gets a lot right. Think minimally in your lifestyle and you will get much further along than trying to fulfill all of your wants. Debt sucks; it makes you poor.

t3_gecpch,StudentLoans,Getting first time calls on a Perkins loan 10 years after school?,"Federal Perkins loan - Perplexing situation

Good morning Reddit,

There is a problem that has recently come to my attention and I'd like some advice or just to hear if someone has been in a similar situation before:

I've been out of school for 10 years now.  (Since 2010) I had originally defaulted on my federal student loans a few years after that.  I ignored my debt up until about 4 years ago and I called to get everything consolidated and on an income driven repayment plan through fedloan.  After getting everything out of default, my credit started to improve.  My score after 4 years is now in the 800s.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my problem; I've recently been contacted by a debt collection agency named ""Williams and Fudge"" based out of South Carolina.  The representative I spoke to informed me that I owe $3000 on a $1500 federal perkins loan that had, ""fell through the cracks"" and that they were managing it for my university.  I checked my account on the fsa website ([studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov)) and that perkins loan is now there. (It hasn't been on my account until this month)  It says this loan has been in default since 2011...this is where questions start to arise:

Why have I never been contacted about this debt since 2011? My information on record has been up to date for years.

How has this defaulted debt never shown on any credit report since 2011? I thought federal student loans aren't subject to the SoL and never fall off even after 7 years?

If this debt truly ""fell through the cracks"" after all these years, why am I responsible for paying double the original amount in additional interest and service fees that have been tacked on from Williams and Fudge?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Edit:

Going back through on my student loan history and talking to my parents, I had a total of 4 loans. (3 stafford loans and 1 perkins) My parents had taken care of the perkins loan with a lump sum payment to the university in 2011.  When I consolidated 4 years ago, fedloan consolidated my remaining stafford loans, said that was all I had and that I should be in good standing as long as I continue to make on time payments.

I think the university has an error on their end and is now trying to collect on a debt that has already been paid.  Maybe that's why they thought it ""fell through the cracks"".   I don't know what to do if this is the case.  How would I prove that now?  Like i stated, I've been out of school for 10 years.  I've taken care of all my past debt. (or so I was told until now)  I doubt my parents still have paperwork on a debt that was taken care of 9 years ago...I've worked too hard fixing my credit just to have something like this screw it up again...

t3_gealbv,StudentLoans,Down Payment or Pay off Student Loans?,"Hi all,

My husband and I have been saving for years for an eventual down payment on a house. He paid off his student loans before he met me, so the majority of the savings is from his years working. We live in  NYC so the housing market is insanely expensive, so our 70k won't go too far. We add about 2k-4k a month (based on OT, etc)

Three years ago I had close to 75k in student loan debt, right now I have about 38k left (I feel really accomplished by this - I started with around 9 different loan groups and am now down to two). 

One group is 7% interest, the other is 6% - right now everything is frozen so I'll be able to make more of a dent while in pandemic forbearance (who would have thought?  - insert Paul Rudd meme here). Long story short is: do we take anything out of our down payment savings to pay off this debt or do I pay off as much as I can during this no interest period &amp; then make regular payments as usual in September? We're so close to our goal of 100K in our savings (will hit that by next summer probably) that I don't like the idea of taking money out. The other side of me knows the 7% return is huge as well. 

To clarify one thing, the reason I'm most hesitant is because my husband has been working for the last 10 years and a lot of this is his savings. I've always managed paying my own student loans because I didn't want to burden him with my debt. He did help me pay off a 7K loan last year, which is huge &amp; I'm super grateful. I've only been making good money for the past \~3 years so that's why my loans have been decreasing steadily, not sure if i should just keep up what I've been doing or pay it off in full.

We live in NYC, so that is why we have high cost of living and expenses. 

We are thinking about paying down all my loans first within 3-4 years and then turn around and tackle her loans next. We understand that interest will continue to accrue on her loans,  but we think us paying off my loans first will significantly outweigh how much interest her loans will accrue. We hope to completely pay off all of our loans within 15 years.

We live in NYC, so that is why we have high cost of living and expenses. 

We are thinking about paying down all my loans first within 3-4 years and then turn around and tackle her loans next. We understand that interest will continue to accrue on her loans,  but we think us paying off my loans first will significantly outweigh how much interest her loans will accrue. We hope to completely pay off all of our loans within 15 years.

Looking for advice on how to tackle this and if this the right path? Any other suggestions will be great!

t3_gebctf,StudentLoans,Calculating Expected Interest Accounting For Paying Off,"So I am thinking about getting a federal Stafford loan for graduate school which is at 6.08% interest right now. I need some help seeing if my math/logic makes any sense.

So I have 3 years of graduate school and I will be taking out $4500 each year because I need to have “income” which is 3x the rent to get an apartment. However, $3500 of that I otherwise do not need to be taking out. Therefore, I would pay back $3500 of the loan immediately and be left with $1000 in actual used loans for the first year. 

1st Year Loan of $4500: Using A = P(1 + r)^t that means this loan will cost me $306 (year 1) + $140.624 (years 2 and 3 based on the 1000) = TOTAL of $446.624. 

2nd Year Loan of $4500: $306 (year 1) and $68 (year 2) = TOTAL of $374

3rd Year: $306 (year 1)

GRAND TOTAL $1126.624 in interest and 3x $1000 of unpaid loans

Is this math correct? Can I pay off part of a loan the same year I get it. And am I missing any other costs that come with federal loans assuming I pay on time?

I really appreciate the help.","Calculating Expected Interest Accounting For Paying OffSo I am thinking about getting a federal Stafford loan for graduate school which is at 6.08% interest right now. I need some help seeing if my math/logic makes any sense.

t3_ge8ib4,StudentLoans,Reconsolidating,"Hey guys, I’m new here so bear with me.

I graduated college in 2015 and finally got a hold on my finances per se. I currently have $50k in private student loans with 8-9% interest (3 separate accounts) and 1 federal loan with $20k. Unfortunately I fell into hard times within the past 2 years and missed 5 payments on my private loan (on my credit report stating 30-60 days late). It hurt my credit score severely and now I’m sitting on a 600 credit score. Now obviously if I want to consolidate my student loans I’ll have to build my credit score. So here are my questions, 1) what’s an average credit score to have to get a good chance of a lower interest rate consolidation? 2) now that I have all my student loans at current (nothing past due) will my past late fees affect the rising of my credit score? 3) when I finally get to a good credit score will the new lender deny me due to the past few late fees* even if I’ve been making full payments now for several months? (expecting 6-12 months until I finally reconsolidate)

*According to credit karma the late payments were within the past year, the last two were January and February 2020 so it was recent.

t3_ge7kvu,StudentLoans,Question re: Defaulted Private Discover Student Loan,"I consciously defaulted on a PRIVATE Discover Student Loan 8 months ago. I simply stopped making payments, I moved out of the country and have changed my phone number. I have not been receiving phone calls. My co-signer on the loan, who agreed that defaulting was the best decision for both of us, still lives in the U.S. (New York) and said that he is ignoring daily calls from Discover. My co-signer has not and will not make any payments. 

I thought Discover would have sent the loan to collections by now, but they haven't. And they continue to call the cosigner. Obviously I want them to stop calling my cosigner. I also want to avoid going to court if at all possible, especially since I now live out of the country and do not want to have to come back at some future date to go to court.  Here are my questions:

1. Is there a way to get Discover to stop calling my cosigner without acknowledging the debt?
2. Is there a way to influence Discover to send the loan to collection instead of taking me to court?
3. Would logging into my Discover student loan account online be considered an act of ""acknowledging"" the debt and reset the clock for the staute of limitations?

t3_gcp9ka,StudentLoans,Paid off 32k since last Feb!,"Hi all,

I just want to share exciting news that I have paid off almost 32k(31,500) since Feb 2019. This was a Wells Fargo private loan and I graduated 5/2018. I started working 08/2018 and I saved up about 10k. When my loan payments began in 12/2018, I paid the minimum for 2 months until 02/2018 when I forced myself to make a big 10k payment. The loan was split into one that was 14k+ and the other was ~17k. I paid $8,000 on the 14k one and then 2,000 to the bigger one to get the interest down. From there, I closed the smaller loan 04/2018 and then began on the bigger loan. It was hard but I still live at home, don’t shop much, and try to sell things on eBay as I can. I also picked up some babysitting (minimal, maybe made about $500-600) and transcribing for a couple months (maybe $500) but this all went to my loans. Any extra $ I had that I could spend, I put towards loans. I do have a 401k but I only do 3% and I do have a savings account but this is small ($100 a month) and will be until I pay off my debt. I still have about 20k in private loans and 25k in federal. I just refinanced my 20k loans from Sallie Mae from 7-11% interest down to 3.5% interest (used credible and its through pen fed now) so I will start paying this hard. Graduating with 80k of debt while half my counterparts all had school paid for is hard and the fact that I won’t be able to buy a house or move out as soon is also hard but I am doing it!  

I also traveled to Iceland, Denver, Phoenix, Mexico, and Ireland in the past year so I could’ve paid my loan quicker but I don’t want to miss out on experiences and be miserable with just work.

t3_gcivpy,StudentLoans,[Visual] I paid off approximately $32k of student loans in 2.5 years and tracked it all through data and graphs!,"Hi everyone, at the end of 2020 I finished my student loan payments! I've been a lurker on here for a while now and am happy to finally join the ""Paid in Full"" club alongside many of you! 

In addition to that though, I also have found an excitement in going through the data from my loan provider during this time and creating some charts for visualization purposes and some eye-opening takeaways. The first graph, [Total Loan Balance Over Time](https://imgur.com/BEgOfSc) shows the life **and death** of all of my 6 loans that I took out throughout my university studies, combined. The second graph, [Individual Loan Balances Over Time](https://imgur.com/zksFbBp) shows the life **and death** of those 6 loans broken out individually - as you can see I approached it via avalanche method. The purpose of doing this all was for me to visualize how interest works between Unsubsidized vs. Subsidized loans and how much it can grow over time. 

As a whole, some key numbers:

- Principal balance paid: $26,400
- Interest paid: $5,200 
- Total paid: $31,600
- Average payment: approx. $1000/mo

I was quite shocked when I realized that out of the total amount that I paid, 16% was in interest, and that's with paying it 4x faster than the 10-year term originally assigned, plus with my highest interest rate loan being 6.8%. I also learned that had it not been that I was continually exporting out my data from my loan provider, it would have been extremely difficult to access the .csv file and data. After I paid it all off, I was still missing some data from the last several few payments and my loan provider pretty much removed all access to my account history and it took several calls/emails in order to get that data as well as all proof of payment. So, lesson for anyone else interested in doing something similar, export out all your data before your last payment!

This was honestly an enjoyable little project for me - I would love to do something similar for anyone that is interested! There are a lot of other personal factors that I didn't want to get into at this time (income, living situation, methodology for payments, etc) but someday I may get more in depth and write a more thorough article or something like that, depending on the reception. I hope this was helpful for anyone or at least different than a regular ""I paid them off!"" post. I'd be happy to answer questions and would love to hear any comments! Good luck everyone!","[Visual] I paid off approximately $32k of student loans in 2.5 years and tracked it all through data and graphs!Hi everyone, at the end of 2020 I finished my student loan payments!

t3_gcwh1v,StudentLoans,"With 0% interest being applied, balance isn’t reflecting my payment fully","Hello! I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this before or has an explanation for it. I’m still waiting on an email back from the company. 

So. A few years ago my student loans went into default. Last three years my tax returns were taken and applied to it. Which brought down the balance a lot. So I was grateful (although I really wanted that money in my pocket obv but it was my own wrongdoings that put my loan into default). 

Fast-forward to Covid-19 times. Interest has been brought down to 0% on loans, etc. Since my balance was so low because of this years tax return, I had the extra money to put towards it right now so I’m able to fully pay it all off while we are in the 0% era. So the last few weeks I have been putting a portion of my money towards it.

A few days later the payment applies, and part of it goes to principle and just a little over 15% of the payment applies to “other fees and charges.” It is not the interest column because that column is separate and is noted at $0.00.

However, my issue comes in with the new debt summary, amount owed. The balance is still always $80-$100 more than it should be. 

Example: balance is $1000.

I pay $600. $510/600 will show under principal. $90/$600 will go to “other fees.”

So the full $600 was used.

But my remaining balance will say $480-$500 instead of the flat $400. (Like I noted I’m only noticing and asking these questions because there is no interest being applied currently and there is no explanation on the site nor a FAQ page.)

Now I understand there are fees with every loan. But why is it not included in my full balance that I owe? When you do take any loan out I understand you wind up paying more back than you ever borrowed. I can’t help but feel like they’re taking way more money then they should right now or I’m just not fully knowledgable on where the rest of my payment goes? Is it taxes? If so, 15% in taxes????

Thanks for reading :)","With 0% interest being applied, balance isn’t reflecting my payment fullyHello! I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this before or has an explanation for it. I’m still waiting on an email back from the company.

t3_gcvqcc,StudentLoans,Enrolling to Graduate School in the fall of 2020- Guidance in securing the best Direct Plus Loan Interest Rate,"Hello,

I'm starting school in the fall of 2020 and am in the process for applying for loans and am writing this with hopes to get some guidance regarding my options.

I will be attending from the Fall of 2020 and based on the information I've gathered the program will cost me close $150,000.

I've applied for the Direct Unsubsidized Loan and will be borrowing $20,500. 

To secure additional aid, I will be applying for the Direct Plus Loans. In terms of the Direct Plus Loans, based on the FAFSA website ( [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans) ), when I tried to apply through the website, the university was listed as one of the university that said they are not participating in Direct Plus Loans. I have two questions I would like ask:

1st. Does that mean I will need to apply for a private student loan?

2nd. Due to the current pandemic, I understand current student loan payments are currently on hold. Would anyone happen to know if future student loans are offered at lower interest rate? or offer any additional benefit?

Thank you in advance for your insight.

Best,

Jay","Enrolling to Graduate School in the fall of 2020- Guidance in securing the best Direct Plus Loan Interest RateHello,

t3_gceca5,StudentLoans,Question about pell grants and unsubsidized vs. subsidized loans,"Hello! I'm not sure if anyone can help me or not, but I'd appreciate any information given to me. :) Currently, I owe $16,000 in student debt (Bachelor's degree, business management) and my husband owes over $30k for an associate's he never finished. I'm just a little confused about pell grants and unsubsidized vs subsidized loans. When my husband and I went to our community college, we were like 18 or 19 but living on our own. No help from parents and didn't make a lot of money. Probably minimum wage. Somehow, all of my loans are unsubsidized so I've been charged a lot of interest already. My husband, well, I don't know how he owes 30k for an associate's degree at a community college. He went for several semesters, but don't think that's the reason he owes so much. I suspect there were maybe uncashed checks that were never subtracted from his balance. (I'm having him make some phone calls on Monday to find out why he owes so much. More than likely there were no errors, but I just want confirmation before we start paying this debt down.) This is where my question comes in: I know several people around my age who owe no money (or very little) on student debt because they didn't make much money and it was all covered by grants. Why would my husband and I not have qualified for this (we were dating at the time so our incomes weren't lumped together)? Does it have to do with when the applications were put in (first come first serve) or because of the application not being filled out correctly? If it comes down to an error of incomes not being recorded correctly, is there a way to go back and correct this (with proof) to where we wouldn't owe so much federal aid? (I know this isn't likely, but again, I just want to make sure I understand everything before I pay money all this debt off.) If we weren't going to get pell grants, that's whatever, but I really can't understand why we would have been hit with the loans that accumulated interest while still attending school.

t3_gcgbze,StudentLoans,Question about Grad Plus endorser,"Hello,  


I am needing Grad Plus loans to pay for school, and I have adverse credit. I will need an endorser. The only person I can get to endorse me is my mother, and besides a less-than-stellar credit score, everything else is fine. She is not 90 days or more delinquent on any accounts.  


However, my mother is now telling me that she remembers having some of her checks garnished, which she made arrangements with the loan servicer (federal loans) to stop the wage garnishments. She isn't a very tech savvy person, and she told me that she wasn't aware she was even in danger of garnishment. Apparently she was told that they tried to contact her multiple times, but she does not recall any letters (doesn't mean any weren't sent; they could have just not been noticed or whatever). She says if she was aware that they were going to garnish her wages and that she was supposed to be paying installments on her student loans, she had the money to do so and would have.  


She has no repossessions and is current on all of her accounts. I am afraid to accept an offer for pharmacy school because if I enroll and cannot secure any funds to pay for my tuition, I will have to withdraw. This will impact future career prospects.  


Is there any way that I can still use her as an endorser on a Grad PLUS loan? I thought about looking into whether or not we can dispute the garnishment (again, her wages aren't being garnished right now and she's making satisfactory payments for multiple months now) due to her not being aware of what was going on. Is there any way that I can explain this situation to the Department of Education to allow me to use her as an endorser?  


Thanks.","Question about Grad Plus endorserHello,  


I am needing Grad Plus loans to pay for school, and I have adverse credit. I will need an endorser. The only person I can get to endorse me is my mother, and besides a less-than-stellar credit score, everything else is fine. She is not 90 days or more delinquent on any accounts.  


However, my mother is now telling me that she remembers having some of her checks garnished, which she made arrangements with the loan servicer (federal loans) to stop the wage garnishments. She isn't a very tech savvy person, and she told me that she wasn't aware she was even in danger of garnishment. Apparently she was told that they tried to contact her multiple times, but she does not recall any letters (doesn't mean any weren't sent; they could have just not been noticed or whatever). She says if she was aware that they were going to garnish her wages and that she was supposed to be paying installments on her student loans, she had the money to do so and would have.

I am now taking on the responsibility of paying of my parent’s Plus Loans for me (which sadly will be a total of $16k-19k depending on how much interest has accrued/how much they have paid off, wow I really regret taking out $10k to live on campus Freshman year). Since I am making more money now I hope to pay this off in the next year or less.

I've looked into refinancing the private loan, but the offered rates aren't different enough to make it worthwhile. My federal loan payment was $733/month.

So I would pay the $4398 off but then go back to the same amount going towards both the federal and private loans.

t3_gbggxu,StudentLoans,Consolidate $180k+ or leave it with three service companies? Pros/cons,"I defaulted on 180k of debt a few years ago.  The principal is about 110k and the rest is interest. 

TL/DR at bottom.  

Background - I defaulted because at the time I was married to someone who worked only occasionally (by choice), and I was the sole breadwinner.  What little money I made went to keeping a roof over our heads.   

My job qualifies for public student loan forgiveness. 

My main balance of 144k is with one service company and then I have two smaller loans, 20k each with two different service companies.  

Question - Once the loans are out of default next month, should I consolidate the three together or keep them separate?  I was planning on consolidation but someone told me that consolidating the loans could have a negative impact.  From what I have deduced, consolidating them would be beneficial but I don’t want to consolidate them and then find out I screwed myself by consolidating.  

At least there is a light at the end of the tunnel now with PSLF.  My loans have had a significant impact on my quality of life and for the first time finishing grad school I feel like there is some hope for financial security and I don’t want to do something to screw that up. 

Thanks for any tips or pros/cons for consolidating!!

TL/DR: I have almost 200k in defaulted loans. I’m almost done rehabilitating them.  I have a public job that qualifies for student loan forgiveness.  After rehabilitation, should I consolidate the loans or keep paying the different service companies?

t3_gbt2ul,StudentLoans,Are there any dangers in deferring student loan repayment if seeking PSLF?,"I am in a REPAYE program while working at a Community College. My loans are currently in deferment while I am working toward a PhD in Education on a part-time basis until 2024 or 2025, and as a result, I am not making any qualified PSLF payments. I am 46, live frugally, and plan to retire at 62. I drive a 22 year car when needed and try to pay cash as much as possible (Dave Ramsey approach without the PSLF hate). I should add that I am a single empty nester parent with just one income and on a limited budget in a high cost of living area (Northeast) so money is a little tight now. My PhD program is fully funded with nothing out of my pocket this time.  


Financially, I am better off to continue deferring and putting that money into retirement and postponing repayment until I graduate, but I also worry that the government will not honor PSLF someday as I am sure many on here do. So I see my options as the following:

1. Starting making qualifying payments now and get this out of the way.
   1. What happens if I make those payments and the govt wigs out anyway leaving me another 15 years of repayment? I would have been better off deferring in that case anyway.
2. Defer repayment. Put that money into retirement. Make payments beginning at age 51 and reach forgiveness around 61.
   1. Will I regret defferring if the govt wigs out in 11 years when I would have qualified for forgiveness under option 1?  


Background:

I have 236K in student loans. $120 for me personally (B.S. Comp Sci and MBA), and the remainder was taking in the form of Parent PLUS loans for my two kids. I was a single parent and foolish. I consolidated through Great Lakes into Two IBRs which had me paying $800 per month while making $60K per year which I did for 11 months through Great Lakes. It got transferred to Fedloan when I sent in the certification for PSLF. I work at a Community College.    


Fedloan said that Great Lakes put me under a terrible plan, and they ended up reconsolidating me under a single REPAYE that dropped me down to $432 per month. The catch was that my 11 payments counted for nothing and the ""clock"" was reset. Its a long story, and I was almost in tears when Fedloan explained it to me and hence why I am leary of any forgiveness now.  


So anyway, my first payment was due in February, but just after my loan was finalized and the plan released to me, my repayment was put in Deferment as my university sent a letter to them informing that I am a part-time student there until 2024. After talking to Fedloan to ensure nothing in the process was incomplete given the letters timing, I did the math and decided to use this for a year to pay off all my other debts beside my mortgage. I was also able to leverage my college into giving me a new position with a better salary ($79K). I expect to be ""debt free"" by December.

I also will have an unspecified amount due in tax burden from grants and scholarships I received during my senior year of college (this year). 

I'm trying to decide if it makes more sense to take the discharge and set aside the amount I'd have paid in loans each month so I can cover the tax burden, or if I should waive the discharge in order to preserve the possibility of returning to school someday.

t3_gbq8xq,StudentLoans,What to do during grace period / before eloping?,"I'm in need of some advice. I have \~$17700 in federal student loans (\~$2200 in one with I think 6.25% interest normally, $15500 in another with 6%), which are currently at 0%/no payment required because of the COVID-19 grace period. I'm already seeking PSLF, have switched my loans to FedLoan, and am on REPAYE. Right now I make about $40k. My fiance makes about $55k and has no student loan debt. We'd been planning on eloping next year (provided we can travel to Ireland by then), and I'm wondering what the best financial steps are for me to take right now. It's also worth noting that I may consider a career change; right now I qualify for PSLF because my employer counts as a non-profit, but I am discovering that I quite like working from home. I've made 33+ payments on one of my loans, and 24+ on the other (not counting whatever isn't popping up since I last certified).

Things I'm worried about:

1. I think I need to switch my repayment plan away from REPAYE because of the impending marriage. I started college in 2006, and I think that means I don't qualify for PAYE -- but could for IDR? How difficult is that process?
2. I don't really understand the difference between filing separately or jointly... I do know that I historically get a refund, and he didn't this year. Is it financially better or worse to file separately or jointly?
3. Should I use this time where my loans are 0%/no payment to pay down my loans? Thanks to the grace period, I just paid off my interest and only have the principal remaining. I could, ostensibly, pay off the $2200 one. Or should I continue to save? I'm trying to get better at money and just now hit $10k in my savings account. Is it better to throw money at my loans or to keep stockpiling because we're looking at some upcoming life expenses?

Advice appreciated. I do not have a head for money at all, and this stuff immediately sets off my anxiety and makes it hard for me to process information, as much research as I try to do!

My current thought process is that I should hold onto money at least until the end of this grace period because who knows what may happen in terms of an extension or relief (a person can dream!), but I am considering the possibly immediate future and what makes good financial sense before a big life change.","What to do during grace period / before eloping?I'm in need of some advice.

t3_gbow5l,StudentLoans,Refinancing Advice - $191k,"Hi all,

I’m currently paying down $191k of fed loans on the extended graduated plan with about 20 years remaining. My “discounted” interest rate is 6.63%, which means I’m accumulating somewhere around $1,050 in interest every month. I currently pay $1,200 just to attack a tiny bit of principal but obviously it’s like a drop of water in the ocean and the interest is killing me. 

I’ve explored some refinancing options, but my giant principal means that the monthly payments would be more than I can afford (they’re already severely impacting my lifestyle as is). I have a great credit score and should be competitive for good rates. Should I look into potentially splitting up my loans amongst 2 private companies that way I can at least have a lower overall interest rate while paying roughly the same every month? Does that even make sense?

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Should I look into potentially splitting up my loans amongst 2 private companies that way I can at least have a lower overall interest rate while paying roughly the same every month? Does that even make sense?

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.

t3_gbiirq,StudentLoans,Is it possible to change which company is collecting your debt?,"Hello everyone. I have been dealing with a lot of very concerning behavior from a company called F.H. Cann &amp; Associate recently.

When I fell into default due to unemployment, they recommended I apply for their program. Once I found a new job, I called back to apply. I filled out all of the needed forms and gave them all of the information they requested. I was then able to start the monthly payment of $50 which I had been paying consistently for 4 or 5 months, until they sent me a letter claiming I never applied. 

I called them about this, and they stated I never filled out a 4506-T form. I told them I did, I even read out the e-mail to them, the date in which it was sent, and mentioned confirmation I received from their people that it had been submitted. 

They adamantly denied this anyway and emailed me another one. I filled that one out, guy on the phone confirms it with me. A few days ago instead of me getting a letter this time, my brother who lives in a completely different state, finds the letter in my parents mailbox from the IRS stating they had to deny a request due to an incorrect address. So I don't know if FH somehow screwed that up, when they've been sending mail to the correct address for months with no issue, or if they're doing this on purpose.

They sent a voice message to me yesterday, stating that they are calling in an attempt to collect payment from me. Payment I can't give them, because I have been furloughed from my job due to COVID 19, and i'm still waiting on a stimulus check that I no longer have any hopes will ever show up in my mailbox. 

Whether it's their incompetence or something shady going on I want a different company to work with. I just want to pay off my debt, and that is never going to happen with F.H. Cann.","Is it possible to change which company is collecting your debt?Hello everyone. I have been dealing with a lot of very concerning behavior from a company called F.H.

t3_gav9rc,StudentLoans,"$126,000 in Sallie Mae (8-9.25% Interest) and poor credit score... best path forward?","Hi guys, I graduated from an upper-tier college in 2016 with about $150,000 in student loans. Because of some forbearance and insane interest rates, I have not made much progress with my student loans. When I was irresponsible and naive, I was late on several payments and now my credit score is around 610. I have not missed a single payment of any sort in 18 months, and will have a collection roll off next October.

I made around $40K in 2017, $50K in 2018, $72K in 2019, and (after a promotion to Account Executive in software sales), I should make somewhere between $175K and $200K this year.

I want to refinance, but am curious how to do so with a low credit score. My debt-to-income ratio is getting very good, but is that factored in to refinancing decisions?

For years, I was too shy to post about my situation, but that’s in the past and my head is above water now. Any advice would be incredible.

Another question - beyond my 4% 401(k) match and some savings, should I be putting all of my money into paying off student loans right now?

EDIT: Unbelievable help. From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it. I'm in sales, so the $175K to $200K is a guess, but $150K is a conservative, safe bet. As far as the collections account, it's for an ambulance in college that I didn't want to tell my parents about from a panic attack from getting too high lol. Yikes, I know. There is also a Comcast bill that I am disputing from the year out of college (4 years ago) that I am disputing and honestly expect to get it off the report. I have no mortgages, car loans, etc. I have plenty of late payments around 2-3 years ago back when I was being irresponsible. As for credit card debt, my limit is only $1450 ($750 and $700).

t3_gb7csy,StudentLoans,Should I refinance?,"I have approximately $64k in student loans that I’m still paying on.  I graduated in 2010 and have been paying minimum payments every month for 10 years now.  These are private loans.  16k with Navient and 48k with AES.  

My question is that the ones with AES have the interest pretty much all paid off ($250 left in interest).  Now I’m onto the principal.  Would it make any sense at all for me to try and refinance? Is there anything that can be done since the interest is almost paid off? I really don’t know how this stuff all works with refinancing so I’m open to any advice.  I’d also include the Navient loan with the refinance too.

They can’t get my payments, but is there anything else I should do? They can’t report this as an unpaid debt or anything, can they? 

Is this worth reporting to any government agencies (the California AG or something like that)?

t3_gb5hz1,StudentLoans,To Continue to Pay or Not? Considering Opportunity Costs During Cares Act Interest Pause- Federal Loans,"Hi There,

I did the math if anyone is interested I thought it might help. I looked at the scenario where a person had 10K of student loans at 5% - using the standard repayment plan- and whose interest was starting in April as the cares act hit.  Perhaps a bit unrealistic but it was the easiest place to start- imagine a person graduated in March somehow as campuses closed.  The 3 cases I considered are total interest paid and # of months to debt freedom for:

1. Had corona not happened (NO-Vid)
2. Using Cares Act and not paying during the interest pause (Cares Act Case)
3. Continuing payment through this interest pause (Fortunate Case)

In total here is what I found.

* NO-Vid- Total Interest Paid: $2727.70 debt free 120 months from April (April 1 2030 debt-free)
* Cares Act Case- Total Interest Paid $2727.70 debt free 126 months from April (Oct 1 2030 debt-free)
* Fortunate Case-  Total Interest Paid $2334.87 debt free 117 months from April (Jan 1 2030 debt-free)
* Total money saved  $392.83 total time saved 9 months

There are a lot of other variables you could take into consideration that also makes the continued payment interest. For instance- opportunity benefit of investments you could make with that additional 3 months of debt freedom using continued payment.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* I am in no means recommending continued payment- just showing you the math. Things you should consider before making any decision. Do you have a budget set? Is your income safe (relatively sure of continued income)? Do you have an emergency fund set up that aligns with your risk tolerance? These are all boxes you should check before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to do this calculation for other loan repayment plans, or loans at different periods in their lifecycle if this would be helpful to people? Let me know","To Continue to Pay or Not? Considering Opportunity Costs During Cares Act Interest Pause- Federal LoansHi There,

t3_gaxlew,StudentLoans,Should I take out a loan (UCONN vs WPI)?,"Hi everyone! I am currently deciding between going to UConn or WPI as an undergrad computer science major. If I go to Uconn, I will be able to graduate debt-free, but if I go to WPI, I will have to take out around $60k in loans. I know that WPI's CS program is a little better than UCONN'S CS program, but I feel that UCONN's CS program is still a great option. I also feel that I'd fit in at both schools. 

But I have heard so many people talk about how graduating college with no debt opens up so many opportunities. At the same time, from what I've calculated, WPI's debt seems to be manageable, but I know it will restrict my spending for several years. And especially during this time of economic instability due to coronavirus, I am worried that when I graduate, I will have to pay a lot more money/pay back for a longer period of time than before. And I have heard that the prestige of your undergrad school doesn't matter that much, even though WPI isn't massively above UCONN in terms of prestige.

So my questions to you guys are: Do you think it is worth it to go to WPI even if I have to take out $60k in loans for a moderately better CS program, or should I go to UCONN and graduate debt free? And how important is it to graduate debt-free?

If you guys could help me ASAP, I would greatly appreciate it, as the enrollment deposit deadline is tomorrow. Thank you in advance!","Should I take out a loan (UCONN vs WPI)?Hi everyone!

I'm going to be about 50k debt when I graduate (maybe less if I can save money during internships).

I'm considering doing the 1-year master's program and getting my masters in CS, but that would put me in a total of like 110k in debt (worst-case scenario - the best case is that I find some TA/ Research position and get it down to like 80k). The medium starting salary from our master's program is 115k - Although this includes people who are late in their career and get a masters too.

My parents would be taking out the loans so we can take out the 110k if needed and I would be paying them back. Also, since I'm CS, I'd probs end up working in a high cost of living area like Seattle/L.A

t3_gazwwr,StudentLoans,How do I enjoy my 20s but also pay off my student loans? I'm really struggling with this concept,"Sorry this is a long one, but I need to know if my plan is sound and how to learn how to live my life to the fullest during this financially difficult time. I'm in my early 20s, just finishing up my bachelors degree. I owe $31,000 from this degree, all in federal loans with about a 4.53% interest rate. Now, I've decided to attend an accelerated nursing program starting in 2 weeks, which is costing me A LOT, and I have no federal loans left. I just had to take out a $42,000 private loan with a 10.74% interest rate :( 

So, my plan is to save money while I'm in this accelerated program for the next 16 months. I have enough saved for things I may need throughout my program, like textbooks, train passes, uniforms, emergencies, etc. I'm living back with my parents and can do this for free for as long as I want. My plan is to babysit 1-2 days a week and make $200 a week and save as much of that as possible during my program. My bills each month are less than $300, so the rest is for savings.

I'm expecting to make around $60k after I graduate next fall, which is actually lowballing it for my area and not including overtime or babysitting/side job gigs, which many young nurses end up doing for extra money. I'm very hardworking and have no problem working 60+ hours in a week. 

So, my plan is to save some of the money I earn during my nursing program toward a trip to Europe, travel immediately after I graduate next fall to celebrate before I get a real RN job (if I don't do this now I seriously never will have the time), and then go into a serious loan repayment period for 3 years. 

I plan to live from home, put $2000 a month into my loans each month (pay minimum on low interest federal and sink everything else into my private loans). This will completely knock out my private loans in 3 years. I'll have to live like a broke student for those 3 years, but I'm used to it. I'll basically have just enough to pay my loans, bills and have a little fun each week. 

After those private loans are knocked out, I plan to attend grad school. At this point, I'll have enough experience as an RN to become an NP. I'm looking at nurse anesthetist and psychiatric NP programs in my area. These jobs make well over six figures, so I'm not as worried about the boat of loans that will inevitably come with grad school.

 I know I have a reasonably sound plan to pay off this insane debt quickly (or at least I think?), but I'm having a really hard time grasping the concept of sacrificing everything now for a much better future. If I do this all the right way, I'll have no foreseeable financial stress from the age of 30 on. I just am worried that I'll waste away my 20s, while everyone else is getting married, starting families, traveling, and moving out. I'm just so focused on my career and having a really successful and independent future, but I do want to stop and smell the roses along the way and live out my 20s to the fullest, even if I'm financially suffering. I get so anxious that I'll look back and regret not just taking my time with my loans and enjoying life while I was young. This might sound ridiculous, but it's important to me. How do I find this balance?","How do I enjoy my 20s but also pay off my student loans?

I plan to live from home, put $2000 a month into my loans each month (pay minimum on low interest federal and sink everything else into my private loans). This will completely knock out my private loans in 3 years. I'll have to live like a broke student for those 3 years, but I'm used to it. I'll basically have just enough to pay my loans, bills and have a little fun each week. 

After those private loans are knocked out, I plan to attend grad school. At this point, I'll have enough experience as an RN to become an NP. I'm looking at nurse anesthetist and psychiatric NP programs in my area. These jobs make well over six figures, so I'm not as worried about the boat of loans that will inevitably come with grad school.

 I know I have a reasonably sound plan to pay off this insane debt quickly (or at least I think?), but I'm having a really hard time grasping the concept of sacrificing everything now for a much better future. If I do this all the right way, I'll have no foreseeable financial stress from the age of 30 on. I just am worried that I'll waste away my 20s, while everyone else is getting married, starting families, traveling, and moving out. I'm just so focused on my career and having a really successful and independent future, but I do want to stop and smell the roses along the way and live out my 20s to the fullest, even if I'm financially suffering. I get so anxious that I'll look back and regret not just taking my time with my loans and enjoying life while I was young. This might sound ridiculous, but it's important to me.

t3_gaznir,StudentLoans,CARES Act &amp; Using 401(k) Funds to Pay Down Student Loans,"I'd like to preface by saying that I realize that pulling money from a retirement account is the wrong answer 99% of the time. 

However, the CARES Act seems to have removed at least some of the factors that make it the wrong answer. 

My understanding is that the 10% early withdrawal penalty has been waived. Also, income tax will not be applied to the withdrawn funds as long as an equal amount is paid into a qualified retirement account within 3 years. These provisions are stated in the CARES Act Division B, Title I, Sec. 2103 (see link). 

I'm very tempted to pull $50k from my retirement to put towards student loan debt. Background info: my income is $160k, student loan debt is $95k with avg. int. rate of 5.8%. Also, my employer has historically contributed 10% of my income to my retirement. 

The main drawback I can see is that I will obviously have less money in the market and therefore will miss out on its growth as our market recovers. 

Is there a piece to this puzzle that I'm missing?

t3_ga88h8,StudentLoans,Just Paid Off My First Loans,"
Just wanted to share the good vibes and encourage those who are struggling that it is possible. It was hard to picture paying any of them off when we first started out, but with some simple budgeting and a little self discipline it’s possible!

My wife and I had five loans between us for a total of $40,000 when we graduated three years ago (which I don’t think is that bad for a combined 12 years of college). We don’t make a lot of money considering we each have Masters degrees, but we’ve been pretty aggressively paying off our loans with the income that we have.

We decided to use the stimulus payment and some money from our fairly healthy savings and pay off two of the five loans.

We now only owe about $13,000 and we expect to pay the rest off in about 14 months (assuming neither of us get a better paying job). We’ve been using the avalanche method and are both now excited for the “avalanche” to start gaining momentum.","Just Paid Off My First Loans

t3_gam9b6,StudentLoans,Considering taking out a 401k loan to pay off remaining student loans... Advice?,"Hi folks, new to this sub, and considering potentially a large financial decision. I feel pretty out of my depth here, and could use some advice.

Short version is, I'm a college dropout with approximately 10k in student loans. I attempted to attend college while working fulltime because I'm a total lunatic, it didn't work out, and I eventually had to make a choice between the two. Steady gainful employment won out.

I'm looking at ways to reduce (or completely eliminate) my debt, and as of the passing of the CARES Act, I'm looking toward my 401k. I've only had it for seven years so I don't have a ton of money in it, but I do have enough to pay off my remaining student loans. My question is, would it make sense to take a loan out of my 401k for $10,000, in order to completely pay off my tuition?

The tuition loans have a 5.05% interest rate, and while I DO make enough to make the payments, it keeps my finances pretty tight, and makes it almost impossible to save any significant amount each month. With the interest being waived until September, I know I could stop making payments for awhile, but I'd rather find a way to get rid of the debt, for the sake of my credit score and overall peace of mind. I'm no genius when it comes to finance and tax law, but what I THINK I'm reading suggests that I could take the money out of my 401k at a lower interest rate, crush my student loans, and then essentially pay myself back over time, albeit with lower monthly payments.

Does this make sense to do? Are there any angles I'm not seeing? I have a decent job with relatively good security, and provided I don't get sick, I'll continue to work through the COVID19 crisis. I've made some questionable financial decisions in the past, and am in the process of repairing my credit, so I wanna make sure this isn't gonna hurt me down the line, before I make any decisions.

Any advice I could get on this topic would be HUGELY appreciated. Thanks in advance.","Considering taking out a 401k loan to pay off remaining student loans...

t3_g9nskr,StudentLoans,Under $10k for the first time since 2006,"Disclaimer: I just wanted to celebrate and due to social distancing, this is the only way I know how.

I have been aggressively repaying my student loans for 4 years and 11 months and I finally have dropped below $10k, specifically $9758.08. 

According to my calculations, I will pay them off in November. Last week, my employer guaranteed our paychecks until August 1st and with my little bit in savings and aggressive frugality, I should be able to pay off my lease and my loans if I am unemployed past that date. The plan then would be to move back with my parents (at 32) if I can't find a job, but I'm hopeful that my scientist and medical friends will solve this by then.

Stay safe everyone.

t3_ga261l,StudentLoans,Private student loan/bankruptcy,"I have an interesting situation and would like to know if anyone else has run into the same thing. It’s a long story, please bear with me. 

In 2001 I took out a private loan with Sallie Mae for $50k ($25k tuition/$25k living in Seattle) to attend a tech program. My dad and stepmom co-signed, as my credit was not the best. It was a 9 month program and the living money was split into 3 installments, with the tuition paid up front. The school proceeded to file for bankruptcy at the 7 month mark, right before my last disbursement. So all told, the amount borrowed was $42k. 

I was stuck in forbearance for a few years until I got on my feet, then started making payments. The loan was sold to Navient about 10 years in. With all the payments I made, the balance only went down to $32k. During this time, I managed to get my credit in great standing and got my stepmom removed from the loan, but they wouldn’t release my dad. Fast forward to 2019, I had lost my great job, run up debt trying to survive while working multiple jobs, and decided to declare bankruptcy. On my lawyer’s advice, I stopped paying Navient when the case was filed. She said, depending on the trustee, they could ask for the money I paid to Navient back from them to distribute to other creditors. 

I had my hearing in October 2019 and everything went smoothly and went through with no issues. I had kept an eye on my credit report and Navient was listed as on hold pending the hearing. I knew there was a possibility of them going after my dad for the balance. By January 2020, Navient was listed as closed on my credit reports. They did reach out to my dad, but he passed in early January. My stepmom sent them a copy of his death certificate and she hasn’t heard from them since. I finally got the balls to log in to my Navient account this week.... and the loan is gone. Not even the payment history is there. The history only exists on my credit report now. 

Has anyone else had this happen? I haven’t had any contact with the company since I filed for bankruptcy. For the record, I had downloaded an Excel file of my payment history last summer, and to that date I had paid back the principle and $17k in interest. 

TL;DR my private student loan disappeared after I declared bankruptcy.","Private student loan/bankruptcyI have an interesting situation and would like to know if anyone else has run into the same thing. It’s a long story, please bear with me.

The school normally costs 65-70k. I got a 21,000 scholarship, in addition to a 3.5k room and board scholarship, and an additional 5.8k grant. This brought my yearly total down to $40,920 for Pace. I already plan on working 1-2 jobs during school and getting an apartment with roommates starting sophomore year, which would take my yearly loan down to roughly 25k. I also plan on consolidating/refinancing my loans as soon as possible after college. I cannot take out any parent plus loans, since my parents won’t be supporting me through college. Which means a portion of my loans will have to be taken out in private bank loans. This college is the only college for me (trust me I’ve looked at quite a few) and my major/dream job cannot be done in any other location.

t3_g9wk5y,StudentLoans,REPAYE vs PAYE questions for married folks with dual income,"Hey there, I will be starting residency this July and really need some advice in exploring student loan repayment options. I have a spouse and she will be making an income as well which complicates my choice of repayment. Below I'll outline my story just so there's a grasp on what it is I'm looking for:

Essentially, I will be 140k (principal 127k) in debt starting residency this july with an average interest rate of 5.9%. Salary for next 4 years starts at 57k then increases by 1k each year. This will most likely quadruple after 4 years to 250k-300k as an attending salary. My wife, whom I just recently married last month, is studying to be a dietitian and she will complete her internship and start full time around July 2021 making around 50k. She has been working part time, made 20k in 2019, and will make around 10k in 2020. She will have about 54k in loans at a 6.0% interest rate by the time she finishes her internship.

My long term goal is to work in an opioid treatment program, of which NHSC is providing up to 75k in student relief in exchange for 3 years of working there. Because of this and the fact that my loan isn't too hefty, PSLF isn't a big concern to me. My plan was to do REPAYE in residency to take advantage of the interest subsidy, and refinance after residency to avoid the no cap on monthly payments REPAYE has put in place (I'd like to save up for a house, support family, invest retirement rather than put more money than my liking toward student loans that I can still pay off relatively quickly after refinancing). But....

I've used the loan simulator [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) provided and it says REPAYE is best option in residency. However, the monthly payments on my loan will spike when accounting for her income when she starts full time in July of 2021. **Is REPAYE really the best option for me? Would I be saving money if we filed taxes separately and did PAYE instead? Just not sure which one is better for us in the long run or short term and need some help crunching numbers together. I would greatly appreciate any help at all, I tend to struggle in grasping financial jargon.**

Thanks.","REPAYE vs PAYE questions for married folks with dual incomeHey there, I will be starting residency this July and really need some advice in exploring student loan repayment options. I have a spouse and she will be making an income as well which complicates my choice of repayment. Below I'll outline my story just so there's a grasp on what it is I'm looking for:

Essentially, I will be 140k (principal 127k) in debt starting residency this july with an average interest rate of 5.9%. Salary for next 4 years starts at 57k then increases by 1k each year. This will most likely quadruple after 4 years to 250k-300k as an attending salary. My wife, whom I just recently married last month, is studying to be a dietitian and she will complete her internship and start full time around July 2021 making around 50k. She has been working part time, made 20k in 2019, and will make around 10k in 2020. She will have about 54k in loans at a 6.0% interest rate by the time she finishes her internship.

My long term goal is to work in an opioid treatment program, of which NHSC is providing up to 75k in student relief in exchange for 3 years of working there. Because of this and the fact that my loan isn't too hefty, PSLF isn't a big concern to me. My plan was to do REPAYE in residency to take advantage of the interest subsidy, and refinance after residency to avoid the no cap on monthly payments REPAYE has put in place (I'd like to save up for a house, support family, invest retirement rather than put more money than my liking toward student loans that I can still pay off relatively quickly after refinancing). But....

t3_g9uotp,StudentLoans,Clueless First Generation College Freshman. Send Help.," 

Hello everyone,

I have a few questions and I know some of them may seem silly, but as the title suggests, I am a first generation college student trying to figure things on my own and I have no clue who to ask, so here I am on Reddit!

A bit of background information: I am a 21 year old freshmen. I do not qualify for FAFSA/federal loans for personal reasons, so my only option to pay for school is to take out private loans.

Anyways. I was accepted to my state's university. When I found out I was accepted, I got really excited and couldn't wait for Fall, so I made a last minute decision to attend summer semester.... which starts next week. I emailed my university asking if it was too late, and they informed me that (University) does not drop classes for non-payment and that instead I will get a $40 late fee and after 5 weeks I will start getting 1% interest and collection fees for every week that passes by. I can still attend my classes even if my payment does not come in time for the deadline.

So, I know I messed up by not planning ahead and figuring stuff out. Again, I have no idea how any of this works and I'm completely on my own for this. My question is, when should I take out a loan and how much? Or should I just take out one loan for the entire four years I will be in University?

So sorry for the silly questions and sorry for any grammar errors English is my second language! Any help would be appreciated, thank you so much. :)","Clueless First Generation College Freshman. Send Help.

Is it just best to continue making larger payments than required when I can?

The interest rate eats away at most of what I apply to the loan so it doesn't really seem to be decreasing much more than $20 a month when I pay about $100 towards it. How can I get rid of the debt the fastest? If I got the debt in my name only should I file for bankruptcy to try to clear it and restart? I don't know how to make it go away as soon as possible. I didn't finish school and only went for about a year and work a job I can't make more than 30k a year currently.

t3_g9kek0,StudentLoans,Is now a good time to transfer to FedLoan for PSLF?,"So I have one consolidated loan that has been on REPAYE with Great Lakes for almost 2 years while working for a qualifying employer. I have not submitted my first ECF to trigger the transfer from Great Lakes to FedLoan because so far I’ve had a good experience with Great Lakes and why change a good thing?

The CARES act got me thinking it may be a good time to transfer my loans to FedLoan to take advantage of the administrative forbearance our loans are in right now anyways. Great Lakes told me the other day that at the end of the CARES act it’s going to take 30-45 days to issue our first payment due date, so even though CARES ends Sept 30, our first payment won’t actually be due till sometime in November, effectively making us miss one qualifying payment, pushing the forgiveness date out one month. This is apparently standard when leaving any type of forbearance. 

My understanding is when transferring to Fed Loan, there may also be a delay in getting your payment set up right away and therefore making you miss a month and push your forgiveness date out again. Because our loans are qualifying for PSLF right now due to the CARES act, seems like the perfect time to transfer and eat the one month missed payment at the end of CARES instead of two, one at the end of CARES and then another down the road when I transfer to Fed Loan.

Wondering if anyone else has thought of this or has thoughts if this might be a good or bad idea?","Is now a good time to transfer to FedLoan for PSLF?So I have one consolidated loan that has been on REPAYE with Great Lakes for almost 2 years while working for a qualifying employer.

t3_g9ae2c,StudentLoans,"hey student loan gurus, i need some advice about how to handle 3 fed loans","i was an a-hole and haven’t paid on 3 of my student loans in... years. my credit already blows because of that, so i get it. i’m trying to fix the mess.

i had to file forebearance frequently due to life circumstances (original grant: $16k). obviously i have accrued a lot of capitalized interest, so i haven’t even touched my principle with the payments i have made. my DTI ratio on my credit report is well over 100% now, and since my partner and i want to purchase a house in the next 2-3 yrs, i have to clean that up. (i have 0 other debt, personal loans or collections.) 

come mid september, my plan is to pay off the current interest accrued on these 3 fed loans through navient ($5,296) and potentially do a direct loan consolidation. 
would that help my DTI ratio by resetting my loan repayment? i believe i’d get a 6.15% weighted interest rate using my current rates, so it’s not a huge loss (to me; am i wrong?) i want to get these paid off in 5 years max. 

1. original loan: $5,500. now total is $8,633 (subsidized) 
- [ interest: $1,559 (to be paid off 9/25)]
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,074 @ 5.6% int

- [ interest $2,039 (to be paid off 9/25) ] 
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,617 @ 6.8% int 

total principle: $21,882 

TLDR: is direct consolidation for a former serial federal loan forebearancer a good idea, or should i just stick to my existing navient/dept of ed loan terms (payment until 2030 as the plan stands)? is there even a point? i’m not looking to refinance to a private loan. 

i’ve seen people get some really good financial advice here, so i figured i’d shoot my shot and see if anyone’s had a similar situation, or knows what i should do for mine.

t3_g9a1u4,StudentLoans,Should I continue paying during COVID deferral?,"I have just under 26k of student debt remaining all fed government owned loans. The average interest rate is just North of 5 percent. 3.1k is at 6.8%. My monthly minimum is 526. If I eliminate the 6.8% debt  which is across three loans, my new monthly minimum will be 441 or an 85 savings each month.

My plan was to continue paying 525 over the next 6 months of deferal and Target the 6.8% loans to wipe them out and reduce the monthly minimum when we are on the other side of the COVID deferral.

Where I am struggling is I know it is not advised to prepay interest free debt which this essentially is right now. However in my view it's only a matter of time until that interest clock starts again. Also I know I could pay a lump sum of the 3.1k right before the defferal period ends for the same result but that is just a harder cash flow pill to swallow pyschologically I suppose.

My other debts are an auto loan at 3% and mortgage at 4.75%.  I already have an emergency fund saved and would be able to pay this down out of operational cash flow pending nothing happens to my employment in the foreseeable future.

t3_g966it,StudentLoans,COVID Cost me income; Need additional loan for rent,"For background, I am currently a law student and took out the Stafford loan and GradPLUS loans to cover my tuition and cost of living for this school year. I only took out enough to cover up until I started working this summer. I did not use my parents as cosigners. Unfortunately, because of COVID, my clerkship has been postponed and as a result I cannot cover rent for this summer yet. My parents advised that I take out another private loan to cover rent, which makes sense to me. They are unwilling to lend me money as they are planning for retirement and my father lost his job as a result of this a few years ahead of schedule. While we are not in dire straights, it is apparent that beyond cosigning, I am on my own. 

With a cosigner, I easily get approved for a loan for the summer term from private lenders (So far only looked at Sallie Mae). The issue is, I am not taking summer classes. The student loan is approved subject to pending approval from my school. I am worried that the school will not approve the loan because it is not covering school tuition, rather, it is covering living expenses. Additionally, am I exposed to some sort of liability for taking a school loan and not using it for the summer term? I don't want to commit fraud or something in doing so.

We do file taxes jointly and get our tax refund taken as well.  My question is, is it worth getting out of default?  Would love to get the tax refund next year (at this rate would be paid off in 1-2 years)

If we don’t get out of default, will that eventually go away on her record?  It’s currently not on credit reports but the loans left are definitely in default.

t3_g7wnks,StudentLoans,How do I stop my tax refund from being seized for defaulting on my student loans?,"I defaulted on my federal student loan about 5 years ago over a dispute of how much I owed. Currently, my state and federal tax refunds are being redirected to pay my loan off. I was fine with it at first because my refunds weren't that much. Now I am making a lot more money and would rather pay a monthly to the loan rather than lose my tax refunds. Plus I think this would be the time to renegotiate.

My question is if I start paying off my student loan, will they stop taking my refund? If so, how do I go about doing that?

I'm looking for people who've been through this or know what I am talking about and not people who ""guess"" how to do this.

EDIT: I can't help but to see the irony in that some people are asking how can someone with a degree not understand how tax refunds work, but they lacked reading skills. My debt came from grad school. Stuff happened that affected my finances and paying off a student loan was not a priority especially when they had the wrong amount. That was five years ago.

I am making more money now and would rather pay a small monthly amount, write off the tax interest and keep my tax refunds which are going to be sizable. This has nothing to do with tax refund common sense. This has to do with managing the bureaucracy. Finally, I have never met someone who mocked others for not knowing how to do something that actually knew how to do it themselves.","How do I stop my tax refund from being seized for defaulting on my student loans?I defaulted on my federal student loan about 5 years ago over a dispute of how much I owed. Currently, my state and federal tax refunds are being redirected to pay my loan off. I was fine with it at first because my refunds weren't that much. Now I am making a lot more money and would rather pay a monthly to the loan rather than lose my tax refunds. Plus I think this would be the time to renegotiate.

My question is if I start paying off my student loan, will they stop taking my refund? If so, how do I go about doing that?

I'm looking for people who've been through this or know what I am talking about and not people who ""guess"" how to do this.

EDIT: I can't help but to see the irony in that some people are asking how can someone with a degree not understand how tax refunds work, but they lacked reading skills. My debt came from grad school. Stuff happened that affected my finances and paying off a student loan was not a priority especially when they had the wrong amount. That was five years ago.

I am making more money now and would rather pay a small monthly amount, write off the tax interest and keep my tax refunds which are going to be sizable. This has nothing to do with tax refund common sense. This has to do with managing the bureaucracy.

t3_g844sq,StudentLoans,When should I apply for private loans?,"Howdy, everyone! The title really says it all.

t3_g7zyxv,StudentLoans,Wages Being Garnished - Best Way to get out of Default?,"Hello, 

Obligatory notice that I'm a dumbass for not dealing with this earlier. 

With collection fees, I have a 5-6K federal student loan in default with Coast Professionals. I got a notice in the mail in February about wage garnishment. I spoke to someone previously about the loan rehabilitation process, but there was a section I wasn't sure how to fill out. I tried to get in contact with Coast Professional several times for help filling out the form, but this is when the Coronavirus hit. I couldn't get through when I called. Sometimes I went straight through to voicemail which prompted me to leave my contact information, saying someone would get back with me, but they never did. 

I started making monthly payments of around $250 or so through the [myeddebt.ed.gov](https://myeddebt.ed.gov) website a few months ago. I just filed 2018 and 2019 taxes a few weeks ago, and I noticed that my wages were being garnished in the [mydebt.ed.gov](https://mydebt.ed.gov) website ($700-800/month!). There were garnishments listed for February, March, and April, but no money had been taken out of my paycheck, according to my bank account. 

I  know my options are consolidation, rehabilitation, or payment in full. I only have one loan so I don't know if consolidation makes sense, and I think I can pay the loan off faster than the 9-10 months that it would take to rehab. Plus, when I called Coast Professional before, they were pretty dodgy about the rehabilitation process. We could probably afford to pay in full but I'm nervous to have less of an emergency fund in case my wife gets furloughed due to the Coronavirus.

Is there any way to stop the wage garnishment? I plan on calling them ASAP, but I'm not sure what my best option is. I'm eager to set up a plan. Thanks for your help; I know it's not a large loan, but I'm still really freaked out.","Wages Being Garnished - Best Way to get out of Default?Hello,

t3_g7pmt0,StudentLoans,Is the degree really worth it? Need some advice,"Hey everyone, would really appreciate your help and advice!

I just recently got accepted into UC Berkeley and UCLA as a transfer student!! My major at UC Berkeley is Society &amp; Environment and it's Geography/Environmental Studies at UCLA.

Here's the thing though, I applied honestly thinking I wouldn't get in and never thought this far ahead. I missed the deadline for Cal Grant because I forgot I even applied and I was planning on taking a gap year since I already finished all my general ed classes. 

I applied for these majors because I'm passionate about sustainability and the environment; I don't know why but it just felt right to pursue it as a major. But I don't know what careers I would even be able to get with these degrees. I don't know if I want to take out $70,000 in loans for a bachelors, esp since I'm not even sure what career I want to pursue. 

I've been at a community college for two years so I didn't have to deal with any loans, and I was in a program that covered the cost of my classes. I know nothing about loans to be quite honest. The net costs for a year is $35,140 and I'll be attending for two years. My EFC is ~8700 if that matters. My parents claim me as a dependent but they're not contributing to my education and I fully support myself, although currently I have no income because y'know, pandemic. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it extremely hard to declare myself as an independent? (I'm 20).

Is it really worth it to take out that much in loans for an undergraduate degree I'm unsure about? Please lend me some wisdom, I feel so defeated right now. I want to go to these schools, it's an amazing opportunity I've been handed that I know I'll regret if I don't go, but what if I go and regret it?","Is the degree really worth it?

t3_g7bc71,StudentLoans,"Is now the perfect time to ramp up 401k contributions, no 10% penalty, income based loans - lower agi, delayed taxes","So I heard due to Coronavirus the fed has removed the 10% penalty on removing funds.  I'm currently on an income based student loan plan REPAYE.

I didn't plan to contribute much to my 401k this year since I'm poor but now I'm thinking I can lower my student loan monthly payments and get a 3 year deferment on my taxes.  Would this plan work?

Contribute paycheck company max to 401k plan 75%.

Cap 401k limits 19k I believe over the next few months.

Withdraw contributed funds once 401k annual max is hit with no 10% early removal penalty and gain the ability to repay the income tax over the next 3 years.  This is turn reduces my AGI 19k thereby reducing my income based student loans in the future and it lets me pay back the income tax over the next 3 years whereas If I took normal paycheck contributions, it would be due immediately.

This seems like a win from all angles.

1. Lowers my monthly income based student loan payments in the future since I'm going for forgiveness.
2. Gives me a 3 year loan on my income taxes on the monies deposited into my 401k since the tax can be paid back over 3 years.

t3_g7m4y6,StudentLoans,PAYE after residency,"Hi Guys, 

I am a fourth-year medical student going into anesthesiology with 147K school debt. I am trying to choose between PAYE vs REPAYE loan programs. I can't find an answer anywhere to what exactly happens when you no longer qualify for PAYE. I understand that 10% of your original principal interest (14.7K in my case) capitalizes. Does the rest of your interest stay as it is or does it go away? 

Also, apparently, after PAYE, you never pay more than what you would pay under a 10-year standard repayment plan. Is the principal amount used in this case to calculate your monthly payments is the original amount or the new amount after capitalization (14.7K + 147K in my case)? 

My another question is what is the income cut-off for you to no longer qualify for PAYE?

Finally, for someone who wants to refinance loans later, is REPAYE a better option because of the interest forgiven during residency?

Thank you!!!","PAYE after residencyHi Guys,

t3_g7g2xs,StudentLoans,Undergrad Financial Aid,"I am not sure if this is a unique situation, but could not really find anything from a google or Reddit search:

I decided to go back to school this spring and finish my undergrad. I enrolled at a local/online school, and plan to graduate this December. I applied for financial aid and took out a subsidized loan. Now that I am in the swing of things and figured out how to balance school and my FT job, I decided I am going to continue and get my MBA/M.S. (different institution). I have one random UL elective to finish, which led to what I though was a good idea: I am going to take a grad course and have that fill my last elective while already starting to work on my grad degree. Since I am not considered an official grad student yet, I was told not to apply for financial aid through graduate school.

My questions is, for my 20-21 FAFSA, can I take out subsidized/unsubsidized loan and use that to pay for grad courses? I also received two checks for my spring semester, since it was in excess of my course cost (I know some people use these for books, supplies, housing, etc.). I assumed the correct thing to do with the excess is just to pay down the balance...but I wasn't sure if I could use that or additional financial aid to pay for my grad courses. From what I researched, the have a different interest rate. So I wouldn't want to be dishonest about that. 

Any feedback would be great. I would rather not have to pay out of pocket for my first two courses, as the grad school cost per credit is much greater then what I am paying for undergrad.","Undergrad Financial AidI am not sure if this is a unique situation, but could not really find anything from a google or Reddit search:

t3_g6y9hg,StudentLoans,What loan repayment plan would you pick?,"Hi, I'm a graduating medical student faced with the decision of what loan repayment plan to pick (REPAYE, PAYE, IBR) and I'm pretty lost.

I have 169,000 of debt (all direct stafford loans at 5.3-6.6% interest rates) with about 10,000 in interest so far. My interest will capitalize in September when I pick my repayment plan, but I shouldn't collect more until then because of the CARES act w/ covid.

I'm looking at a 3 year residency making 66-68,000 a year. Then I'll go to fellowship for 3 more years and make about the same amount. I expect I'll move into an academic hospitalist position after fellowship (so six years from now) and make around 150,000.

Here is where I get confused. I'm looking at getting married in 3 years. My partner would likely be making 120,000 at that time and he has no debt. He doesn't feel responsible for my medical school debt and isn't sure he wants to contribute to my loan payoff. Fine, and honestly fair, it is my debt. The problem is his income will be included in my REPAYE AGI calculation and in my PAYE if we don't file taxes separately. I don't know how to predict how filing separately would impact our taxes and if that would make the difference with PAYE even worth it. I'm considering PSLF, which would make REPAYE with the payment cap important given our income differential, but I'm not sure it will even be around when it comes time for me. Making those low payments would massively balloon my debt if I went that route and was wrong.

I'm lost and don't know what to do. Anyone have any thoughts/advice?","What loan repayment plan would you pick?Hi, I'm a graduating medical student faced with the decision of what loan repayment plan to pick (REPAYE, PAYE, IBR) and I'm pretty lost.

Sallie Mae could only assist by offering an ""Interest Only"" payment program, which is only good for 12months. If I need further assistance, call back and they will try something else to help.

I was told by someone to refinance my loans for lower interest and low payment. I checked with Creditable and SoFi. I was only able to get a rate with Credible. SoFi advises I have ""excessive financial responsibility vs income"" and that I need a Co-Signer. I never needed a Co-Signer for anything and I know for a fact my credit is good.

I have not refinanced before and I don't know where to start if should.

t3_g70b2w,StudentLoans,Loan Servicing Cost - Stafford to Direct Consolidation Considerations,"So I'm not sure if anyone can answer this but I am wondering what it costs a company to service a loan. Does it depend on the balance/monthly payment or is there a ""floor"" or fixed cost that it will never be lower than to generate statements and what not.   


I am wondering because When I first graduated in 2007 I had about seven Stafford FEEL loans totaling about $20,000. I threw any extra money I had at my student loans and often ended up sacrificing something to do so. I told the servicing company to put the extra at principal and NOT to pay ahead, BUT they payed it ahead anyway. I didn't find this out until years later when it showed almost a full year of payed ahead status. Shortly after finding this out they sold my loan to Great Lakes so there wasn't much to do about it. Well the years went by with Great Lakes until they themselves resold my loan back to my original servicer.  


I am now considering consolidating six of the remaining Stafford loans to a Consolidated Direct loan. I owe about $7,000 and the APR's on the loans are 6.8, 6.55, 4.66, 4.66, 4.66 and 4.66. One of the 4.66% loans only has a balance of $229 left. Basically I am wondering the cost to the company to service that $229 with a $3 monthly payment for the full remaining eight years. By leaving this loan out of my consolidation I will be paying a higher interest rate since Direct consolidation loans get their interest rate by averaging the rates of all the loans. so my new APR will suffer slightly with one less 4.66% loan to add in.  If I calculated correctly it would mean a rate of 5.46 instead of 5.33 so this slightly higher rate will cost me about $10 a year extra just to keep the tiny loan out of the consolidation.   


As I understand it servicers only get about half of a percent of the monthly payment they process so they would get about 15 cents a month in revenue off my loan. If the cost to service a loan has a fixed ""floor"" and that cost is say $4 or $5 I would say it might be worth spending $10 a year to make me feel better about them stealing all that money in extra interest from me back in 2007/2008 by paying ahead and not extra towards the principal, but if that cost to them is only a $1 a month it prob isn't worth the cost. Anyone know how to find out? Thanks for any help you can provide.","Loan Servicing Cost - Stafford to Direct Consolidation ConsiderationsSo I'm not sure if anyone can answer this but I am wondering what it costs a company to service a loan.

t3_g6z8nq,StudentLoans,Entrance Loan Counseling,"Hey all,

I am planning to start my Masters in the Summer semester here in a few weeks but needed to complete an MPN and Entrance Loan Counseling. I signed the MPN and completed the Entrance Loan Counseling but the way I was understanding the ELC form was to be on a purely informative basis and not something treated as an official form to base any loans or repayment off of. I left some numbers like estimated housing costs provided by the school unchanged so when I got to the end and submitted it popped up with a summary page where it stated something along the lines that the information I provided will be reported to my loan servicer. I wanted to ask if I need to complete another form and ensure every number is accurate as it also had me estimate what I expect to make after I finish my degree and the typical salary is $60k in the ideal job that I am aiming for so I put that but it also started basing repayment numbers off of that and I've had at most a $30k salary in the past. 

Questions: Should I resubmit another one? Call my school to explain numbers since the form is being sent to them? Is the form purely an informative one for the one completing?","Entrance Loan CounselingHey all,

t3_g6e05a,StudentLoans,"$92,500 in loans, still have 1 more year of college need advice","Hey everybody, I'm in need of advice

I currently have $92,500 in loans, and I don't know how to pay for my last year of college.

I also have a plan for what to do after graduating, and wanted to hear opinions on it

I'm currently finishing up my junior year of college, and I don't know how I want to pay for my senior year.  I, like many other kids, stupidly took out expensive loans so I could go to an out-of-state college, and even though I am getting a good degree (Mechanical Engineering), I still regret the amount of debt I have put myself into just for an education.  I wish I had spent my first 1.5 - 2 years at commumity college so I could save a lot of money, but it's too late for that now.  It only recently just hit me just how much debt I'm in, and I'm really sad and scared about it and what to do. 

Here are my current loans:

Private loans: (Only paying interest while still in school)

$35,000 5.19% 15 year

$38,000 5.6 % 15 year

Federal sub/undsub loans: 

$19,500 \~4.5%

My last year of college will be \~$35,000, minus the federal loans ($7,500) I accept  for the 2020-2021 school year, so that means I still have to come up with around $27,500 for my senior year.  Should I take out another loan? I can't take a year off school to work and save money to pay for my senior year because I will have to start making full payments on my existing loans and won't be able to save enough.  I really don't want to go over 100k in student loan debt, but it looks like that is the only option to be able to graduate.

My father has told me not to be scared about this, and he says when I graduate I can still live home rent free, and he will help pay a little bit each month.  I know for mechanical engineers the starting salarying ranges from 60-65k a year, and since I am close to NYC I know that starting salaries are closer to \~70k.  My first engineering intership I had was in NYC, so I am used to the travel there for work.  Since my only debt is my loans, my father told me I can make double and triple payments on my private loans the first \~2-3 years, and that will lower them a substatial amount, especially if I get a good entry level job.  At the moment, I'm not very worried about paying off my federal loans faster than my private loans, because the interest rates are lower.  With my private loans, I have calculated that if I make double payments on my private loans they will be paid in about 5.5 years opposed to 15 years, and I will save &gt;$22,000 in interest. If I make a little more money I could pay even more than double payments too and pay them off even faster. 

To Summarize:

\-I still need to pay for my last year of college and I really don't want to go further into debt, so I am hesitant about getting another loan, but it looks like its the only choice.  (Go from 92.5k total in loans right now to \~128k total after graduating)

\-To deal with my loans, my plan is after I graduate I hope to find a good job in NYC while living with my parents. They said they wouldn't charge me anything for rent or food, and I will be able to put most of my salary into my private loans through double or more payments since I have no other debt, and I will likely just pay the minimum on my federal loans unless I can pay more since they are low interest.","$92,500 in loans, still have 1 more year of college need adviceHey everybody, I'm in need of advice

t3_g6em0c,StudentLoans,Graduating Senior...advice please!,"I’m a graduating senior and have to make a decision for which university or college I will be attending in less than a week. Here’s my scenario: I got into Vassar, and I’ve fallen in love. I’ve made some connections with other admits, and I know that the alumni network is amazing. It’s relatively easy to get internships in the city. There is an open curriculum and I am thinking pre-law, but I’m not sure, and I know this would benefit me immensely. It is all undergrad, meaning tons of opportunity for research and exploration, and even a 300 acre preserve and farm on campus for research opportunity. That said, costs are around 75,000 and I would have to pay about 63,000 per year, which includes a small subsidized loan of 3000. My family has said they would help me pay about 40,000 per year, but they would have to take out loans to do it. I feel like they would be able to pay about 2 years, but struggle with the other two. They’re not 100% open. The rest is on me. That’s about 92,000 in total for me if my financial appeal doesn’t come through. I don’t want to be a burden, but this is an amazing opportunity. I’ve also had an absolutely horrible experience in high school because my peers are mostly unmotivated and lazy, and I want to be in an institution that fosters creativity with people who love learning. I CANNOT settle for a school because high school was bad enough. 

That being said, I got a full ride to St Johns University, but I really hate that school because of the sheer amount of requirements in the curriculum. I’ll never explore anything. I would be paying 5000 for SUNY Stony Brook, it’s fine but huge and not ideal. I also got 32,500 in scholarship for Fordham, but Fordham is 72,000 anyway. The location for Fordham is a draw, as is the alumni network. But I would still have to take out loans and at that point, is it worth it if I choose Vassar instead? Also I’m in the honors program for Stony and St Johns.

I’m planning to get a job out of college to help me fund grad school. I’m thinking of law but am not certain. I want to be in the best position possible to be successful, and I know Vassar’s alumni and name can help. I’m just so stressed about the finances, and my family has expressed that they cannot pay unless I take out the loans in my name. I’m also trying to apply to scholarships, so I may get some money.

t3_g6bewu,StudentLoans,grad school - unsubsidized student loan vs personal loan,"I got into some of the best schools for what I plan to study, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity. 

Unfortunately, for my top choices, I could not find a single company that would offer student loan. The schools are in scandinavia, and for whatever reason, no one, including Salle Mae, would provide loan. The only option is personal loan for those schools. 

I also got accepted at McGill, and luckily, I can apply for the US federal unsubsidized student loan.

&amp;#x200B;

If I understand correctly, the major difference between unsubsidized student loan versus a personal loan is simply ""start pay now"" vs ""start pay once you are done with school"". Either way, it will still pile up  interest over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, it's better to start paying as soon as I can to reduce the amount of interest. On the other hand, it will be very difficult to pay monthly payment while being a full time student. I plan on getting a decent part time job, but I don;t know how successful I'll be with that in a foreign country.

t3_g63kbj,StudentLoans,Variable Interest Rate Riskiness?,"I'm currently a student earning my Master's in Reading Education. I have four courses remaining, and due to the pandemic, I wanted to finish them up during the summer. However, I just realized today that I can't apply my 2020-2021 student loan offer to this summer. I currently have $30k in student loans from undergrad and grad school.

If I finish in the summer, I'll be able to earn my Master's pay this current school year ($74,616 from $67,813). If I finish in the fall, my new pay will be applied in the 2021-2022 school year. If I wait until the fall semester, I can get the federal loan interest rate in September. It'll just be more difficult while teaching than it will be during the summer. The summer courses are also shorter. 

The total cost is $9080. At the end of this school year, I am getting $1125 reimbursed from my school district, bringing the cost down to $7,995.

Because I have no financial aid options for the summer, I was looking at private loans. Sally Mae has an offer for a fixed rate loan for 5.750% with interest payments in the beginning and principle payments later. It's fixed rate option is 8.1250%.

I know that variable interest rates are often risky. How risky are they right now? I figure I'm also going to refinance all my loans once I'm all done. So is it that risky? Any other advice for means of acquiring the funds?

*Edit: I called the office of financial aid again and asked about increasing my borrowing limit as per u/horsebycommittee's advice. She directed me to a Summer Aid form from which the balance of the original amount offered to me would become available. Looks like the problem is solved as long as they approve it.

t3_g65jtn,StudentLoans,Targeted Payments - Covid Deferral Period,"  

Since we are currently not obligated to make payments on our student loans, I recently attempted to make targeted payments only to the student loan with the highest interest rate. Cornerstone is my provider and during my first attempt I went through their online portal and entered my bank information. After a week or so, I noticed they never withdrew the money from my account. I followed up with them and they stated the bank information was inaccurate. This was the same bank information they have been automatically deducting payments from for years. During this call, I ask the Customer Service Rep to initiate they payments on their end. They requested my bank information and I relayed this information from a physical check that was right in front of me. The initial payment said processed and when I looked at my bank it was never withdrawn. Ultimately the funds were never withdrawn and I was unable to make the payment to the specific higher interest loan. 

I called them today to confirm why it didn't go through and they said the bank did not have any information with my account information. I immediately called my bank and they (1) confirmed the information I provided to Cornerstone was accurate and (2) that they never attempted to deduct the funds from account.

Has anyone had this issue? I want to use this time as an opportunity to pay down the higher interest loan but I can't help but think something shady is going on.","Targeted Payments - Covid Deferral Period

t3_g63yzq,StudentLoans,I need some advice on a plan to pay off these student loans.,"I have $68,880 in student loans half are private loans and half are federal. When I graduated from college back in 2008 my loans totaled to $120,000. Due to recession in 08 I had a hard time finding a job in my field and had to defer loans for a year. Over the years I struggled to make the payments I contacted Sallie Mae and they screwed me. I didnt realize at the time but they extended my loan to 25 years with a variable interest rate. So now I have been paying around $1200 a month for the longest time and it seems like I am barely making a dent. Considering I have been out of school for so long. My goal is to start paying this debt off as soon as possible.

Here is where I need your help. My loans are all through Navient. What is the best way to pay off these loans. I have multiple loans with different interests rates. I was considering refinancing, but was worried that would disqualify me from any future loan forgiveness. Also my college was sued for defraudulent practices so I do have a claim for forgiveness that is not being processed by the current administration. So I am not sure refinancing is the right move right now, but some of my loans are rocking a 8% interest rate. I have made a few larger payments recently to navient and I am confused on how they are allocating my payments. Sometimes it seems they are going to unpaid interest, sometime interest, sometimes principal amount. I attempted to pay off all the unpaid interest so I made over payments for the unpaid totals but checked today and those payments didnt all go to the interest so I am at a loss for what is going on. Please reddit community can you give me some advice to help come up with a strategy to pay these off. Thank you in advance.

t3_g5kicr,StudentLoans,"About to start a DPT program with quite a bit of loan, any advice would be appreciated!","Hello everyone! Hope everyone is staying safe in this time.

I’m about to start a DPT program (3years including summer) in fall 2020 with a good amount of debt and I was wondering if anyone have any advice on how to have a right mindset or how to start preparing to pay for them.

Thankfully I can cover the full tuition and cost of living with just federal loans (unsubsidized and grad plus loans). I’m estimating to have 176K before the interst for this 3 years program.

Unfortunately, I did not get accepted into in-state program (the one I’m going is also in-state but private).

Every year I’m going to look for work-study program that’s provided by the college or any scholarships available.

I know the debt will be high once I graduate and I’m definitely going to try to work for a non-profit hospital (for PSLF) or become a traveling PT (pays higher)to pay the loan as fast as possible. But every time I look at how much I will be in debt once I graduate is pretty scary and depressing.

t3_g5ky60,StudentLoans,Pre-planning for student loans. I really need help before signing away my soul.,"I'll be going to law school next year. I already work in law, so I know what I'm getting myself into as a career. I know it most likely won't make a lot of money, but it's something I actually enjoy and would like to make a career out of. It's where my passion lies...unfortunately, because if my passion was within engineering, money would be far less of a fear.  
That said, student loans. No matter what school I go to, I'll need to take some out if only to cover the living expenses. I've calculated around 80k for 3 years at a school where I have full tuition if I can't get any work during those 3 years, but employment rate upon graduation at that school is quite low. I have a few choices for schools, but I'm trying to figure out the feasibility of survival after taking out the loans.  
I've been trying to run the numbers, but I have no experience in budgeting or finance.  
I've run the numbers through some separate calculators, but I know the numbers can't be correct. Otherwise, everyone would be taking out loans as no big deal.  
Here's what I'm getting: If I take out $180,000 in loans over 3 years, then graduate with a job paying $60,000 (about the median amount attorneys make if you get rid of the outliers), then using [MIT's living wage calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06037) for Los Angeles, the cost of living would be 26,528, income tax based on [smartasset's calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) would be around 16000, and monthly loan payments based on [studentaid.gov's calculator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator) would be from 344-483/month if my income grows by 2% annually. This would, if assuming the $483 payment as a constant, theoretically leave me with around 11000/year left over to pocket. If 10% of wages should go into retirement savings, that still leaves 5k/year. It's been pointed out to me in /r/personalfinance that mit's living wage calculator is likely a gross underestimation of living expenses. According to the [census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/losangelescountycalifornia) website, the median income for LA is around 64k/year, though 14.2% of people live in poverty.  
All of my loans will be federal loans because I'm ""lucky"" enough to be broke enough to qualify for entirely federal to cover all expenses. But the 60k/year income is more of a median estimate, so there's a chance that I'd either make significantly less, or even be unable to find employment, or significantly more, around 180k/year (around 40% of graduates from that school made 180k/year in the first year's salary).  
A lot of this planning hinges on loan forgiveness after 20 years if I can't get a high paying job after graduation. Financial aid offices tout this as a viable option, but how viable is it really?  
No matter where I go, I'll end up with somewhere between 80k-180k in student loans, and the more loans I take out, the higher the probability of getting the job that will allow me to pay off those loans...but there's still a chance that no matter where I go, I won't get a job anywhere, and I'll still end up owing a lot of money. That's the double edge sword. A piece of me thinks ""80k debt with no job...well, what's the difference between 80k debt with no job and 180k debt with no job, that debt will still be impossible to pay off either way.""  
Financial aid offices at schools are very biased, as are the government websites that give you the loans in the first place, so I'd like as much information as possible about pre-budgeting, paying off student loans in the future, etc.  
I'm also aware of PSLF, and would like to keep that open as an option, but I know I can't depend on it because it could be taken away at any point.","Pre-planning for student loans.

t3_g54dln,StudentLoans,Federal Student Loans Repayment Schedule/Redisclosure Questions (general &amp; COVID Qs),"**Summary:**

1. Did my servicer calculate my repayment schedule wrong? Is it too late to do anything after 6 years? 
2. Will servicers redisclose the loans (recalibrate payment schedules) after COVID forbearance?
3. If I'm paid ahead slightly, and my loans are redisclosed, will my monthly payment go up or down? 

**Background**  
I finished grad school in 2014 with $16K in undergraduate debt and $121K in grad school debt (total $137K). This was a breakdown of my loans (including the uncapitalized accumulated interest):

|FFEL (3 loans cumulative)|$16,000 |
|:-|:-|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$15,023|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$14,200|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$22,600|
|Direct PLUS|$6,000|
|Direct PLUS|$11,200|
|Direct PLUS|$34,764|

I did not consolidate the loans. Extended Graduated Repayment worked best for my situation and I was given a 20 year repayment schedule (240 months). I know the FFEL loans were only eligible for 10 yr repayment.

After 17 payments, my servicer redisclosed my repayment schedule, and the repayment schedule was 240 months again.

I was recently reading that a borrower can have up to 25 years (300 months) for repayment under Extended Repayment. Was my $121K in Direct loans only enough for a 20 year repayment schedule? Is it too late to do anything at this point?

Through lots of hard work, I have knocked down my debt to about $80K.  Also, I am paid ahead by a 3-5 months on my remaining loans.  Does anyone know if after COVID forbearance, will the servicers be redisclosing the repayment schedule? If I'm paid ahead, will the payment go down slightly?","Federal Student Loans Repayment Schedule/Redisclosure Questions (general &amp; COVID Qs)**Summary:**

t3_g56ijb,StudentLoans,18 and need loan advice,"Hello!

I was recently admitted to my dream school, UC Santa Barbara, but I am not in good standing relationship with either of my parents and they are infuriated with my decision to go to a univeristy (they want me to work just like them, and not actually attend college), as well as the idea of taking out a loan to attend, despite the fact that I have gotten straight A's throughout high school. I am very scared that I wont be able to attend due to the fact that my parents will not cosign any sort of private loan that I would need in order to attend. I am currently very behind on many things, as I turned 18 a few months ago and do not even having a checking or credit account with the bank. Currently, I would need to take out $27,000 in loans for one year at this school, but I do not know how to do this without my parent's help, and they refuse to offer any advice or support which is why I have come here for help. My parents make above $80,000 combined so colleges wouldn't be lenient to reducing the tuition for me either. I really want to know what my options are and I hope someone here could help me figure things out. Of course I know I need to go to the bank ASAP and open a credit card up, but is it possible for me to easily take out $27,000 in loans without my parents to cosign? Any advice is greatly appreicated!

TL;DR -- Unsure how to take out $27,000 in student loans as an 18-year old with no parental help, despite the fact that I am still dependent on them. Google confused me on my options so I wondered if anyone here has a clue on what I could do in this situation. FAFSA said I qualified for about 5000 in federal loans.

EDIT: The school says I need to find 19k from private lenders and that I qualify for 8k from college/federal lenders. I can most likely live off campus to reduce this number by a few thousand, probably 3 or 4 thousand. I really am looking for a college experience and memories -- but am unsure if its worth the money. It is my dream school after all!

Thank you!","18 and need loan adviceHello!

t3_g54jlc,StudentLoans,Looking for student loan options,"Parent here. Looking for options to borrow \~ 30K per year to pay for child's undergraduate education.

Notes: 

* Cost of attendance would be close to 60K/year, **AFTER** factoring in financial aid. Unfortunately, the school is not providing a lot of assistance (a small ""scholarship"" and maxed-out federal student loans and work-study)
* We can probably afford 25-30K per year out-of-pocket. Looking at ways to finance the remainder

Looking at alternatives to PLUS loans. Any advice on seeking out private student loans? What to avoid?

Sallie Mae sounds like a fairly standard option, but I'm not sure if there are better options.

The loan would be in the child's name, with the parent's as cosigners. We have Very Good to Excellent credit, but the child (just turned 18) has no credit history. We intend to assist with paying off the loan, but the child would be responsible for taking over loan payments after graduation.

t3_g4w47y,StudentLoans,My bf had no idea he had any loans...thought his parents paid up front...6 loans in default for 3 +years..help,"So obviously my bf made some mistakes in his past. His parents also made several mistakes. Yes, we know this is bad but we need help.   


So, he has 6 student loans from what I can tell that all totaled around 10k ..all six went into default approximately 3  years ago. His parents never told him he had loans..much less that they were going to stop paying them ..so we have sifted through his credit report.    



From what I can tell all six were from department of Ed..in 2018 they were sold back to the federal government? They have all accrued interest and collections charges that bring the grand total now to over $15,000.    


After my research I have done I have decided he should call and ask about rehabilitation ...but I have questions... 


What if he isn’t eligible and the 7yr mark resets on all because he contacted them? Will he immediately have to pay all 15k?   



If he does loan rehab will the interest and collections fees have the option to be waived? He didn’t even get his degree and it is so heartbreaking to pay 5,000 in interest when he is already paying 10k for absolutely nothing.   


If he is able to do rehab will it bring all loans out of default after the ten months of payments?    


His credit is 490 or so...I know it’s going to continue dropping...does this mean that he will always have bad credit?   



My head is spinning. I have student loans too but I got my bachelors and only have 5k in debt that I have been paying on since graduation .   


I am so worried that he is forever screwed. I know it’s not all on his parents but truthfully I completely believe him that his parents never told him anything. He suffered a brain injury as a child and therefore his parents neglect to tell him things about the real world sometimes due to either thinking he’s too stupid to understand or thinking he shouldn’t have to worry about this stuff since they paid for their other children to go to school. I can see on the credit report that his mother paid payments on 3 of the 6 loans for about 2 years before suddenly defaulting on all of them.

t3_g500mb,StudentLoans,Alternatives to Parent PLUS Loans?,"I'm currently a freshman in college. Because I was a kid (and frankly, I still am), my mother insisted she'd cosign on a Parent PLUS loan with me because she didn't think I could find any lender.

t3_g4w6kl,StudentLoans,Need advice for next steps,"25 years old, 4th year out of college and finally in a good place financially to really get the ball rolling on my student loans (\~33k).  I've only been making the minimum payments using an IDR which hasn't done much in bringing down principal/interest. Currently in a REPAYE plan. Over the last year and half, my main focus was creating an emergency fund. Since I was only making minimum payments, I didn't put my extra funds towards student loans. Honestly, my financial situation my first 2 years out of college was very hard (IDR min payment $0 to student loans during then) and psychologically I just needed to see my checking account balance go up which I know probably didn't do me any favors for repayment. Hoping to fix all of that. 

I have 2 loan servicers, one through my university and other though Great Lakes.  The loan through my school isn't in forbearance from COVID but everything else is. I listed out my loans below:

School: 

* $4,400 (5%)

Federal:

* Sub $4,600 (3.86%)
* Unsub $2,400 (3.86%)
* Sub $3,600 (3.40%)
* Unsub $2,900 (6.8%)

I have the ability to payoff up to 6/7k but not sure where to put that first. Should I just pay off my $4,400 school loan since the interest isn't at 0% right now? Or should I pay off the unsub $2,900 (6.8%)? I also have just under $600 in unpaid interest, so should that be the first thing I pay off? If I put anything towards the federal loans, should I just hold off until September when everything restarts? I've been reading about the snowball or avalanche methods, but I still get very lost in what would best work for me. AGI is about 46k/year. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

t3_g4qj2d,StudentLoans,I think an acquaintance of mine just got scammed,"I was casually having a conversation with an acquaintance of mine and we got into the topic of student loans. I was telling him my repayment strategy when he said he got his wiped. He went on telling me about how ""there's a loophole"" and that an old classmate of his that ""works for the government"" helps people with this kind of stuff as a side hustle. 

He said he charged him $2000 with a promise that he can wipe out his SLs from all 3 of the major credit bureaus by claiming that they are fraudulent. He went on to explain that since these private servicing companies like Navient, Sallie Mae, FedLoans, ""bought"" your loans from the government...that you're not entitled to pay them at all. His logic is that the promissory note you signed when you signed with FAFSA doesn't obligate you to pay these private parties because they would'nt be able to produce that promissory note if any of the bureuas decided to do an audit. He said his friend has a 6 month guarantee or your money back so he's not worried. He started the process back in February and he said he started seeing accounts being labeled as ""closed"" on his FedLoan account as early as March as well as those accounts being labeled as closed on his Experian account. He even showed me screenshots of it which I'm wary of.

He sent me his friend's info and I checked it out. It's a consulting agency website full of screenshots of happy customers and their credit karma/Experian dashboards with improving credit scores. He doesnt just do this with SLs. He also provides services related to credit card debt, mortgage debt, and more. I checked out his Instagram and it was only created back in November 2019.

I was obviously suspicious so I dug up my old promissory notes and looked for where it mentions anything about paying through a servicer....and it's everywhere. I also checked out Studentaid.gov and found a section saying:

""In some cases, we need to transfer loans from one servicer to another servicer. **If we transfer your federal student loans from one servicer to another servicer, your loans will still be owned by ED.

Sorry if I sound ignorant or naive but I’m not financially literate and instead of helping me my parents are just belittling me. I just need 10k for college this year, so I’ve been looking into Navy Federal Private Student Loans.

t3_g4qaji,StudentLoans,Repayment and refinancing: What's the best option for repaying private loans ($20k and $6.8k)?,"I've posted on here before, and I have somewhat good news! My student loan debt got cut because my uni accepted my income appeal! I have about $43k in student loan debt now and $13k of that is in a savings fund. I want to save a bit of it as an emergency fund in case I lose my current bad paying job (my manager said it's very on the rocks due to shutdowns; I would only make about $30k a year and even that isn't locked in). I am trying to find a better paying job before just getting two jobs, but a lot of the positions I've applied for have been canceled because of the pandemic. What would be the best way to cut my debt and pay it off fast?

&amp;#x200B;

I have read a lot about refinancing, so I'm thinking of paying off a big chunk of the $13k toward my biggest private student loan ($20k), but the thing is that I don't know whether to do that or just pay off the $6.8k private loan completely first. The rest of my debt is in federal student loans, so I'm not too concerned with it.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, can you refinance one private student loan? The $6.8k one has 11.5% interest and the $20k one has 10.8% interest (thanks discover), so I'm not sure what the best option is here. I have an above-average credit score so I want to try to refinance right when I graduate. I've researched it, but it seems most companies are interested in consolidating multiple loans.

t3_g4uloh,StudentLoans,Student loan forgiveness (CARES),"Hey everyone!
Was just writing in to try and confirm some here-say I had been hearing from colleagues and friends of the family. Apparently a few single moms with children have had their federal student loans forgiven? I’m curious if this is true as it has all been rumors at this point and I’m wondering if anyone has any concrete data on this. It makes you wonder if more help is on the horizon for loan forgiveness due to these unprecedented times.","Student loan forgiveness (CARES)Hey everyone!

t3_g4uf70,StudentLoans,403b changes in the CARES act,"Hey all 

Was looking for some advice on a couple of scenarios. Me and my wife hold about 60k in private student loans. We also Federal loans and we are both on the PSLF track. 

Given that our loans have varying interest rates I was going to try and consolidate our loans to the lowest fixed rate I could find (for reference all of our loans have about 13 years left in the term). I just received an email from my job detailing some of the changes in the cares act. 

From what I understand I could withdraw up to 100k and the pre withdrawal penalty would be waived bit I would still need to pay income taxes. I also could spread those taxes over 3 years. 

For some background me and my wife’s jobs are pretty secure and are very unlikely to be affected. So here are my options (assuming I qualified)

Option 1 : consolidate my loans and my wife’s loans into two separate loans (one for each of us) with the lowest fixed rate I can get at the same or similar payment term. Will continue to pay the same monthly amount as I am currently so any savings would lead to a sooner payoff

Option 2 : withdraw the money needed to payoff the loans in full. Likely spread the income tax payments over 3 years. My primary retirement account currently sits at about 130k and this will be a big hit. Will take the money saved from paying off and focus on maxing out both of our 403b plans to recoup losses

Option 3: consolidate now while interest rates are low. Wait to see if the market improves before the end of the year (these rules are in effect until Dec 2020). With an improved market my plan will likely have recouped some losses and I could withdraw then. 

Thanks in advance for the advice","403b changes in the CARES actHey all

t3_g4y86k,StudentLoans,Student Loan Forbearance May Impact Credit Reporting?,"I contacted Great Lakes to ask about how forbearance impacts credit reporting. I heard that other types of loans, such as mortgages, when placed in forbearance will be reported as such on a credit report; lenders may look at forbearance negatively, even if there is no delinquency or missed payment reported. I asked if that would also happen with student loan forbearance and if participating in forbearance could impact my credit and/or ability to qualify for a mortgage in the future.

Great Lakes responded:

""Each credit bureau has its own unique method and product for determining credit scores. Because their products are proprietary, we are uncertain what exact credit values are used and how they are weighed. We do know that maintaining a sound payment history and successfully managing your account so that late payments don’t occur is a benefit for credit scoring.

Our office reports a number of data pieces on your account, the current status, the loan open date, high credit (total disbursed amount minus refunds), payoff amount, which includes late charges and all accrued interest, and the amount and date of your last payment. We also report the type of loan, and your obligation towards the loan.

For your convenience, we have included a list of the credit bureaus. Their customer service staff may be able to discuss how your student loan impacts your credit score.""

I called Great Lakes and asked to have the forbearance removed from my account and the officer said to ""give it some time."" When I asked how long, they said it would usually take 3-5 business days, but a lot of people are asking to be taken out of forbearance right now so it could take longer. My payments were formerly due on the 23rd, so I asked if I should go ahead and make a payment before then since the process may not be complete by then. The officer said I probably should so that my account wouldn't be past due.

I called TransUnion and they said it would not impact my score, but forbearance would be reported. They said it's up to the lender how they want to interpret forbearance and that ""hopefully"" lenders would be understanding since forbearance was automatic.

I know this is a whole new process for everyone, but it worries me that companies don't seem to have the details worked out. I've paid more than my monthly payment for the life of my student loan and am on track to pay it off years early. I had planned on saving my payments for then next 6 months, then making a large payment in September. That's the advice I've seen here, on other subreddits, and heard from other people. I would hate to have difficulty borrowing money for a house one day because I was automatically placed in forbearance and didn't make payments when I could have. Just wanted to give others a heads up and see if anyone else has heard anything different.","Student Loan Forbearance May Impact Credit Reporting?I contacted Great Lakes to ask about how forbearance impacts credit reporting.

t3_g4y6vg,StudentLoans,Where/how should I allocate the monthly loan payment during COVID for best results?,"I'm not too financially savvy and was wondering what kind of work I'd need to do to figure out what the best option for my school loan payments would be during COVID's repayment period. I'm partaking in the PSLF program, so after 120 payments, they get discharged. I have no faith this program will make it through the next presidential cycle so would like to pay something towards them despite all the payments being on forbearance. I would still like to contribute the amount I'm usually paying per month to my debt and this amount could pay off four smaller loans by the time the forbearance is lifted. I don't know how much interest this would save me over the years, however. Nor do I know if this is the best option for lowering my burden. Would it be better to put this monthly payment to the accumulated interest, the smaller loans to pay them off and get them off the account, or just to a bigger loan? Or something else that I'm failing to see?

t3_g4g4sd,StudentLoans,Student loan monster,"Hey guys. I'm new to the sub and joined looking to see if anyone had insight on how to deal with this monster amount of student loans I've accumulated and/or how you manage the anxiety that comes with it.

I grew up in poverty and really didn't have a clear idea of what was normal or not finance-wise. When I applied to University and got in, my family was over the moon as I'd be the first to attend. We didn't know what we were doing, we just knew that if I went to school I'd make a lot of money someday, and be able to pay off whatever we borrowed. We were very ignorant.

I had to borrow every penny to attend school and worked part time jobs the entire time to afford food and gas money. I had scholarships and grants, but they didn't help much.

I was told that going to a state school wouldn't be as good and that I was guaranteed to make more coming from a private University. I know now that that was a load of shit. 

Now I am $126,000 in debt. I emerged with bachelor's and master's degrees in Speech Language Pathology and have a good job now that I've graduated and gotten out of school. My current job gets me ~46k before taxes with benefits, and working on the school year schedule. My first year of work is considered a fellowship year and has reduced pay. My husband is in the process of gaining his master's and is anticipating a starting 70k/year. He will come out with another ~42k in loans.

We are already far beyond where my family is and how I grew up, but I'm worried about paying off these loans and ending up where I started. Anytime I think about repayment I freak out. I see so many people struggling to pay off loans of 20-40k and that terrifies me because mine is 4x greater.

My base student loan bill will be $1,300/month. We might be able to get it down to ~800/month through income based repayment. I know this is possible, but I just don't know how to approach this.


TLDR: Grew up poor and didn't understand money. Ended up with a Master's degree and 126k in debt.

**Cat tax 1:**  (scroll down to bottom for 2nd cat tax)  https://imgur.com/6Ya4Y6i

&amp;nbsp; 

**Private DEBT:**  **54,000 thousand** -Starting at 10% interest ending in 13% interest 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2011:**  

* Graduated in 2011 from a private-for profit college.   I was working 100 hour weeks between graduation, a full time job, and an internship. 

*  Broke up with alcoholic boyfriend.   Lapsed into a monotonous depression.   Did not pay my student loans at all this year.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2012:** 

* Bought an ipad.   Used lots of forbearance. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2013:** 

* Ran out of money via reduced hours in the winter.   Cried in the bathroom because I didn’t have enough money to replace my uniform that went missing.  Didn’t have enough money for food.   Asked reddit about food banks and someone send me over 100 dollars for food.  (Thank you!)  

* Listened to the book “Total Money Makeover” by Dave Ramsey.   Something clicked, I got hope, never looked back.  Saved up for 1,000 emergency fund.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2014:**  

* Paid off 3,000 worth of credit card debt with my tax refund.  Worked all available overtime. 

* Income 31k to 34k 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2015:**
  
* Car broke down, needed emergency repairs.   
* Changed jobs after getting passed up 3x for a promotion.    Now a supervisor. Worked all available overtime.  34k to 37k

&amp;nbsp; 

**2016:**   

* Chipped and lost tooth.   3k worth of dental bills, 1.5k not covered by insurance.  Chipped another tooth and needed a root canal.   Insurance maxed out.  2.5k worth of dental bills.
* Working a 2nd job part time but had to quit because it was too draining. 
* Sober ex got back into my life and then started drinking again.  Broke into my house. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2017**

* Another junker broke down.  Emergency fund again depleted.   
* Did not get the promotion I wanted.  Contemplated suicide.  I thought about suicide a lot, but this was my only real time I felt like I needed to do it.   The urge was sudden, out of nowhere, and very powerful.  The pull to do it was intense.  I had access to the roof and all I had to do was jump off.    Starting calling the hotline.  Have called it once a year since probably.  They will totally talk to you even if you're not suicidal.   Any crisis where I feel overwhelmed, I will call.  
* Rejected by many loan refinancing companies. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2018:** 

* More emergency car repairs.  
* Got promoted to manager of another department.  The job was incredibly toxic.  I regret taking that job until this day.   Started getting anxiety attacks on the regular.   Income 37k to 39k.  
* Got rejected by many loan refinancing companies.  
* Discovered minimalism by watching “Minimalism” and got rid of and sold 50% of my belongings 
* Sold my entire video game collection, my gaming systems, my manga, my bike, and anything else of significant value for extra money.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2019:**
   
* Switched departments.   Back to a department that was monotonous.  New boss is very unprofessional, hard to talk to, and she gives me terrible hours and little help to do my job.    
* Both of my cats got bitten and severally infected.  I thought I was going to be the first person in my city to die of rabies (we did not have rabies.)  Had a nervous breakdown.     One cat recovered with antibiotics.  Other cat lost a leg.  Accidentally took cat to the most expensive animal hospital, 6,000 bill and amputation.   Added to debt snowball and paid off 6k bill. 
* Got approved by Lendkey.   13% rate down to 6.25 interest rate for remaining 17k loan.   Freaking finally
* Took a pay cut to get out of the hospitality industry and protect my mental health.  40k to 37k.   Started working in the medical field.  New boss is both fake and crazy.   My job was essentially trying to force old and disabled people to use a small ipad against their will.   Got fired for the first time in my life.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2020:**  

* Got rehired in hospitality management in late 2019.  Working crazy overtime.   37k bumped to 48k.    
* Started throwing money at my debt at an unprecedented rate.  
* Missed my final payment due to getting furloughed.
* Just got unemployment and stimulus check.   Hahaha, lets do this.  (Don’t worry, I still have 2k in reserve!) 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Things that helped:**

* Switching jobs when you can’t get promoted
* My emergency fund saved my ass every year with junker car repairs. 
* Eating out only a few times a year and on special occasions 
* Following Dave Ramsey’s plan, starting with the lowest debt and working towards the highest debt.  
* Selling everything, sacrificing everything to win  
* Getting into minimalism and seeing how little I need to own because I don't use the things I have. 
* Making enough money to get approved for refinancing 
* Not dating anyone.   Going out= spending $$$ 
* Libraries!  Coffee shops!  MY FREAKING GOD I LOVE THE LIBRARY 
* Holy s---, between paying off all my care credit dentist bills, credit cards, vet bills, and private student loans, my credit score is f---ing amazing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Things I struggled with**

* Getting started.  My very first “extra” payment was 30 dollars and I remember how awful it felt because the entire thing went to interest and didn’t hit the principle at all.   That was sad.  Getting started when your debt is so high and your interest is so high, it’s feels impossible to make a dent at first. 
* Not seeing my family very often, out of state
* My mental health.  I decided paying off my private debt was worth my life (in the good and bad sense.)
* Every emergency was another gut punch, another setback even if I could pay for it.   
* Income going up slowly instead of quickly.  Feeling like other people are making more money than you while reminding yourself many people make less than you. 
* The never ending monotony.   Staying home day after day after day after day.    It’s like walking in the desert for six years.  You know there’s water in 6 years, but you’re thirsty, and tired, but if you keep walking… every day, every day, for six years…. It will be over.  It will be over, I just need to put my one foot in front of the other.  This is miserable.  But can I keep doing it?  Yes.  One more step.  And now another.  Yes, keep going.  (Repeat thousands of days)

&amp;nbsp; 

**Borrowers Defense:**  Filed in 2018, still pending.  F--- that school (it’s closed and they got sued by a lot of people.)  

**PAYE:**     I pay the minimum for the next 14 years on the 20 year PAYE plan it will be around 38k total.  

**Tax Bomb:**  Around 16k.  I will save up 16k in the next 2 years as an emergency fund/ tax bomb coverage. 

**If I try and pay it off:**    75k+ interest of trying to pay that back over 5 years= over 85k!

&amp;nbsp; 

**THE GRAND PLAN:  PAYE, forgiveness, and tax bomb**= 54k. **I think I’ll wait this one out!**

I can start a different career because I don’t feel boxed in!     I can move closer to my family!    I can help out my parents!    I can buy the Pakt one travel bag that I’ve been ITCHING TO GET.   I GET TO PLAY THE SIMS!!  I can go on... vacation... for the first time in my life.  I have never been on a plane before.

&amp;nbsp; 

I have not been a huge earner.  You CAN do this making 30k + overtime or a second job.  You can switch jobs and make more.   There is nothing fun or easy about being on the grind, because that's exactly what it feels like.  But you CAN do it.    All it takes is time, hard work and being willing to be completely and utterly bored on a day to day basis.  Not getting derailed when emergencies happen (because they will happen) is essential.

t3_g48jc5,StudentLoans,Advice for paying off loans in light of CARES Act?,"Hi all,

So far I’ve taken $110k of debt down to $49.5. I have another $5k I can pay it down with. Around $24k is at 6.3% and the rest is 6.55%. I’ve been paying down the 6.55d quicker. But now under the CARES Act, interest on the 6.55s is 0 until September 30th. 6.3s are Federal loans but of a type that aren’t changed by the act so continue to accrue interest. 

So far job is steady though like everything else right now, no guarantee. Do have a significant emergency fund (more than they typically advise be put aside)

What is my best option for now:

1.  Pay down the 6.55s now since more will go to principal

2. Pay down the 6.3s even though the rate is lower

3. Put the amounts in high yield (1.9%) savings in case I ultimately need the cash then pay down the 6.55s shortly before September 30

Thoughts?

I'm set to graduate college in May with a Marketing degree, and I have a job lined up that will pay 45k per year with up to 10k in bonuses per year. I have 65k in loans over the 5 years I was in school. 38k is private through Sallie Mae and College Ave. 27k is federal. I've read that I should consider keeping my federal loans where they are at, but I need to refinance my private ones ASAP. My SM rates are between 7.25% and 11.75%. Obviously there's a lot of room for improvement there. 

My biggest thing is that I want to lower my interest rate and not pay a ridiculously high amount every month right out of college. For some strange reason, I'm kind of okay with potentially a 15+ year repayment option, and increase my payment amount as my salary grows. My reasoning for this is because my car is kind of starting to show its age, and I want something newer/more fun to drive since I'll have a long commute to work every day. Not a necessity by any means, but just something fun for me that I've wanted to do for a while. 

Where should I look to refinance to get the best long term rates possible? Of course I'll be shopping rates at a few places, but I need to get away from my private companies and get a better rate. Any advice is welcome!","Refinancing OptionsHey guys! I need some assistance with refinancing my student loans.

t3_g4dmhz,StudentLoans,"Just had an idea that could reduce my federal student loan interest rate, thoughts?","I have a significant amount of student loans from undergrad and then straight to 5 year grad program and barely made payments on them. I would say on average the interest rate from all loans is 6.8%

I have a savings account with Ally that pays 1.5% APR , a credit card that offers unlimited 2% cash back on all bill pays/transactions. If I put for example about 6 months worth of minimum payments lump sum in the savings account, used the credit card to pay my minimum payment loan gaining 2% CB, then paying the credit card right away from savings account which gained that 1.5% interest on the amount, would I be technically dropping my loan interest from 6.8% to 3.3%. all this of course would be setup with auto pay automatically (which actually lowers my interest rate by 0.25%). So final interest rate would be basically 3.05% without losing the benefits of having a federal loan if times get tough instead of refinancing with a private lender. 

Thoughts? Any advice appreciated!

Hey guys, I have been periodically posting my updates over the last year.

Last May I graduated with a masters degree and $55,000 in student loans and I have spent the last year aggressively repaying them back.

Though I have been paying back a regular $3,000/month like clockwork, my recent tax returns, reimbursed PTO, and my covid check have allowed me to recently deposit a few lump sum payments totaling $12,000.

In total, over the last 11 months I have paid back over $42,000 and I am currently just $14,000 in debt.

I am expecting an amended tax return of another $2,000, so that really just leaves $12,000 for me to take care of. At my current pace ($3,000/month), I expect to pay this off by August of 2020, which coincides with my 24th birthday.

Y'all, I'm friggin pumped. Student loans have been the only thing on my mind since I began college in 2014... While it has certainly been an emotionally difficult challenge, I feel blessed to have learned to meticulously manage my personal finances, a skill I don't plan on throwing away once I finish.","$42,000 down, $14,000 to go.[Visualization](https://imgur.com/a/Tm1nAF9)

I understand the Pros and cons, of additional loans and interest buildup. I am very good with money, and absolutely have a plan to combat this.

t3_g3yo4a,StudentLoans,Advice needed: I am overly obsessing about my loans,"I am obsessing about my student loans. I graduated with my Masters in Education in Counseling about 1.5 years ago. Despite my salary hoving around 40K (43K come September), I earn an additional max of $700 per month in working O/T (8 hours per week). I found out the hard way that working as a crisis phone counselor beyond 8 extra hours is beyond what I could handle; so 8 hrs is where it has remained. 

In 1.5 years I have already been able to throw 16K towards my debt bringing it to a total of 37K. The freeze on my interest rates (5.45%) and the forbearance is going to save me about 1K in interest over this six-month period. In which time I may be able to drop an 8K bomb on my loans come September by saving my typical monthly payment of $650 along with keeping up with the O/T work pace. 

I am going with the avalanche method as 3/4 of my smaller loans are sitting at 5.75% interest and my biggest (17K) is sitting at 4.75% interest. I even plan on using my upcoming raise in September to put an additional $100 per month towards my monthly loans bringing it up from $650 to $750. I have remained fairly disciplined with my budgeting and have decreased/eliminated poor habits like drinking or smoking which has saved me quite a bit. 

Aggressively, if I keep up this pace I could annihilate my loans in 2-3 more years. Conservatively, if I ease up on the aggression after this temporary student loan freeze, I am looking more at 4 more years. Though this does not take into account that I would hopefully be earning more in that time frame as well. But, I have no way of calculating how much that could be in my field. My LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor)  is now secured which opens up options for jobs I actually want with (hopefully) better pay. Yet this pandemic as thrown a huge wrench into that plan. In which case I am lucky and thankful to still be employed. 

Despite all this planning, I find myself on a nearly daily basis rewriting my budget, rewriting my student loan payment plan or reading article after article about finding more ways to save. Or hoping I'll come across a news article that confirms additional coronavirus financial assistance or that the Democrats plan to forgive 10-30K in loans is picking up traction (though I know this will not happen). 

This does not at all feel healthy to me anymore as I feel like I am circling the wagons rather than trusting that I am already doing all that I can. Can anyone relate to this? Any advice? Tips? Words of wisdom?","Advice needed: I am overly obsessing about my loansI am obsessing about my student loans. I graduated with my Masters in Education in Counseling about 1.5 years ago.

t3_g42y0e,StudentLoans,Advice for choosing a private loan?,"Hey! I'm new this process and I wanted to get some advice on taking out private student loans (recommendations, things you wish you knew). I am currently nearing the end of my first year at an out-of-state university, so tuition is quite high (basically 45k a year). My parents have paid for the first year but they cannot afford to anymore. They are willing to be co-sponsors of any loan I take but they do not want to take out the Parent PLUS loans because then the responsibility falls on the parent to pay it off.

I am planning to graduate in three years so I have to borrow for the next two years. I will be graduating with a computer science degree from a good public school so hopefully I will be able to have a steady income after graduation to pay off whatever debt I do rack up. I estimate around 80k-90k in private student loans after counting housing &amp; living costs, depending on how much I am able to work and what kinds of jobs I find for the summers.

Some questions I have are quite trivial like do I have to take out all my students loans for a year at once? My school offers a monthly payment option for each year so is it possible to take out 9 individual loans instead? I know different companies offer different flexibilities in repayment options but is there anything that I should keep my eye out for because of my situation? Any help is appreciated!

t3_g3u4zi,StudentLoans,So what does this CARES Act mean?,"I found this in my student loan inbox last night, from earlier this month.  There's no bill for later this month either.  I would like to continue paying my normal loan amount this month, but there's no bill for it.  Does this mean I shouldn't pay anything until I'm billing, probably after Sept 2020?  My loan is supposed to be forgiven next year.  Not paying means that potentially put back another six months.  I already got screwed over and had six payments not count, so the forgiveness date is six months behind what it's supposed to do.  I would like to continue normal payments.  I would NOT like to make payments and then be told, ""Oh, those payments don't count.  Whoever told you that was wrong,"" by the Public Service Loan Forgiveness tallying people.  That's what happened with previous payments when they tallied it up after the five year mark.  At least I've got something official in writing here.  






On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your federally owned loans that we service for ED.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.
In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program loans. If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:
●
0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.
●
Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.
Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.
Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends.","So what does this CARES Act mean?I found this in my student loan inbox last night, from earlier this month.

I see a lot of people posting this little blurb from the DOS website about how no country has a treaty with the US for the reciprocal enforcement of judgements. Right, there isn't a treaty. But that doesn't mean countries don't have mechanisms in place for enforcing foreign judgments. They all do and it works on the principle of reciprocity. If the foreign country has a history of enforcing the host countries' judgements, the host country in turn will enforce the foreign countries' judgements. The US has established reciprocity with almost every country in the world. This includes China. You can be sued here in the United States and that judgement can be brought to almost any country in the world and they will enforce it. Whether they will or not .. I'll get to that in a minute.

The bit about excessive money judgements ... that's about punitive damages. That has nothing to do with us. We owe money and it can proven that we are 100% liable for the money we owe.

On Statute of Limitations and Serving Papers. If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars on your head, they're going to sue you. And you don't have to be around for it either. Serving papers Is for the defendant's benefit. It's so the defendant can know about the lawsuit and have a chance to defend themselves. The plaintiff just has to try their best to find the defendant. If they do that, the judge will let them enter a motion for default judgement and grant it. ""Ah, but now the clock starts ticking"" No. The clock does not tick when you are hiding. This is true for the SOL on the time to bring suit and the SOL to enforce the judgement. You can't hide for 6 or whatever number of years and go ""AHA, you couldn't find me. Time's up"" So this leaving the country deal means that this problem will never go away.

If they can find you (and that's not hard these days) and the amount of money that they would spend to domesticate the judgement is less than the amount of money they would get from you, they will bring the judgement to your new country and have it enforced. There isn't anywhere you could really go to build up assets and be safe. Hate to say it.

Someones probably going to say like ""Well, I've never heard of this happening"" or ""This doesn't happen very often"". You've never heard of it because you aren't in a position to hear about it. These things are locked away in the civil court records of the local governments of these foreign countries. And you can't really know how often it happens without looking. What you've heard (or haven't heard) from people on reddit or google searches .. that's not a good sample. If anything, it's an echo chamber.

Is it totally pointless to go abroad? It does help you avoid AWG and Im sure you'd be fine for many, many years. But these loan balances are going to be huge in 10-20 years. People are going to have half a million, million dollar bounties on their heads. If you've built up assets, why wouldn't they come after you???","Post that was deleted on a sub that advocates for defaultThis was deleted and I was banned. Just a warning to anyone considering taking their advice.

edit: This is about moving overseas to avoid Student Loans. These are just my thoughts on the matter based on my own research.

Now with that out of the way, I obviously know that 100% scholarships are better in every way.

Also if I do end up applying for student loans can I still apply for scholarships and pay off my tuition using that to reduce the amount of student loans or can I only do one or the other?

I want to pay high, live frugal, and get it awaaaaaaay from me. 

So, I was looking at the first payment I made earlier this month and I noticed that almost half of it was applied to interest. The amount that was applied to interest was way more than the interest I have actually accrued. What is this? Why is this? Can I choose to only apply it to principal? I use Nelnet if this helps.

Will this affect my ability to pay off my loans quickly?

Do these people seek out others sharing last names and and call them just in case they know each other? Is it possible a rando put me down as a contact? Or is it neither and [redacted] doesn’t exist and it’s a convoluted layer to a scam

I just thought it was such a bizarre call, I’ve heard of the trouble Navient has gone through and googling the number yields robocall results but i was just so perplexed I had to ask a community that would be more knowledgeable",0,navient callhey folk hope well time question navient call start saying loan people never loan well work fairly skeptical call scam awareness earlier morning call voicemail human person full name however looking reach woman last name contact sister never person people seek others sharing last name call case possible put contact neither exist layer scam thought bizarre call trouble navient gone googling number robocall result ask community

t3_g2oewa,StudentLoans,0% Federal loan payment strategy question.,"TLDR on 10 year repayment plan, and started in November so basically 9.5 years left or so. So I have seen people say to not pay then do a lump sum payment at the end before interest starts back up. My question is which loan would be wiser to target. I pay $500 a month but had been paying an extra $100 towards a single low balance but high interest loan. There are two more loans with a larger balance and same high interest rate. For easy math and numbers let’s say 7% the lowest is 2,100 the second is 3,000 and the highest is 7,000. My thought is since I normally pay $600 a month, I should fully pay off the 3,000 loan. Over the 6 months and pay an extra $600 on the next smallest to get it gone faster. My thought is that it removes a loan completely and will never pay more interest on but lower the balance of the lowest one by the last $600 to start snowballing faster. Targeting the 7k would mean 3,4K left over and all 3 loans would have the same interest rate. I guess you could say I have one loan of 12,100 at 7% so does it even really matter?

Looking for some advice, I have a decent emergency fund built up and plan on paying the debt instead of keeping the savings.","0% Federal loan payment strategy question.TLDR on 10 year repayment plan, and started in November so basically 9.5 years left or so. So I have seen people say to not pay then do a lump sum payment at the end before interest starts back up. My question is which loan would be wiser to target. I pay $500 a month but had been paying an extra $100 towards a single low balance but high interest loan. There are two more loans with a larger balance and same high interest rate. For easy math and numbers let’s say 7% the lowest is 2,100 the second is 3,000 and the highest is 7,000. My thought is since I normally pay $600 a month, I should fully pay off the 3,000 loan. Over the 6 months and pay an extra $600 on the next smallest to get it gone faster.

t3_g2h31c,StudentLoans,Employer Student Loan Contribution: Job Change Q,"Mid-career professional.  $50K in federal student loan debt (Mohela).  Loans are consolidated, interest rate \~3.5%.

Current job stinks, but they offer $10K/ year in student loan payments- after taxes it's about $6,300.  I have rec'd 2 payments over the last 2 years and am eligble for at least one more, possibly another 3 after that.  With these and ongoing payments, per my service provider, I can pay off in about 5 years.  

I rec'd an offer (lateral) which I think will be a better position, but no student loan payment benefit.

I am in the now defunct graduated repayment plan which has no cap re years.  Mohela said I do not qualify for the 25 year ceiling and would make payments through 2037 (!).  Im about 17 years in.

I have put in for PLSF and am awaiting a denial (graduated repayment plan does not qualify) so I can appeal under the tPLSF which was created in 2018.

t3_g2gmsm,StudentLoans,Is $125k too much to take out in loans?,"Let me know if this isn’t the right place to ask these kinds of questions!

I’m headed to law school in the fall and was accepted to two really great schools. The one that I want to attend more was going to cost me ~$65k in tuition and ~$60k in living expenses across the three years, so $125k in total. Coming out of law school, I would probably start out at $50k salary for the type of law I want to practice. The school has a LRAP to cover 100% of loans paid each for 10 years with a salary cap of $65k, and only allows for 1 year of a break (ie, maternity leave).

The debt scared me, a lot. I ended up depositing at a school that isn’t as exciting to me and will cost me &lt;$60k in living expenses only (free tuition scholarship). This school does not have a LRAP.

No one in my family has had to take out this much in loans before and so I feel pretty financially illiterate when it comes to loans. For both schools, I qualified for the max amount of Federal Direct ($20.5k) and for the ideal school, I would apply for Federal Grad Plus. From what I understand, they currently have interest rates of ~ 6% and 7%, respectively, but those are expected to decrease thanks to COVID. From the perspective of people who are working to pay of loans, do you think that debt ($125k plus interest) would be manageable? I don’t necessarily think I need assurance that I made the right choice, but like I said, I feel pretty financially illiterate and will have loans either way so I’m just trying to get a feel for reality of life with loans like this.","Is $125k too much to take out in loans?Let me know if this isn’t the right place to ask these kinds of questions!

t3_g2l17q,StudentLoans,Student Loan Payoff Plan,"Hi all,

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on my student loan repayment plan as I am entering repayment in a couple months and would like to make sure that my payment plan minimizes interest payment.

A little background, I am a recent graduate who is currently only working part-time, however I am searching for full-time jobs (Although it's hard with current events). This should help boost my income and how much I can pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

My current loans are as follows:

|Loan|Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal Sub|3500|4.29%|
|Federal Sub|5500|3.76%|
|Federal Unsub|2500|3.76%|
|Federal Sub|5500|4.45%|
|Federal Sub|5500|5.05%|
|Perkins|2000|5.00%|

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to payoff the Perkins loan because it is through Heartland ECSI, and I have not heard a single good thing about them so I would like to get rid of this one as soon as possible.

After that, I plan on making minimum payments and paying extra towards the high interest loans. Once I have paid off up to the 4.29% loan, I plan on just making minimum payments on the 3.76% loans and saving more towards retirement. I am hoping to pay this off in around a year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Does my plan sound okay? Are there any other repayment options I should be considering?

t3_g28ta5,StudentLoans,Future stimulus?,"My wife and I are down to about $40k in student loans, all federal, down from approx. $120k when we got married about 5 years ago.  She works a stable job that makes enough to support the family, and I'm currently between jobs but likely only briefly.

t3_g2g8wa,StudentLoans,Why you shouldn't use loan forgiveness,"So I explained in the Dave Ramsey subreddit why he is wrong about these programs. Wrong in execution not on if you should or not. Here is why and the real reason why these programs suck.

Example: 

You make 50k a year and your loan is 150k and you're on income based repayment. One of the plans is 20% of you discretionary income. So let's say after essentials are paid you have 1k left so 20% is 200/month. Now these aren't exact numbers but close enough.

Average student loan interest: 5.8%

Payment: $200

Per month interest: ~ $724

After 300 months, your loan will have a balance of 490k... So now that gets forgiven, great! You now have to pay 35% income tax on 499+50k which is around 192k. Yes someone making 50k even if you got a 2% raise every year is only 90k won't be able to afford that and guess what, the IRS will garnish your wages and social security. And the taxes on the forgiveness is more than your initial loan.

Moral of the story, find a way to pay down your loans!","Why you shouldn't use loan forgivenessSo I explained in the Dave Ramsey subreddit why he is wrong about these programs. Wrong in execution not on if you should or not. Here is why and the real reason why these programs suck.

t3_g1ng27,StudentLoans,Using graduate school federal loans for undergraduate private loans?,"I don't know if my idea is good or not and I tried searching around to see if anyone else had done it but couldn't really find anything.

I graduated with my bachelor's degree at the end of 2019. I have about $70,000 in private student loan debt through Sallie Mae (I know, I know, if I could go back in time I'd do a lot of things differently). I was recently accepted to graduate school and got offered about $10,000 per semester in financial aid. I'd only need about half of that to cover tuition, so would it be a bad idea to take the max amount and use the rest to pay off a chunk of the Sallie Mae debt? After about 2 years this would virtually convert 1/3 of my private debt to federal debt, which I feel would be great for lots of different reasons (e.g. better repayment plans and better chance of being federally discharged). Is there anything I'm missing or not thinking about?","Using graduate school federal loans for undergraduate private loans?I don't know if my idea is good or not and I tried searching around to see if anyone else had done it but couldn't really find anything.

t3_g1v91j,StudentLoans,Refinance v Consolidate,"Hi all, my wife has about $115k in parent plus loan under her dad's name. Her parents aren't the most financially literate  and were gamed in to signing up for a bunch of those to finance her undergrad degree (didn't understand that she could take out loans herself, and refused to hear anything contrary to what they wanted to do). I'm not even sure if they realize that they are liable for those loans. She make about 60k currently a year out of school and we chose to sign up for the graduated 10 yr plan and pay approx $800/mo which will increase in 2021. We want to get those loans out from under her parents. One option is to refi and take advantage of her credit to lower the interest rate and be able to claim interest paid on our taxes (currently cannot even though we are paying them). The second option is to consolidate them federally under her name (again we'd likely get a better rate). My question is should we consolidate (potentially taking advantage of an income driven plan) under the assumption that something politically has got to give over the next few years and some amount of federal debt will be forgiven, or should we refinance and loose out on any federally held benefits? Between the two of us we make about $115k after tax (I would like to avoid cosigning of possible), so a 800 a month payment now isn't a massive burden (though annoying considering we aren't really tackling any principal) but the later graduated payments certainly will be a larger percentage of our budget. We are planning to take advantage of this 0% interest period go save a chunk in a high yeild savings account and pay off as much as we can before making a decision.

TL:DR should we refinance parent plus loans or federally consolidate?","Refinance v ConsolidateHi all, my wife has about $115k in parent plus loan under her dad's name.

Assuming I do not lose my job this year (far from a guarantee), I should have it down to about 170k by January 2021. In a year or two, I will likely end up changing jobs and taking a paycut. Right now I make 190k.

My question is simply whether it makes sense to continue throwing as much as I can at the loans when and if I take a paycut (not sure how big that paycut would be, but assume for argument's sake I go from 190k to no lower than 100k).

Lots of people on IDR plans , especially PAYE plan which is for people with financial hardship have outstanding interest on their account prior to march13 ... and since this Forbearance was automatically put on all accounts , it would Not be fair for outstanding interest to capitalize.

t3_g1j7ed,StudentLoans,How to best use 0% APR to pay off my Student Debt?,"Hi fellow borrowers and advisers!

I've been reading and it looks like it can be pretty risky unless you are sure you can pay off the debt on the credit card in full by the end of the introductory period. 

Since it can be risky to transfer all my debt, can it still help to transfer a portion of it?

And if I pay off in full, is there any consequences to keeping the credit card open? I heard you shouldn't close credit cards, even if you're not using them, because it can be helpful to have that credit history still available since it establishes a line of trust.","How to best use 0% APR to pay off my Student Debt?Hi fellow borrowers and advisers!

t3_g1e4os,StudentLoans,NFCC certified counselor assigned to me says I'm doing things wrong?,"To start, I have about 100k in student loans and make about 35k a year. (I know that sucks but I'm in higher ed and the jobs are just not full time or year round so it's the best I can do for now) My husband makes somewhere between 2-3x more than me with no debt.

So my spouse and I have separate finances but we live together and have a child (and another on the way) 

My husband bought the house we live in before we were married. We live in California and have a high cost of living so expenses are high despite having one of the cheaper smaller houses available. 

We dont have a joint account we both contribute to. We both pay separate bills. He pays the mortgage and some utilities and I pay for other bills and do most of the grocery shopping etc. He doesnt tell me exactly what he makes and I dont tell him exactly what I make. We dont veto/ask each other about purchases... etc. Basically we arent comingling finances as much as we possibly can. 

We file our taxes as married filing separately. I dont report his income on my taxes and he doesn't report mine on his taxes. From my understanding this is all fine for tax purposes even though California is a community property state specifically because we don't mix our money or have knowledge of the details of each other's income.

When I have applied for income based repayment before (repaye would be a better option but I have ffel loans and havent decided if consolidating is a good idea yet)  they usually ask me to submit tax info, which I do, and then they (probably) ask if I live with my spouse and I say of course that I do, and then when they ask if I have his income information available or have any ability to get it, I check off that I do not because we dont share that information with eachother.

So that being said, we are doing our taxes ourselves this year for the first time since being married and the topic of student loans comes up and my husband wants me to look into if I am on the best repayment plan etc. I want to prepare  for and anticipate the tax bomb at the end of it and such ... so I decide to run some of the free calculators and contact the nfcc on their student loan branch to see if they have any advice on whether I should consolidate and do repaye or what... 

Well I was matched with a counseling agency and their counselor tells me I should have been reporting my spouses income all this time despite the things I mentioned above and that everyone who is married and living together for 6 months or more since 2015 has been required to report spousal income each year ... and additionally that there is some sort of cosigner form my husband should have had to sign each year before I could get on an income based plan (that doesnt make him responsible for my loans) as I mentioned I'm currently on IBR and had no issues.

I've never had the website demand my husbands info or ask him to sign anything so her reports just dont align with what I've seen. When I told her this she said lots of people have been caught for not reporting spousal income when they have to etc. And that the government loses X amount to this kind of fraudulent reporting each year etc... They did an investigation into it and decided to crack down recently... yada yada.... And that basically the department of education expects that if you are married and live together, then you have access to each other's finances and what you are required to report on taxes etc doesnt matter. Then she basically said if my husband wont tell me his income then I cant legally qualify for any income based repayment plans.

This is contrary to so many things I've read online and my own experience with the application so I didnt really know what to say. If I have to report my husbands income but he wont tell me what it is exactly... or if I convince him to tell me but our payments shoot up to an unmanageable level for our situation because of that... I dont want to assume she is correct if there is a better way, but it seems like the nfcc site assigned me to this one agency and (I asked and) she is the only student aid specialized counselor there... 

I want to get a second initial nonprofit specialist opinion if I can but I'm not sure where to go for that. Do you have any experience with speaking to a free nonprofit counselor regarding this issue?  I'm sure im not the only one doing this because I've seen a lot of advice online of people in my same situation doing what im doing ... the woman I talked to said she had 20+years experience but so much of what she said doesnt seem to align with what I've heard and experienced I just hope she is wrong. She said that the loan servicers dont always make it clear what is needed or something and it is a big problem.","NFCC certified counselor assigned to me says I'm doing things wrong?To start, I have about 100k in student loans and make about 35k a year. (I know that sucks but I'm in higher ed and the jobs are just not full time or year round so it's the best I can do for now) My husband makes somewhere between 2-3x more than me with no debt.

So my spouse and I have separate finances but we live together and have a child (and another on the way) 

My husband bought the house we live in before we were married. We live in California and have a high cost of living so expenses are high despite having one of the cheaper smaller houses available. 

We dont have a joint account we both contribute to. We both pay separate bills. He pays the mortgage and some utilities and I pay for other bills and do most of the grocery shopping etc. He doesnt tell me exactly what he makes and I dont tell him exactly what I make. We dont veto/ask each other about purchases... etc. Basically we arent comingling finances as much as we possibly can. 

We file our taxes as married filing separately. I dont report his income on my taxes and he doesn't report mine on his taxes. From my understanding this is all fine for tax purposes even though California is a community property state specifically because we don't mix our money or have knowledge of the details of each other's income.

When I have applied for income based repayment before (repaye would be a better option but I have ffel loans and havent decided if consolidating is a good idea yet)  they usually ask me to submit tax info, which I do, and then they (probably) ask if I live with my spouse and I say of course that I do, and then when they ask if I have his income information available or have any ability to get it, I check off that I do not because we dont share that information with eachother.

So that being said, we are doing our taxes ourselves this year for the first time since being married and the topic of student loans comes up and my husband wants me to look into if I am on the best repayment plan etc. I want to prepare  for and anticipate the tax bomb at the end of it and such ... so I decide to run some of the free calculators and contact the nfcc on their student loan branch to see if they have any advice on whether I should consolidate and do repaye or what... 

Well I was matched with a counseling agency and their counselor tells me I should have been reporting my spouses income all this time despite the things I mentioned above and that everyone who is married and living together for 6 months or more since 2015 has been required to report spousal income each year ... and additionally that there is some sort of cosigner form my husband should have had to sign each year before I could get on an income based plan (that doesnt make him responsible for my loans) as I mentioned I'm currently on IBR and had no issues.

I've never had the website demand my husbands info or ask him to sign anything so her reports just dont align with what I've seen. When I told her this she said lots of people have been caught for not reporting spousal income when they have to etc. And that the government loses X amount to this kind of fraudulent reporting each year etc...

t3_g161a3,StudentLoans,How should I allocate student loan payments during 0% interest rate period?,"Thank you in advance for responding! Any information would be helpful. I have quite the large student loan that I have been trying to pay back. It’s been extremely slow-going and I feel like I haven’t made much progress. When the announcement was made that the interest accrual rate would be suspended until September, I thought now would be a good time to attack my loans.

I was previously using the snowball method for paying back my loans. I would have a small automatic payment spread out between all my loans but then I would throw whatever extra money I had at the loan with the highest interest rate to pay that down faster. 

So now that things have changed with the interest rate and all automatic payments have stopped, here is my question: Should I make a payment spread out across all loans or should I continue to throw all my money at the loan with the highest interest rate?

Thank you!!!

Edit: I won’t be making payments right now. My plan was to save during this time of uncertainty and just pay a lump sum in September.

t3_g19mmj,StudentLoans,"If I drop a class that was originally paid for with grad PLUS loans, do I have to send that money back?","This is kind of a confusing situation, so I will do my best to explain my predicament. I am a US graduate student in a medical profession currently living on federal loans - direct unsubsidized and grad PLUS loans. Like everyone else, my spring semester has been heavily affected by the pandemic.

So here's the situation: I am a full-time student but the curriculum worked out so I was originally signed up for 13 credit hours (rather than 15, which is full-time), so I was charged $1200 less for tuition because I was not full-time per my college. This was discovered and worked out awhile ago - my COA was less and everything was fine. Well now that we've been pulled from rotations, we were required to pick up another elective. This pushed me to 16 credit hours, which is full time. The school charged me the extra $1200, I applied for an additional grad PLUS loan to pay that off. I hope you're following me so far.

We had a mini-uprising (not really, but it's good for the drama) about paying more money to do less school, so the school allowed us to drop the additional elective. Now I'm back to the original 13 credits, and that $1200 was treated as a refund and sent to me via direct deposit.

Now my question is, am I obligated to give that money back since my COA is technically back to the original amount (which did NOT include the $1200)? I could really use the money right now, but I don't want to pay off my bills with that money and then the government turns around and demands I pay it back. Ya know? I have a LOT of loans (my degree is really stupid expensive), so piling more on top of it isn't really an issue. 

So tl;dr - if I drop a class that was already paid for with federal loans, am I required to send the money back?","If I drop a class that was originally paid for with grad PLUS loans, do I have to send that money back?This is kind of a confusing situation, so I will do my best to explain my predicament. I am a US graduate student in a medical profession currently living on federal loans - direct unsubsidized and grad PLUS loans.

t3_g0f0jq,StudentLoans,Sign the #MakeZeroPermanent Petition Now to Show Your Support for 0% Interest on All Student Loans Forever,"This is the first time I’ve been “politically active” about something in a very long time. But I think now we have a window of opportunity to move the narrative on the topic of student loan reform. We need to do something about it now.

I think outright loan forgiveness is probably too difficult a pill to swallow. But I think we can get a couple of meaningful changes done right now if we indicate to our politicians how important this is. The petition I’ve drafted calls for 2 things:

1. It calls for the government to make 0% interest on student loans permanent.

They’ve already authorized it for 6 months. It would be very easy to refinance all student loan debt right now. They are doing this for Corporate America. They should do it for our students.

2. It calls for an additional 18-month holiday on ALL student loan payments so that we hopefully ensure a smooth economic recovery after the COVID-19 Crisis.

I really don’t see what’s controversial about this proposal. I think it just needs to get done. And for that to happen, we need people to rally around this cause.

t3_g19xs5,StudentLoans,I have an option of lowering my monthly payment or reversing the payment until the end of Payment schedule. I'm not sure which one to pick. Any help would be appreciated.,"Sorry if this isn't the best subreddit to post this, but I need some advice.
So here's the thing, I'm currently paying around $350 a month towards my outstanding balance. Unfortunately I can't afford that anymore due to current circumstances. I contacted my school's financial offices,  and they told me that I have two options. Either I could lower my monthly payment amount, or ""reversing the payments for April and May to the end of the payment schedule"".

I'm not exactly sure what a payment reversal does; I googled it and all I got from it was that money was returned to the buyer, and I'm not sure if I'm the buyer  in this situation. Also, I fear that they will add the balance I owed for April and May to the last payment I make, which would be overwhelming. 

I'm currently leaning to just lowering my payment because the other option is too complicated, unless someone can explain what ""reversing the payments for April and May to the end of the payment schedule"" means. Any help is welcomed!","I have an option of lowering my monthly payment or reversing the payment until the end of Payment schedule. I'm not sure which one to pick.

t3_g167ac,StudentLoans,Pretty sure I should switch back to IBR from REPAYE but ...,"I keep getting conflicting info whenever I call my servicer (MOHELA). So I have about 200K left on my med school loans. For whatever reason I switched to REPAYE a few years ago which has really ballooned my payments.

My understanding is that then I would be eligible for IBR and they'd only count my income, not my wife's. 

What I want to make sure is that I'm still eligible for IBR. When I plug our incomes into my servicer's repayment estimator, it does look like I'd be eligible if we file separately but not jointly. I need to have a ""partial financial hardship"" but I'm having a hard time finding a simple calculator online to make sure I'm still eligible.

t3_g0plaj,StudentLoans,Taking Advantage of Forbearance Period,"This may be a non-conventional strategy, but I thought it was interesting and a good idea for the current state we are living in. As almost everyone knows, all federal loans have had their interest brought down to 0% until October as well as many will be receiving a stimulus check in the next few weeks.

Like I am sure many people that still have stable work may have thought, ""wow this a great time to attack the principal of my loans"" using the 6 months and stimulus check to put a hefty dent on their loans. This was going to be my plan as well, until I had thought of holding off any payments during the 6 months, putting them in a high yield savings account until the period is over for extra security during this unstable time. If things were still stable at that time, I can simply apply the lump sum and it would be the same as applying it over time, as well as gaining a bit of interest.

Discussing this with my wife, she thought this would delay the date of our payments. Obviously it did not, but it got me thinking to see if I can leverage this time to reduce the amount of time we are paying for.

Background on my wife and I: 65k student loans, 2 years out of school. Living in LCOL making over 120k combined. Getting married last year put a **big** dent on our savings, and we are slowly recovering (Adding $500/month). Currently with a 3-month emergency fund wanting to get to 6 months. 

TL;DR

**Strategy**: Put any money that would go toward student loans/stimulus check into emergency fund for 6 month forbearance. 

**Result**: Freed up $500/month for student loan payments approximately 1 year sooner than expected, paying off loans \~4 months earlier than if applying funds during forbearance, while expediting completion of emergency fund.

After someone's post yesterday about Nelnet finally setting interest to zero, I checked my account and was delighted to see my accrued interest rolled back as well. However, I made three payments after March 13th and only one has been reversed to have the entire payment put towards principal. Here's what it looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

|*Payment Date*|*Payment Amount*|*Applied to principal* |*Applied to interest*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**March 27**|$704.06|$704.06|$0|
|**March 16**|$500|$435.73|$64.27|
|**March 15** (auto pay)|$341.25|$155.99|$185.26|

Has this happened to anyone else? Should these two other payments have been reversed to put the entire payment towards principal or is there a clause somewhere that explains what's happening here?

Curious to see what others are experiencing. Thanks for the help!","Nelnet has rolled back my interest except for two former payments made after 3/13Hey All!

t3_g0r41v,StudentLoans,Picking a lower repayment plan to pay more on principal balance,"I’m graduating soon and picking which payment plan I’ll be on - it’s between income driven and standard. I could technically afford standard but I can’t pay much extra if I do. I want to make extra payments that are allocated to principal balance after I pay my mandatory monthly balance. I’ve heard you could type a letter to your provider with directions to do this with extra payments i.e. do not allocate across all interest but to the principal balance of the loan with highest interest rate, and then allocate to xyz, etc etc, and they will do it! 

So question # 1:

I want to pick a plan where I pay less (income driven), so I can pay more towards principal balance in the form of extra payments each month. This will reduce what I pay in the long run, right?! Its making too much sense in my head, but I don’t know of anyone else who has done this or posted about it on the internet. 

Question # 2:

Would I have this option if I consolidated or would I only be able to have this option if I have multiple loans? 

Question #3:

For now I need to pay only on the interest because that will capitalize when I start a plan no matter who the provider or what plan, correct?

t3_g08u1p,StudentLoans,What are the fiscally responsible options I have in this unique situation with financial aid?,"\[x-posting here from r/personalfinance\]

tldr at the end.

Here's the situation:

I am well into my undergrad degree and have had several complications in my disbursement of financial aid this year. My campus offices of Financial Aid, the Bursar, and the Registrar all seem very helpful, but I do not believe specific issues with my financial aid in paying for college have been fully communicated to me, nor have my steps for how to resolve them been clearly laid out or even communicated between offices. It's a frustrating situation that I believe will have a positive outcome, but I'm beginning to grow concerned about being put in a disadvantageous financial situation; especially with our current global concerns.

I transferred to my institution in the Fall of this year. I came into the Winter Quarter 4 weeks late on account of my financial aid not disbursing for Fall Quarter; the issue was that I had not completed the CSS profile, not known it to be a requirement for all students to complete, and not been able to complete it until 2 weeks after I called the office at the beginning of the quarter to register - only to find a hold on my account. I had received a few calls from the Bursar telling me about the balance and been trying to tell them that my financial aid should have already disbursed or been on its way, but I had not received any calls from the financial aid office to let me know the problem - none my aid could not disburse until I completed the CSS profile. Completing it required 3rd party documentation for my personal situation, so I assumed it to be an additional \*option\* for additional FA from College Board, and opted not to complete it out of concern for my family's privacy. Between finding out about the issue, requesting &amp; receiving documentation, and completing the profile, we were two 2 weeks into Winter Quarter. I wish I had been more proactive in discovering the issue and resolving it, but the quarter had already begun, and I registered late. The issue was on me. Receiving approval from my instructors and successfully enrolling had to be done in person and on paper at the Office of the Registrar and took another 2 weeks to finalize before I was fully enrolled.

This minor inconvenience was only the wind-up for the potentially severe issue I am running into now, bringing me to this Spring Quarter:

I went back and forth on whether or not to register for Spring Quarter. I had personal health and financial concerns about registering for this quarter. Between the financial risks of COVID-19 and everything else going on in my life, I still decided to register for online classes, only to find a near $10k outstanding balance on my account, when I had been informed by the Financial Aid office in Winter that the balance would be paid in full with the aid I was expecting; with a $2k return from the loan after payment (I'm not sure what the exact term for this is, but the balance was expected to be paid in excess of $2,000). Part of my financial aid, a federal loan, was meant to cover a majority of tuition, but the applications for it are canceled automatically by Financial Aid 4 weeks into the term for any students who have yet to register for 8 or more credits. My financial aid was completed and confirmed 2 weeks into that term, but I was not able to fully register until the mid-4th week because of some red-tape (I can elaborate on this more if anyone requests it, but it doesn't seem financially relevant, so I'm excluding it). This meant that an outstanding balance totaling near 10-grand would remain on my account from the Fall and Winter terms. Despite having been in constant communication with the Bursar for two weeks lifting my registration holds at the OoFA's request, the balance I was informed to expect full payment of would remain because most of the aid would be canceled automatically by the FA Office. I couldn't find a notice about this cancellation from the federal government or any office from the school. I was no longer receiving calls from any office for the duration of Winter term after registering. I would not have registered and accrued more debt from the term if there was no guarantee that I could pay for it; instead, I would have preferred to take the term off and resolve this issue so it didn't affect my grades (I was going to my professors' classes for the first 4 weeks, but not having access to Canvas for half the term ended up taking a chunk out of my GPA). So that's what I decided to do this term, temporarily withdraw, take some time to simplify my financial aid situation, avoid any other surprises with tuition, and come in strong next Fall Quarter (online classes are not good for my learning style, in any case). I thought I was making a sensible decision financially. Evidently, this would not be the case.

After seeing the balance at the beginning of this term and calling the Financial Aid office to see what went wrong, they discovered that one of my federal loans was scheduled to disburse for both terms, but never did. Knowing this, and not being able to register for classes, I decided to communicate the situation to my institution by submitting a temporary withdrawal until Fall 2020 and avoid incurring additional debt for the term before resolving the issue on my student account.

It was only after this point that I learned what I mentioned earlier, that one must be enrolled in 8 credits for any Federal Aid to be disbursed retroactively. It was only two weeks into this term that I learned my federal loan was canceled by the Office of Financial Aid two months ago without any institutional notice. I was registered for over 8 credits for the remainder of the term and could have corrected this issue with a retroactive disbursement had I known to ask for it, but now that I have not been registered, the deadline for a 100% tuition refund for dropped classes has passed. Meaning I can't simply lift the hold on my account, register for 8 credits, wait for my retroactive disbursement and drop the classes. Leaving me stuck between paying a 10-grand balance on my account, or &gt;50% tuition for classes I will not be taking for more than a week. I was willing to eat the monthly late fees and enroll for Summer or Fall term and have the aid disbursed then, but I have been informed by the FA office that the aid will not disburse unless I am enrolled in 8 or more credits this Spring Term. At this point, I will be missing more than 3 weeks of classes, at best.

I do not know how I could have communicated more with these offices, why I wasn't informed about this situation, why I needed to coordinate solutions to it in the style of a detective and messenger between all 3 offices instead of systems for communication existing for unique and unexpected situations like this one. Most importantly, I do not know how I can approach this situation in a financially responsible or safe way. This whole thing is seeming more like an impossible and unexpected issue, and I do not hold the offices totally at fault. It seems like an automated clerical accident and a lot of unfortunate timing. All I would like to do is take the proper steps to efficiently and finally resolve this.

My last hope will be to apply for a formal tuition appeal this week to waive the 50% fee and have the aid disburse before I withdraw. If that doesn't happen, I've been referred by the FA office directly to Sally Mae or Wells Fargo for a private loan... I never believed my institution could leave us so out in the cold like that. I can't take on the additional debt, it would be hard to swallow when we were expecting a 2-grand return from the federal loan after paying for both quarters. It's a discouraging situation, but what advice do you have for me? And what options would you recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Registered for classes 4 weeks into last term b/c of an unexpected issue w/ my financial aid. Turns out that's around the same time that the FA office cancels financial aid requests for students who aren't registered for 8 or more credits, resulting in a surprising 2nd financial aid holdup this term and a 9k outstanding balance on my account from a canceled federal loan that I was not made aware of in the 6 weeks I was actually registered to resolve it. My decision is now between a private loan to cover the balance or greater than half of this term's tuition for 8 credits I will not be enrolled in more than 7-10 days of - just to have the loans disburse retroactively.","What are the fiscally responsible options I have in this unique situation with financial aid?\[x-posting here from r/personalfinance\]

tldr at the end.

Here's the situation:

I am well into my undergrad degree and have had several complications in my disbursement of financial aid this year. My campus offices of Financial Aid, the Bursar, and the Registrar all seem very helpful, but I do not believe specific issues with my financial aid in paying for college have been fully communicated to me, nor have my steps for how to resolve them been clearly laid out or even communicated between offices. It's a frustrating situation that I believe will have a positive outcome, but I'm beginning to grow concerned about being put in a disadvantageous financial situation; especially with our current global concerns.

I transferred to my institution in the Fall of this year. I came into the Winter Quarter 4 weeks late on account of my financial aid not disbursing for Fall Quarter; the issue was that I had not completed the CSS profile, not known it to be a requirement for all students to complete, and not been able to complete it until 2 weeks after I called the office at the beginning of the quarter to register - only to find a hold on my account. I had received a few calls from the Bursar telling me about the balance and been trying to tell them that my financial aid should have already disbursed or been on its way, but I had not received any calls from the financial aid office to let me know the problem - none my aid could not disburse until I completed the CSS profile.

""...when your loan goes back into repayment, any interest that accrued during the forbearance period prior to March 13, 2020, will capitalize, which means that any outstanding interest will be added to your principal balance."" 

Then right below this paragraph it reads: 

""Until further notice from ED, interest will not accrue on your account. However, if you had interest on your account prior to March 13, 2020, it **may** be capitalized and applied to your account balance at the end of the forbearance.""

However, AES is only offering a 90 day forbearance and stating that interest may still accrue during this time, and I have to request it, it's not automatically kicking in.

t3_fz5nvb,StudentLoans,Self-proclaimed PSA to high school seniors weighing expensive college options involving heavy student loan debt burdens.,"We're all obviously living in uncertain times, but one thing is certain, degrees are no longer worth today's inflated tuition prices.

Every passing semester, degrees become less valuable as a new batch of graduates enter the job market. This virus is mimicking the 2008 financial &amp; job market crash, but on steroids because *every industry &amp; every country* is affected *all at once.*

I highly recommend searching this sub for stories that students of the past have/had with soul-crushing debt loads (plus interest). If they could go back in time, they'd make different financial choices to reduce their debt loads.

The point I'm trying to make is to not repeat history by *immediately* going to a 4-year school, and taking on unnecessary debt (for the first 2 years), to which the 4-year degree is absolutely not guaranteed to land a high paying job after 4 years.

Keep your tuition &amp; debt load low by first going to Community College in order to get those BS General Education classes out of the way, then transfer to the school you want. Who knows, maybe they'll offer a better financial aid package *not involving* *~~massive~~* *loans* in the future.

If it's the social-life you're worried about, there's 2 answers to this:

* Because of this virus, now almost every University is moving to online-only classes and it's going to stay that way for quite some time. There's no point in paying 5 to 6-figures in tuition (plus fees) for a University campus you won't even physically step foot on.
* If this virus *wasn't* here, then nothing's stopping you from just physically going with your friends to a 4-year school on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights. Nobody's going to go around asking for your school ID, just to attend some weekend party with other 18-20 year olds. Besides, once they turn 21, those students usually start leaving campus to go to more mature bars &amp; clubs in the biggest city near you. So you're not really missing much in the grand scheme of things, except the debt.","Self-proclaimed PSA to high school seniors weighing expensive college options involving heavy student loan debt burdens.We're all obviously living in uncertain times, but one thing is certain, degrees are no longer worth today's inflated tuition prices.

t3_fzzbw8,StudentLoans,"Thinking of consolidating my student loans, should I wait after grad school?","HI everyone,

So I'm planning for the future, and part of my worry is not affording my loan payments. Currently am wrapping up my long undergraduate journey. I have about 26K in student loans. I'm applying to a teaching credential program. I have to apply to the TEACH grant (which is not guaranteed due to some eligibility issues) and look into other methods (most likely loans). I am also planning on graduate school in the future (more loans). I mostly will qualify for IDR plan like PAYE and I am going to rely on PSLF.

**However, the biggest concern I have is when I should consolidate my loans?** I only have federal loans (direct and Perkins). So should I just wait after graduate school?  Since I only plan on state schools, I know I will most likely have to take less than 8k in private loans for graduate school.  But I do have a hefty amount right now.

I would appreciate any and all advice! I'm struggling to find these answers to these questions.","Thinking of consolidating my student loans, should I wait after grad school?HI everyone,

So I'm planning for the future, and part of my worry is not affording my loan payments. Currently am wrapping up my long undergraduate journey. I have about 26K in student loans. I'm applying to a teaching credential program. I have to apply to the TEACH grant (which is not guaranteed due to some eligibility issues) and look into other methods (most likely loans). I am also planning on graduate school in the future (more loans). I mostly will qualify for IDR plan like PAYE and I am going to rely on PSLF.

**However, the biggest concern I have is when I should consolidate my loans?** I only have federal loans (direct and Perkins). So should I just wait after graduate school?

t3_g03eom,StudentLoans,"Refinanced student loans, credit score dropped","This should maybe be in a more general finance subreddit but it’s about my student loans so I thought I’d give here a try. I recently refinanced my student loans for a much better interest rate, so my new debtor paid off my old loan and I now pay the new company. However, once my old student loan account closed, my credit score dropped 15 points!

I have a very good credit score so in the scheme of things it’s not a big deal, but I’m assuming the closure of an old account (maybe 12 years) and the opening of new account shifted the average age of accounts which caused my score to drop. 

Websites suggest keeping loans open as long as possible to avoid this, but then aren’t you just paying more in interest?? This makes no sense!!!

t3_fzyc18,StudentLoans,Beneficial to put suspended IDR payments into a 529?,"For those on an Income-Driven Repayment plan, it might make sense to put your suspended monthly payments into a state 529 investment fund.

[Currently, all federal IDR plan payments are suspended, these next 6 months count towards your monthly plan even if you don't pay anything.](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/)

[This year in the SECURE act the 529 plan now allows a person to use $10k for every dependent they have a plan for (including yourself) towards student loan payments.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/020217/can-i-pay-student-loans-my-529-plan.asp) Some states you can list yourself as a dependent so confirm before doing so. That way you can withdrawal from the fund for every monthly payment until you meet your $10k lifetime withdrawal. Every dependent you have is another additional $10k you can remove.

A 529 plan is a college savings plan that [offers tax and financial aid benefits](https://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/name-the-top-7-benefits-of-529-plans). 529 plans may also be used to [save and invest for K-12 tuition](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-funding-strategies-private-school-tuition) in addition to college costs. Almost every state has it's own 529 plan and provides incentives to put money into one. My state allows for a deduction of up to $4k on STATE income tax. Typically there is a 10% tax on all stock gains, but you won't be taxed on this if it is going towards education or student loans. Even if you don't end up using it for education, then you can still withdraw from it, but you will have to pay the typical tax penalty as any other investment fund.

**Things to consider:**

* I am blessed and have not been laid off so I can afford to do this, and I have emergency savings to protect me if the COVID situation gets hairier.
* Some states do not allow you to pay for student loans. Check the state's rules
* You can buy a 529 from any state, even if you don't live there or your dependents don't live there. It's likely the state you pay income tax in has the best incentives for you. Do your research before deciding on which state.
* My state 529 plan does not allow you to withdraw from the plan for the first 18 months, check to see when you can withdraw.
* I do not plan on using this money for a while so I can let the plan compound and the tax deferral compound (My plan is until I get to my lifetime student loan withdraw limit or whatever funds match the remainder of IDR plan, whichever comes first)
* The plans are invested in the stock market so you can lose money if the stock market does not do well. This is a gamble. Based on my state income, I can afford to lose approximately 5% in the market and still break even. [On average the stock market returns 10% but this is over a period of 10 years](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/average-stock-market-return/) and doubles your investment every 7 years.

* The student loan interest paid for by a 529 payment cannot be used as a tax write off. 
* Student loans are now a political issue and who is to say what regulations we have a year from now, let alone 10 years from now. All in all, this is a bureaucratic gamble, but that is why a lot of us did not privatize our loans and stayed with fed loans in the first place.

t3_fzvwny,StudentLoans,Need help deciding which loan is optimal,"Hi all,

Im currently a dental student who's managed to pay the first 2 years of school with money that I saved up. Now, I need to get a loan of $100,000 to cover the final two years.

Can anyone advise me on what the best option is?

t3_fztdxm,StudentLoans,"Last Year of College, How Do I Save the Most Money? [Advice]","Looking for any and all advice. Obviously I can't go back in time and change how I approached college,  I can only move forward, finish my degree and then start paying these loans back. So here's a quick run down of my story so far. I attend a four year university, and will have to go this fall for a 5th year due to my major. In merit scholarships over the 4 years I saved $11,000. However, these scholarships will not renew next year as they only cover four years. 

Next, my school on average with cost of living included is \~$21,000 a year. So even just going off of that average that after this 5th year I'll be $105,000 in debt.

All loans are my responsibility, so please don't reply below that Parent PLUS loans are not mine to worry about, because they are in my case and that was the deal I made with my parents. 

In my geographical area graduates in my major make an average $50,000 so that is a little comforting knowing I will be able to attack these loans when the time comes. This summer I will also have an internship that I should be able to make \~5,500 and don't know what I should use it for. Paying off the current interest on my loans? Tuition? Housing costs so I don't need to take out the full amount on my loan? Keep it in savings? 

Realizing how much debt this is I'm looking for ways to reduce this, or other ways I can save and cut corners or costs through this next year to try and get on top or ahead in tackling these. As well as after graduating. Currently I'm looking for lower rent apartments and also filling out scholarship applications. Also thinking I need to get an on campus job this upcoming year.

t3_fz8d0b,StudentLoans,Y’all. I’m 75% done.,"Good lord guys. I am so psyched. I just made a big payment towards my student loans. My current balance is $15,000. I graduated just last May from a masters program with $60,000 in debt... $45,000 paid over 10 months...

Over the last year I’ve distanced myself from so many simple pleasures. I haven’t eaten out in a year. I haven’t gone to the theater or even rented a movie. I have paused my seeking relationships. I haven’t taken a single day of PTO so that I can accrue/cashout. I budget every damn penny I earn.

It’s been an immensely sacrificial year and I am psyched that it is coming to and end soon. I believe I’ll be able to pay down my balance to at least $11,000 by the end of the month, but with the tax provisions in the CARES I might even be able to further push that figure to $9,000. 

At my current rate, I can be done by my 24th birthday in July. Good god. 24 and debt free. I am drooling at the mouth with excitement for what comes next.

Okay, rant over.","Y’all. I’m 75% done.Good lord guys. I am so psyched. I just made a big payment towards my student loans. My current balance is $15,000. I graduated just last May from a masters program with $60,000 in debt... $45,000 paid over 10 months...

Over the last year I’ve distanced myself from so many simple pleasures. I haven’t eaten out in a year. I haven’t gone to the theater or even rented a movie. I have paused my seeking relationships. I haven’t taken a single day of PTO so that I can accrue/cashout. I budget every damn penny I earn.

It’s been an immensely sacrificial year and I am psyched that it is coming to and end soon. I believe I’ll be able to pay down my balance to at least $11,000 by the end of the month, but with the tax provisions in the CARES I might even be able to further push that figure to $9,000. 

At my current rate, I can be done by my 24th birthday in July. Good god. 24 and debt free. I am drooling at the mouth with excitement for what comes next.

It’s basically just a prison and people who get sent there have to stay for at least 45 days and have almost no contact with the outside world during their stay.

If I get sent there then best case scenario is I would be able to drop all my courses, which would suck because I have all A’s right now.

t3_fytn1e,StudentLoans,Private vs Federal Loan (PhD),"I was fortunate enough not needing a loan for my undergraduate and graduate degree. I'm starting my PhD this year and will most likely have to take out a loan. I know absolutely nothing about student loans...

t3_fyivzm,StudentLoans,FedLoan's message.,"On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response
to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S.
Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your
federally owned loans that we service for ED.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The
changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan
(Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program
loans. 

If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the
servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

● 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept.
30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

● Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period
March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on
your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in
place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period,
payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward
loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll
need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any
payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the
principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when
the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends.
There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed
on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly
payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of
the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept.
30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not.
To opt out, let us know through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""

● If you change your mind after opting out, you can simply request that your loans be placed in the administrative
forbearance again. Contact us through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""
● If you opt out and become more than 30 days late in making a required monthly payment, we'll place your loans in
the administrative forbearance again.

t3_fyqu4b,StudentLoans,Your student loan will be forgiven,"The Covid situation, in my opinion, appears to be the pin that will pop many bubbles, including the student loan bubble. The 6 month 0% interest forbearance is just the beginning. This is a defining moment in our country's history, similar to the Great Depression. Major secular changes tend to happen not when things are going great, but when things are very bad. Recall that the New Deal, which introduced Social Security and other safety nets, etc happened shortly after the Depression.

Many of you who have been very good citizens trying to pay off your loans as quickly as possible will think this to be unfair. I don't disagree. But when times get desperate, it won't matter. In just four weeks, the US government has printed about **6 Trillion dollars**, mostly to bail out companies that made poor financial decisions (e.g., airlines that spent 96% of their cash flows into share buybacks that enriched senior executives, at the expense of a rainy day fund).

In light of all the money printing, the $1.7T of student loans outstanding seems like a drop in the bucket. The question will increasingly be asked - if we can bail out hedge funds who made poor decisions, why should't we bail out student loan debtors, who (for the most part) didn't engage in any bad faith? Additionally, this would substantially free all those making payments to take that monthly payment and use it to spend on a new car, a house, and other economy goods. It will be increasingly seen as a necessary cost.

What I'm saying is that this is the end of an 80+ year economic cycle, where money is redefined. A great debt jubilee is coming. Billionaire Ray Dalio talks about this, and I would recommend this video if you want to learn more [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

None of this is financial advice. Do what you want with your money. But in 5-10 years, you may look back on this post and wonder if anyone could have seen this coming. If you pay attention to the macro world, it's fairly clear how this all ends. Hedge accordingly.

Good luck.","Your student loan will be forgivenThe Covid situation, in my opinion, appears to be the pin that will pop many bubbles, including the student loan bubble.

Billionaire Ray Dalio talks about this, and I would recommend this video if you want to learn more [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

None of this is financial advice. Do what you want with your money. But in 5-10 years, you may look back on this post and wonder if anyone could have seen this coming. If you pay attention to the macro world, it's fairly clear how this all ends. Hedge accordingly.

t3_fxqwax,StudentLoans,FedLoan put my loans into forbearance automatically,"I was under the impression you had to call for your loans to be out into forbearance for COVID-19. I checked and mine were automatically put into forbearance shortly after the 0% interest was put into place. I called them and they are making the request to take them out of forbearance because I want to keep making payments since I’m doing PSLF.

My payment due date is the 10th every month and they said it would take a few days for the forbearance to be lifted. If I make a manual payment will that still count towards my PSLF if they are still in forbearance?

t3_fy6gr6,StudentLoans,"NAVIENT, help!","My loans are with Navient. I graduated about a year and a half ago. I’m kinda new to how paying off loans work and my parents don’t necessarily understand bc they’ve never had to do it! (I’m a first-gen). 

I’ve been making regular on-time payments since graduating. And I briefly went into deferment at the end of the year and was scheduled to start making payments again this month today (4/9/20) . But, then Covid hit and my loans went into automatic forbearance. I’m fortunate enough to still be working during this time, So with the 0% interest thought it’d be a good idea to take advantage and start directly hitting the principle. (After paying all the accrued interest on my loans, ofc) 

I decided to make a overpayment on either the 25th or 26th, that was almost double what I typically pay to attack all my interest. I allocated the amount for each loan by adding the amount of interest owed to the monthly payment amount for every single one. For example, if my monthly payment for loan A was $25.50 and my interest on loan A was $30.50 in total I specified a payment of $56.

All the interest that was on my sub loans was paid off from me doing this but the interest on my unsub loans is still there. So I’m confused and Im scared that I did something wrong lol or that it will hurt me in the long run more than help and tbh, don’t know if what I did was a smart decision. It sounded good in my head at the time.

Thoughts? Or any general advice on what I should do now moving forward?

t3_fxv4h9,StudentLoans,"Student loans, CARES act, and the opt-out forbearance: pay attention to capitalization!","As anticipated after passage of the CARES act, I received an e-mail from Great Lakes this morning notifying me that my federal student loans have been placed into administrative forbearance until Sep. 30th and that I am accruing 0% interest. I have about $7k in outstanding interest from pre-March 13th when the rates went to 0%. Their e-mail includes the following statement:

&gt;If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance.

This is misleading. I called this morning and specifically asked whether or not my existing interest balance would capitalize, and Great Lakes verified that **it will capitalize when the forbearance ends.**

I told the representative that I spoke with that I feel like the statement in the e-mail is misleading and Great Lakes may be opening themselves up to liability. Waiting to see if that makes it to their legal department and if we'll be getting an updated e-mail.

Also note that I have heard from friends, anecdotally, that their providers have told them that their interest will NOT capitalize. If you are affected by this automatic forbearance, you should check with your provider to see what's happening with your existing interest.

If you plan to utilize the PSLF, this is probably a moot point since you only need to make ten years of income-driven payments and then the principal and any outstanding interest is forgiven. Capitalized interest will not affect your monthly payments. However, although I am in a career that makes me theoretically eligible for PSLF, I am personally worried that a future administration could eliminate the program. Because of that, I do not want my interest to capitalize and I opted out of the forbearance as I have the ability to pay.

t3_fxwq4g,StudentLoans,CARES Act and when being responsible screws you a little bit.,"So there seems to have been (continues to be?) confusion on the retroactive period from when the CARES act was signed in and March 13th date. From what I understand, any payments between 3/13 and 3/25 can be refunded without hassle. That makes sense. However, I had also read a few places that *supposedly* if you made a payment early, but your due date was during the retroactive period, you can still get a refund. This was my case. Payment wasn't due until the 15th. I made that payment on the 9th simply because of the way my paycheck falls. I contacted Great Lakes and the rep said yes, this would still apply. Cool, I thought. Was put on hold while she ""processed"" the refund. Then, she got back on the line and said that it was not eligible because the payment had to have been *made* between 3/13 and 3/25. So FM because I was responsible, I guess. That money sure would be helpful right about now.","CARES Act and when being responsible screws you a little bit.So there seems to have been (continues to be?) confusion on the retroactive period from when the CARES act was signed in and March 13th date.

t3_fxzwud,StudentLoans,Student debt “settlement” through lawyer?,"I have $33,000 in private student loan debt. I have enough saved up to pay it, however, it is a lot of money and I would like to still have something in the bank.

My issue is that in order to do this, the account can not be current and I must stop making payments on it for 3-6 months. I am not sure how I feel about this.

t3_fxdlnd,StudentLoans,90k in student loans.,"Hi everyone,

I just got admitted into a nursing school. However, it is very expensive with tuition being 60k for the whole program and 15k worth of housing for the 16 months id be in school. Additionally, I need money to live so I was thinking of living off of 800$ a month so about 13k for the 16 months. This means i would need about 90k worth of loans. I understand this is a crazy high amount, but i would graduate a semester earlier than planned because it is an accelerated program, it has a 100% NCLEX pass rate which is VERY good and the location of the school works perfect for me since my cousin goes to school in the same city so my family and I go often to visit him so I know the city well. Starting pay for nurses in Texas is 60-70k depending on the city.

My plan is to come back home, work for a year and pay  back my loans aggressively and once that year is over I would want to do travel nursing since travel nurses can get paid anywhere from 2-5k a week with housing included. I would like to add I would have my BSN by 21 so I am still very young which is why I would not mind going in debt since I do not have any personal expenses other than tuition and rent and personal expenses. My phone and car bills are paid by my family.  Would you guys go for it? Has anyone taken out a high amount of loans for nursing school? Thank you!","90k in student loans.Hi everyone,

t3_fxvb81,StudentLoans,Navient math just plain wrong on loan repayment details?,"I got an email from Navient that some student loans have been affected by the recent Covid-19 related legislation, so I logged into to check my loan.  I've been on autopay ($196.32/mo) for a long time and log in periodically, but I've never looked at the math closely.

Here are the details.  I have two loans consolidated into one monthly payment.

Here's what my account details page has:

* Loan 1: FFELP - Consolidated
* Balance: $5991.85
* Interest Rate: 4.0%
*Monthly Payment: $144.08
* Term: 72 months (3/2026 last payment)
* Total Amount Paid: $10,373.76


* Loan 2: FFELP - Consolidated
* Balance: $2171.18
* Interest Rate: 4.0%
* Monthly Payment: $52.24
* Term: 72 months (3/2026 last payment)
* Total Amount Paid: $3761.28

If you use the balance/term/interest for Loan #1, it comes out to a monthly payment of $93/mo (not $144).  If you do the same for Loan #1, it comes out to $33.98/mo (not $52).  So in theory, I should be paying ($93+$34) $127/mo instead of $196.  This would also make my total amount paid over the 72 months go from $14135.04 to $9197.28, saving me almost $5000!

I called Navient and the service rep was unable to explain to me why the math wasn't adding up.  She said that she could put in a request to have a calculation explanation physically mailed to me, but I'm not sure how quickly that request will happen, or what reasonable explanation they could possibly have.

What's going on here?  Are there extra amounts I'm paying that aren't shown?  Is the interest rate not really accurate?  I'm at a loss, and just would like to know if anyone else has any experience with anything like this.  I'm financially OK with the $196/mo payment, so my thought is that I should keep that payment and just be done with the loan much quicker than 6 years (just under 4 years!), or I could keep the lower monthly payment and save myself $70/month.

t3_fxclgb,StudentLoans,When do my student loans hit my credit report?,"Hello All,

I graduated back in December and my deferment period for my federal loans end in mid-June. My wife and I are in the process of having a house built. My issue is that our mortgage lender will be running our credit in July to lock in the interest rate. My credit score is excellent, and I fear that it will drop significantly once the loans go into a repayment status.

My loans appear on my credit report, but they have zero effect because of my deferred status.

I called Mohela to see if I can defer another 6 months and they said that I have to wait for a bill to come in the mail and then they can evaluate my options.

   
 

To sum up, my loans ($19,000) go into a repayment status on June 14th. 

How soon after June 14th does my credit report show this change?

Will my credit score drop much?

t3_fxi5cb,StudentLoans,Best option for funding accelerated nursing program?,"My daughter will graduate from a major state university in May with a BS in HDFS and roughly $20k in federal student loans, the rest having been paid in cash by her mother and I.

Upon graduation she will be rolling directly into the fifteen month accelerated nursing program at the same university, at a cost of roughly $35k. This will be paid entirely by her, as we will be starting to pay for her younger sibling in the fall.

The federal aid package is fairly dismal, only $6k in unsubsidized loans offered. Frankly I’m surprised that with a sibling entering college she would not qualify to borrow the full cost of the tuition. The program is not graduate level so she does not qualify for grad plus. Also should mention that apparently there will be no federal aid available for the summer term because the program only schedules 11 credit hours.

It seems like our only option is to find a private loan and I will have to cosign, which I would do but am not really thrilled about. Am I missing anything here, and if not - can anyone recommend a private lender for this situation?

t3_fwxp39,StudentLoans,Ways to get Fedloan to remove Late Payments,"Hi- 

I posted this to Personal Finance but figured this might be a good forum to get help. Sooooo rewind a few years I graduated from a very expensive private university a little over two years ago. I was unaware of how important credit is and repaying loans were. I made some money from my first real job- thought I was going to be able to not pay the piper and simply dug my head in the sand with respect to my student loans (private university loan and FedLoan loan(s)). 

  
After pulling my head out of my ass and trying to be financially responsible and being tired of dodging Fedloan and my school loans. I finally picked up and decided to confront my responsibilities. Literally nine months ago I entered student loan rehabilitation with my **university** and made accelerated payments to bring my account current. In doing this, my credit score shot up from 502 to 570, still waiting on Equifax to update their records as well...but should be in the same ballpark at TransUnion.  While I was rehabbing my student loans through my university, I brought my FedLoan current but having 2 missed payments amongst 13 loans equated to 26 late payments tanking my score in the first place (my fault...I get it). 

  
So now that my university credit report is golden, I've been trying to tackle my on-time FedLoan account and trying to either come up with a solution where they could remove my 26 lates from my credit report- making it seem as if they were never there. I've read about requesting a retroactive forbearance and also a Goodwill Letter to request to remove my late payments. Does anyone have any advice on how to get my lates removed with FedLoan?   


I understand that achieving a great credit score is a marathon, not a sprint- but I am trying and have made responsible decisions to get back on track!

t3_fwk8ch,StudentLoans,Fedloan forbearance confusion regarding PSLF.,"So fedloan emailed me today to say that my federal loans all have zero interest and are automatically placed in forbearance until September.  That’s fine, but I’d rather be making payments because I’m on PSLF and want to get this stuff done as soon as possible.  

But I’m confused by one paragraph from the notice:

t3_fwll8z,StudentLoans,Sallie Mae: Late Payment Help,"(Throwaway account)

Guys, I have a loan with Sallie Mae and I just sent in my payment of $253 that was due on the 3rd of April. But when I checked, it didn't say anything about late fees, it only doubled my amount due to $507 and said my payment was past due. I'm so confused because from what the contract states, late fees are supposed to be 5% of what was past due. Now they're saying I now owe $507? 

I'm hoping it's because they added next month's payment but the fact that it's saying the $507 is the ""Total Amount Due"" is making me think otherwise.

Is this an error? Should I just pay the other $258 accrued interest now?

I'm freaking out because my parents have access to my bank account. They're going to see I didn't make a payment and I'm gonna get drilled for sure.","Sallie Mae: Late Payment Help(Throwaway account)

t3_fvk73u,StudentLoans,Mission: Complete. I finished paying my loans!,"I finished undergrad with a loan balance that totaled about $8500. (My mother told me she would pay for undergrad, then I graduated and learned that she took loans in my name. She then said she would pay them back and didn't.) Most of the loan debt is debt I took in my own name, however. The short story is that I borrowed a shit load of money at 21 and 22 to pursue a degree (MLIS) with an extremely low ROI because a) I assumed I would always work for a PSLF eligible employer and b) I had no real intention to pay the money back in full. In retrospect, this was an extremely stupid and childish action to take, and it reflected my lack of life experience as much as my ignorance about the real world impact of owing so much money plus interest. 

After I realized my hellish mistake, I got out of the library field, into another related, more lucrative and employable field, paid my way through a second masters program while paying my living expenses, working a full time job in my field, and taking advantage of my in-school deferral to pay down my existing loans. Those years were extremely stressful, and I was pretty broke for all of them. However, the outcomes of those actions were well worth the hassle. When I started the second masters program in January 2016, I had 6 loans outstanding. When I finished in May 2019 (with no additional debt), I had 2. In November of 2018, I got an offer for my current job, for which I moved across country (again) and at which I got a 51% raise from my previous position. I threw all that money into the pit of despair that is Navient and did what I think is a commendable job with not letting lifestyle creep occur. Last Monday, March 30th, the final payment of $307.40 hit my account. I am now paid in full! 

It required a lot of drive and grind to get this done. In addition to always having a full time job, I worked a side job (one foot still in the library world). I have not owned a car in 9 years, and I had room mates for 10.5 years. I don't have any pets or kids, and I consider myself extremely lucky that I don't want either, loan debt or not, because I don't think I could have afforded them. I do not own property, and I have no down payment money saved. I cook all my meals at home, and everything I own is secondhand from either eBay or Goodwill. I churned credit cards to take vacations (including my loan payments, tuition payments, and rent), which were always done on a shoestring budget even considering the reduced cost, and I sold back PTO when I was able. This sub was a huge source of motivation, as were several people in my offline life. Hell of a time to complete the mission, but nonetheless I'm thrilled that it's FINALLY OVER.

Lastly, I downloaded the transaction history for my account but am not emotionally ready to see how much I paid including interest. The total principal of all my seven loans was $57,876. All of them were federal, and the interest rates were: 7.9% (Grad PLUS x1), 6.8% (x5), and 5.6% (x1).","Mission: Complete.

t3_fvwdr2,StudentLoans,From Navient,"On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your federally owned loans that we service for ED. 

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 

First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020. 

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program loans. If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options. 

We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

• 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

• Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO 

Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends. 

There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept. 30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not. 

To opt out, let us know through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""

• If you change your mind after opting out, you can simply request that your loans be placed in the administrative forbearance again. Contact us through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US."" 

• If you opt out and become more than 30 days late in making a required monthly payment, we'll place your loans in the administrative forbearance again.

HOW TO CONTACT US

The most cost efficient thing for me to do would be to just throw that 3k into the abyss that is my private loans, but on the other hand I could increase my cash flow by paying off one of my 4.4% fedloans, and getting very close to paying off the next smallest fedloan.

t3_fw1njl,StudentLoans,How would you handle the CARES act with my debts?,"Hi everyone,
I’m just curious what my plan of attack should be for my loan situation. I graduated in 2018 with ~98k and have gotten it down to 72k (70 in federal subsidized/unsubsidized, 2k in private)

My payment for the 72k (there’s like 11 loans so I won’t list them all but they range from 3.4-5.7%) is low because I was focusing on paying off other things and trying to pay off my private loan. Since the CARES act is 0% interest, should I take the money I am using on federal loans and put it towards the private loan(interest is 6.1%), or should I keep making my federal payments and let it payoff some of the principal? Mathematically, I guess using the money towards my private loan makes more sense but I guess I’m just looking for confirmation from others to see if it’s a good idea. I feel like I’m missing out on some benefits if I don’t keep paying my federal loans.","How would you handle the CARES act with my debts?Hi everyone,

t3_fweeg0,StudentLoans,America's student debt 'crises',"I saw a post on Reddit that got a lot of up votes about cancelling doctors student debt, not the first I've seen but the most 'wtf' ones I've seen since from Google, doctors earn 3 times more than their Australian counterparts so $350k in debt for a $300k a year salary is nothing. What's this idea with cancelling student debt?

For context, I live in Australia, I went to uni and I'm in debt. I decided to take that on and when looking at further study, I looked at what wouldn't give me crazy amounts of debt. Hardly anyone here I've met cries for debt cancellation because we bought it on ourselves. But Australia has a system where we don't have to pay it back until we earn a certain amount which I thought America didn't have but when I asked on Reddit, someone told me the Government does have a debt system? I understand that everyone is not on this system but wouldn't a better idea to just be take on everyone's loans and do the same thing Australia does? The average American has 30k in student debt, I'd say it's similar to Australia, I'm going to be 44k in debt that I'll be paying for years. The thing is, if you did CS or medicine or engineering, even if your debt is higher than Australia, they make waaaay more than they do here. You can start of in silicon valley with 200k+ per year, that's like someone hitting their peak here.

Can someone help with my confusion? I just don't see the need to 'cancel' student debt, maybe some refinancing but that's about it which from what I've seen is/has being done. I could rack up 100k in student debt too but then asking for it to be payed off just...doesn't sound right","America's student debt 'crises'I saw a post on Reddit that got a lot of up votes about cancelling doctors student debt, not the first I've seen but the most 'wtf' ones I've seen since from Google, doctors earn 3 times more than their Australian counterparts so $350k in debt for a $300k a year salary is nothing.

t3_fvo6x1,StudentLoans,Should I spend all my savings on going to college?,"Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college *and* to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually **not** a very good thing?

My boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me *before* I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to &lt;$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I *recieved* it in the year which would affect my aid.  

My feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.

• I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.

It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, *and* emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.

t3_fvk3ms,StudentLoans,Is it better to pay off Great Lakes and Heartland as early as possible?,"Hello everyone, I have been getting mixed answers for my situation, so I thought I should give this subreddit a try.

Just to give a little background, I have some debt for Great Lakes Loans and Heartland. I have been paying monthly since his January. I could be out of debt, but some people were saying I should pay monthly because it's good for my credit score and tax. With the CARES act, Great Lakes Loan's interest rate is 0% until September. 

My question is, would it be a better idea to pay monthly until this September and pay the rest of the debt off for Great Lakes Loans? And pay off Heartland loans whenever I can?

Thanks ahead of time. Stay safe everyone!","Is it better to pay off Great Lakes and Heartland as early as possible?Hello everyone, I have been getting mixed answers for my situation, so I thought I should give this subreddit a try.

t3_fus878,StudentLoans,Updated guidance for defaulted FFEL loans - COVID,"I'll update the stickied post too but for visability I wanted to create a new one.

The ED issued a new announcement around 2 AM.  Most of it applies to schools but what they did do is give the non-federally held FFEL holders of defaulted loans guidance to cease all collections until 9/30 - just like they did for the federally held loans.  The announcement is long and as I said most applies to schools so here's the relevant FFEL parts

FFEL Program: Lenders and Guaranty Agencies and Loans held by the Department Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements (§ 682.200(b))
The FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of six consecutive, on-time voluntary full monthly payments required to re-establish his or her eligibility for assistance under Title IV of the HEA.

A FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment a borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of three consecutive, on-time voluntary full monthly payments required to establish eligibility to consolidate a defaulted loan.

Borrowers in In-School Loan Status (§ 682.209(a)) and In-School Deferment Status (§ 682.210)
The loan holder should continue to report to NSLDS as “in-school” the loan status of each borrower who was in an “in-school” status on the date the borrower’s attendance at the institution was interrupted due to the COVID-19 national emergency. The loan holder should continue the borrower in that loan status until the institution reports the borrower as withdrawn.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (§ 682.410)
Guaranty agencies must stop collection activities on defaulted loans until September 30, 2020, on all federally held loans. Collection activities must resume at the end of the period at the point at which they were discontinued. The guaranty agency must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Payments to Rehabilitate Defaulted Loans (§ 682.405)
The FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment the borrower fails to make as an interruption in the nine on-time voluntary full monthly payments within ten months for purposes of rehabilitating the defaulted loan.

EDIT - there was another notice that came out early morning - it gives the non-federally held Perkins and FFEL holders the OPTION of offering 0% interest and the cessation of payments for six months mirroring the federally held loans.  The notice instructs borrowers to contact their schools (for perkins) and loan holders (for non defaulted, non federally held FFEL) for more info.  I am hearing chatter that at least one FFEL lender is considering doing the 0% interest but we'll have to see.","Updated guidance for defaulted FFEL loans - COVIDI'll update the stickied post too but for visability I wanted to create a new one.

t3_fv84bj,StudentLoans,Insights/opinions needed on repaying my loans ?," Hey guys,   
 

I got a job this year and planning to start paying back my undergrad/grad school loans.  I have \~68k in Stafford loans (where 3k is accrued interest and 65k is principal. I also have \~13k in Graduate Plus loans (where 1k is accrued interest and 12k is principal).   
 

Which one should I start paying first ? I am reading on the great lakes website, that they apply that payment to the highest interest loans first. Is that automatic or do I have to choose that option ?   
 

I am planning to set up automatic payments of 1k every month and maybe pay extra if I get more money from side jobs/tax refunds/family donations and such. Can I do that?   
 Also my company throws about 5k for free at my 401k at the end of April alongside my own personal contribution and their matching ( so I total about 7-8k every year of 401k money). Is it a good idea to take that money out from the 401k (and pay the penalty from withdrawing it ) and apply that amount towards my loans or no ? Is that a recommended strategy ?   
 

Also I keep getting this tuition refinance letters in my mailbox from Sallie Mae and some other companies. Seems like interest rates are lower compared to the original lender. Should I switch to any of them ? What are some upsides and downsides of switching to Sallie Mare or the likes of it?   
 

From your own personal experience, what is a good way to pay student loans ? What strategy did you follow?   
 

I would love your insights and opinions.

t3_fv07fa,StudentLoans,CARES- Employer Student Loan Payment,"I searched for this topic and saw a few posts mentioning it, but not really much information-

I work for a small business. My employer recently mentioned that he had read the CARES Act includes a tax break for employers who pay student loans for their employees (up to ~$5000). I told him I had read that too (but didn’t think my company would go for it). He told me to look into it and research the benefits to the company and to myself.

First off, I pay like $12000 in student loans per year, so this would only cover part of it. Also, when doing my taxes this year, I did get some money back in the interest paid. 

He indicated that the employer would pay me a lower salary if we were to start this benefit. I already get paid a pretty low salary.

I guess I’m just wondering if this would really make a difference for me and if anyone has any experience with employer payment of student loans generally or even any experience with this new law and whether it is difficult for employers to set up.

t3_fv2wdl,StudentLoans,"Fiance currently on PAYE plan for $55,000 in loans. I am debt free with good income, hoping to knock out debt in the most efficient way possible.","Some background:

Current loan: 55K

Loan forgiveness date: 2032 (8/20 years so far)

Current monthly payment: $350 

We can afford to spend more money on the loan, but am unsure if we should keep the PAYE plan and pay more every month or change to the standard plan. Changing to the standard plan would likely increase the monthly payment significantly as well as incur some interest capitalization. 

 I tried using the calculator below, but the numbers didn't make sense or factor in how long my fiance has been in repayment. If I could figure out what a real monthly payment under standard plan, this would maybe be more straightforward. 

[https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator/r)

Options I see:

1. Keep PAYE, file taxes separately (probably better), pay as much as we can afford. Do this for 12 more years and pay the balance down so the taxes when loan is forgiven are minimal.
2. Switch to Standard plan and pay that amount if we're able to 

Should point out we have around 17K in credit cards we will pay off within a year prioritized above the student loan.

Anyone have any advice on the two options pros/cons? Anything I'm missing&gt; Thanks in advance.","Fiance currently on PAYE plan for $55,000 in loans. I am debt free with good income, hoping to knock out debt in the most efficient way possible.Some background:

t3_fus9tg,StudentLoans,New guidance issued for Perkins - COVID,"In the late night April 4th guidance, the ED also provided for some relief for non-federally held Perkins loans.  It is as follows:

Federal Perkins Loan Program

Borrowers in Repayment (§ 674.33)
The Department authorizes institutions to grant forbearance, for a period not to exceed three months, to a Federal Perkins Loan borrower who is in repayment and who is unable to make payments due to a COVID-19 related interruption.

For an institutionally held Perkins Loan, interest accrues during any period of forbearance. A borrower may request this forbearance orally or in writing and is not required to submit documentation to be considered eligible for this forbearance. An institution must document the forbearance in the borrower’s file. To receive forbearance beyond the three-month period, the borrower must make a request to the institution and provide supporting documentation. (At the expiration of the three-month period, the institution should examine the borrower’s situation to determine potential eligibility for an economic hardship deferment or unemployment deferment, as appropriate.) This period of forbearance is counted toward the three-year maximum limit on the number of years of forbearance that may be granted to a borrower.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (Part 674, Subpart C—Due Diligence)
The institution may stop collection activities through September 30, 2020 upon notification by the borrower, a member of the borrower’s family, or another reliable source that the borrower has been affected by the COVID-19 national emergency. Collection activities must resume when the period ends. The institution must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements on Defaulted Loans (§ 674.2)
An institution should not treat any scheduled payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of six on-time, consecutive, monthly payments required for the borrower to make satisfactory repayment arrangements on a defaulted Perkins Loan and to re-establish their eligibility for assistance under Title IV of the HEA. If the Department does not extend the effective period for the temporary relief provided by this guidance, the required sequence of qualifying payments resumes at the point at which it was discontinued.

Payments to Rehabilitate Defaulted Loans (§ 674.39)
An institution should not treat any scheduled payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of nine on-time, consecutive, monthly payments required for the borrower to rehabilitate the defaulted loan. If the Department does not extend the effective period for the temporary relief provided by this guidance, the required sequence of qualifying payments resumes at the point at which it was discontinued.","New guidance issued for Perkins - COVIDIn the late night April 4th guidance, the ED also provided for some relief for non-federally held Perkins loans.

t3_fuw3u5,StudentLoans,600k Student Loan Question,"Hi All!

I'm graduating from dental school and the student debt is unfortunately racked me up to $600,000 at an average interest rate of 6.5% (Very daunting I know). I feel like REPAYE is my only option at this point, given the sizable debt that I'm in. I have a relatively good understanding of it, but I'm not understanding how the governmental interest subsidy plays into forgiveness after 25 years.

From what I understand, the government subsidizes 50-100% of accrued interest on monthly payments for the time you are making REPAYE programs. But if the loan is not entirely paid for after 25 years and the loan is subsequently forgiven, are those 25 years of government-subsidized interest payments then tacked back onto the “income received” thereby making you responsible for the remaining balance AND 25 years of interest payment?

t3_fudvti,StudentLoans,We made our last student loan payment(!) - now what?,"Pretty stoked about this - just made our final payment last week. Since the payment went through at the beginning of this week the account shows a negative $15 balance and we've been locked out of a lot of features (like looking at payment history, changing payment info, etc).

So now we're expecting a $15 check in the mail and a letter confirming our loan is paid off. Is that correct? How long should we wait before getting in touch with FedLoan? Should we expect to hear from them by the end of April? I know we're living in weird times but I'm wondering, ballpark, whether this is a 15 day wait or a 90 day wait.

(Paying off the loan is a relief but I feel like I won't truly breathe easy until we get a letter stating we're all finished and the account can be closed out)","We made our last student loan payment(!) - now what?Pretty stoked about this - just made our final payment last week.

t3_fuhu2j,StudentLoans,My prospective student loan debt has me unable to decide where to go to college,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or if my posting will help me at all, but I feel like I just needed to write out what I'm going through right now.

I'm making this post today because I'm currently a senior in high school whose having a difficult time picking a college due to financial reasons. Here is some key information about my situation:

* I come from a pretty low income family (only my dad works and he makes around \~40k a year)
* I will have to pay for all of my net costs for college through private and federal loans
* I want to major in business, specifically Marketing, and my dream is to work in the fashion industry
* I think? I want to eventually go back to school for my MBA

I currently have three options for schools: School A is my cheapest option (in-state school), and my net cost is around $10,000 a year. School B is my most expensive option at $37,000 a year. I have not received my financial aid package from School C yet, but I predict my costs will be about $30,000 a year.

At first glance, the answer seems obvious: School A. However, I was rejected from business and only accepted for general studies. It's notoriously difficult to transfer into the major you want, especially business. In order to be a competitive applicant, I'd have to get a near perfect GPA, be involved in 3 organizations, hold a leadership position, and take on an internship during a break, all while also doing my work study. As much as I'd like to believe that anything is possible with hard work, I can't help but think that I'm going to fail. I don't even know what else I'd want to do if I didn't get in. School A also has basically no relation to fashion, so I feel like I'd be giving up on my dream. I think if I went here, I would just be absolutely miserable.

On the other hand, School B accepted me directly into their business school (a top ten 10 business school). I was also admitted to their honors college, as well as receiving benefits as a scholarship recipient. I've visited and loved the business program, and they even have an apparel merchandising minor I'd love to take. Additionally, even if fashion doesn't work out for me, I think a degree from this school would provide the best job prospects in other industries. However, even with a scholarship, I'm looking at almost $150,000 in loans by the time I'd graduate. All my friends have told me that School B seems like the best option, but I feel like they don't understand what the burden of such debt truly entails.

Lastly, School C is probably my dream school. It's located in New York City, so I think that it would give me the best chance at making it in the fashion industry. They have a ton of organizations that sound really interesting to me, so I could see myself getting really involved and growing my passion. I'm also not a huge fan of big school culture (like tailgates, games, rushing, etc.), so I think School C would be ideal. However, job security seems less stable as its such a specialized school, and living expenses would be extremely high. After graduation, I'd probably be around $120,000 in debt.

I'm going to call School B's financial aid office soon to see if they can offer me more aid, but I'm not counting on it. I'm also trying to find outside scholarships, but I don't know how much that is going to help either. I'm just completely devastated right now, and I feel like I'm stuck in a trap. Everyday I've been thinking of everything I regret. I should've applied for Questbridge, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I should've applied to more safeties, but I thought School A would take me for sure. I should've applied to private universities that give good aid, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I wish I could redo my senior year. I think I know that the best thing to do would be going to School A, but I just can't bring myself to accept it.

If anyone has read this far, thank you for listening, and any advice would be greatly appreciated because I am so lost.","My prospective student loan debt has me unable to decide where to go to collegeHello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or if my posting will help me at all, but I feel like I just needed to write out what I'm going through right now.

t3_fug59y,StudentLoans,"CARES act, unpaid interest, automatic forbearance --&gt; capitalization after 6 months?","CARES act introduced and backdated to 3/13/20 to help borrowers for student loan debt relief. My take on it is that  all borrowers will have automatic forbearance x6 months. 0% interest during this time.

Great right? But doesn't end of forbearance typically trigger capitalization?

Example: Some of us have principal (let's say 100k for this example) and unpaid interest (let's say 33k)

100k (principal) + 33k (unpaid interest)

\-------&gt; x6 months of 0% interest (from 3/13/20)

At the end of the forbearance (\~9/13/20) if capitalization were to occur:

the loan becomes 133k (new principal) which derives interest from a higher principal (the 33k of interest now starts accumulating more interest).

Seems very unfair if forbearance is mandatory if this does trigger a capitalization event.

t3_fuizss,StudentLoans,"If you have only a little bit of student loans, is it better to pay off student loans or get forgiveness after 20 years?","By the time I graduate, I'll have between 15k to 30k dollars in direct federal loans.

I expect to have a salary after school of about 60k, and to have a salary of 100k to 120k a decade later.

It seems as if my discretionary income after taxes at the higher end would be 80k with 8k of that going towards the loan

So I doubt that the debt would even last the 20 years needed for forgiveness.

I don't know whether to plan on paying it back fully or to plan on paying minimum payments and getting it forgiven.

If it's better to bank on forgiveness then I'll borrow as many direct loans as I can but otherwise I'll do whatever I can to avoid taking loans.

I have other loans that can't be forgiven and was just wondering if there was a way to make those loans easier to pay by having my student loans forgiven.

t3_ftxr5a,StudentLoans,PAYE vs REPAYE,"So, I know this has been beaten to death in some ways, but I was curious for some input on my situation. I feel I have a reasonable grasp of both plans. I'm a graduating medical student and my spouse has no debt.

Due to the size of my loans, we have to pursue an income-based plan since standard repayment plans are beyond our capacity during residency. 

**The debt:** 255k at 6.3%, all federal loans. 

**My debt priority**: pay a doable amount during residency (5 years) but then pay it off quickly (2-3 years) as an attending with the ultimate goal to pay my entire loan amount. I will still do PSLF paperwork (as I will be at a non-profit hospital) but won't necessarily count on that happening. 

My wife intends to keep working and most advice that I am reading says to go with PAYE due to the ability to file taxes separately and then only make payments based on my salary. This effectively would lower the monthly payments. 

Alternatively, REPAYE would count our combined income no matter our filing status and therefore have higher monthly payments -- but still have the benefit of interest assistance. 

**All that said -- and help correct me if I am missing something -- since I intend to pay off the debt and** ***not*** **pursue debt forgiveness then is there any reason that I** ***shouldn't*** **pursue REPAYE?

t3_ftvnh3,StudentLoans,Got a federal loan refund and not sure what to do with it?,"Hi Reddit!

(I’m posting on mobile- sorry for any formatting issues) 

I’m in a bit of a predicament. I’m a college senior and like many other college students, I was sent home in March due to COVID-19. My school altered our tuition/room and board bill to reflect this change. 

Because of this, I got a loan refund of approx $2500. This refund was from my federal loans (subsidized and unsubsidized). I have approx. $52k in student loans (oof) outside of this. These loans are federal and institutional aid through my school. The federal ones will start to be due in November. The institutional loans aren’t due until June 2021. I haven’t graduated yet so I’m not sure what my monthly payment(s) will be. 

My question for this subreddit is: what do I do with this money? Should I pay it all in one chunk towards my federal loans the second I can, since that’s where they came from? Or should I split it over time into my monthly payments once they begin to take pressure off of myself? How can I avoid paying the most interest in the long run??

The loans I am being refunded are as follows: 
Federal Direct Subsidized Loan: $1,815
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: $659

Sorry if this was confusing at all- I’m still learning about all of this and navigating the “real” world!

t3_ftn1za,StudentLoans,Federal Loans vs Sallie Mae?,"Hi all,

I’m attending law school in the fall and am trying to decide the best place to take out a student loan. I filled out my FAFSA and was offered student loans through the university with an interest rate of about ~6%, however i believe i would be able to get a lower fixed rate through Sallie Mae. Every article I’ve read says to always take federal loans before thinking about a private lender, but if I can get a lower rate w Sallie Mae, why wouldn’t I go with them? Are there some pros/cons I’m not aware of?

t3_ftq6sk,StudentLoans,Invest in Roth IRA or double down on student loans during COVID-19 crisis?,"Hello reddit, this is my first post but I haven’t been able to find sound advice on this topic so I wanted to throw it out there for all of the personal finance folks out there. 

I’m 23 years old for context. I have a full time job (for now) making ~$3000 monthly. I have ~$29,000 in student loan debt (all federal) and currently paying $360/month ($30 more than the minimum). Also, I already have $3600 in emergency cash too (which should be enough for 3 months if I were to lose my job). 

I just opened a Roth IRA account (employee doesn’t have a 401k plan) and I can’t decide whether I should go all in on investing in the markets while they are down SO much OR double down on my student loans since it’s 0% interest rate right now bc of COVID-19 and I would be paying only on principal. 

In the long-run, do people think it’s better to:

A. Invest higher percentage of income into Roth IRA (put off student loan payment for this time)
B. Put all of money into student loans instead since it’s all on principal
C. Combo of paying student loan minimum and investing some % of income into Roth IRA.

I’m sure there’s not 1 right answer to this but I wanted to see what people think the best move is during this crazy time.

t3_ftiu5i,StudentLoans,"Not sure if this is actually a loan or just a payment agreement, but I have a question about it","Ok, this may get long and convoluted, so I apologize in advance. A few years ago, my wife decided to go to college to get her Bachelors from a large online private “not for profit” school where the classes are done one at a time in an extremely accelerated manner of approximately one per month. A bit after a year (and having taken a few interspersed months off due to external needs), she reached out to Financial Aid to see why they hadn’t sent her expense disbursement (where they send you money for books etc) as expected. They came back telling her that she wasn’t going to be getting one, because when they looked at her account, she was actually going to be short about $1,000 for her current class, and that she wasn’t eligible for the next loan disbursement until after the next class, which they would require her to pay both the shortage and the next class fee before the first day of class, to the tune of approximately $2500. When she questioned it, she was told her 2 options were to either pay it, or drop out. Nevermind that (at least in our opinion) Fin Aid was responsible for this error, not us. I think it’s completely reasonable to assume that they should be keeping track of the finances to ensure that the student stays in compliance with federal student loan laws. In the end, she ended up having to drop out obviously, since we don’t have that kind of money to burn, and they adjusted things, and said that she owed around $1200 when all was said and done (part of the grants and loans had to be sent back due to enrollment level when recalculated). They kept trying to make her pay the entire amount at once for probably about a year, before they finally “relented” and allowed her to do a payment plan (of $150 a month, they wouldn’t accept anything less). We paid that for about 6 months, and then had to stop because we just couldn’t afford to keep paying. 

My question is this, without them suing her and getting a court order, can they seize our tax refund since it’s not a federally backed loan (again, if it’s really even a loan)?","Not sure if this is actually a loan or just a payment agreement, but I have a question about itOk, this may get long and convoluted, so I apologize in advance.

t3_ft64xk,StudentLoans,Settle student loan during COVID-19,"Hi! Please don’t judge me. I’m looking for advice on how to fix this and my anxiety and guilt is already enough. 

A private loan I took out in 2007 was deferred shortly after graduating in 2008. Long story short: My stepdad had co-signed for it, and I had been sending him payments while I lived/taught abroad, but my mom told me to stop sending him money since he wasn’t paying on the loans and was hoping to file for bankruptcy. Stepdad and I had a huge falling out afterwards. By the time I was back on my feet I wasn’t able to locate where the loan was. 

Recently my estranged stepdad sent a pack of mail and in it was a letter from that student loan (With American Coradius Int’l). They want to settle the debt. Right now it’s at $41,719.07 They offered to settle at 20,880.00 over 24 months. 

I want to pay for it since my stepdad is on the line for it as well. I’m curious if/how Coronavirus has changed the rules of negotiation. I’d rather not drain my savings, but if I could probably settle for half or so of what they’re asking, I might be able to do that while still leaving enough for emergencies. 

Do you think I could offer a full payment for less to get rid of the loan? I’m currently unemployed for the foreseeable future and I live abroad.

t3_ft9hy3,StudentLoans,My partner (American) and I (Canadian) both got emails about our student loans this week,"NSLS emailed to tell me they automatically stopped all Canadian student loan payments with no interest accrued until September (phew!)

In contrast, my partner was just “approved” for is a $224 USD monthly payment increase. It’s still not enough to cover the monthly interest accrued, so the loan just keeps growing. 

She phoned and was (thankfully) told student loan payments are also being held in the US without interest until September, so she won’t have to pay the increase until then. Sadly, she also got news yesterday that she is being laid off from one of her jobs due to COVID-19, so she’s losing a third of her income. It doesn’t look like she’s going to be able to pay the old amount, never mind the new one. I’m hoping they’ll re-evaluate her payments based on her new reduced income. 

Just to clarify, we have the same level of education in the same field (social work) from public institutions, so this wasn’t any kind of extravagant spending on her part. Just an attempt to climb out of poverty via education and do a little good along the way. 

What’s unique about her situation is that she’s a permanent resident in Canada and has lived here for 4 years. We’re wondering if it’s even worth paying the partial interest on her US student loans any more. There’s no hope of ever paying down the principle with our incomes. We don’t want to destroy her credit in the US or have them go after her impoverished mother who co-signed the loans 12 years ago.

My girlfriend and I were supposed to pay rent today. She has loans through Sallie Mae and called a week and a half ago to put them in forbearance because we faced a huge loss of income due to coronavirus.

Not only that, but they sent a letter dated March 27th 2020, and it states that the forbearance was approved for December 2019-January 2020. She wasn’t even paying her loans in December so is this an error?

We’re both not getting any aid from the government for COVID, and now we don’t have enough money to pay rent with the money we did have saved. Both of us are extremely stressed and financially screwed right now.

t3_ft852z,StudentLoans,"Parents think that they can transfer Parent Plus Loans to me, the student.","So it pretty much boils down to this. Recently I've realized that my parents keep mentioning on top of my in progress computer science degree debt totaling up to what looks like 26k-28k over 4 years, that I apparently need to add 8k on top of that estimate. For the past 1.5 years, I don't understand what they were talking about, until I read up on Parent PLUS loans after looking over my billing amount on MOHELA, that they were talking about the PLUS loans. 

I have brought up to my mother that PLUS loans can't be transferred unless it's done through a private lending company, and she is convinced otherwise. I don't intend on accepting a transfer loan when I've never had to go private as a result of my own work, and I didn't necessarily ""earn"" that potential interest rate, since most of my loans are all between 5-7%. 

I'm not sure what to do, since this is going to come to a head at some point. Honestly I feel pretty salty since over the past 4 years, I have slowly started to realize through my personal finance class that my parents did not prepare for my college funding, as my dad wasn't involved in the process and my mother had to figure everything out, and I'd much rather not have to account for this extra 8k, because if my parents had worked together to do a better job of preparing for this, we likely wouldn't be in this scenario in the first place.

EDIT: I seem to have come off much more whiny than I meant  when I originally posted this. The main gripe is the fact that I don't have a say or a discussion, I'm just being told what to do with no prior discussion with my parents, even though this is something that impacts my future finances. 

To be clear, I don't have an issue helping to pay the 8k, but my main concern is that my parents are being dismissive and not actually considering my word when this directly affects me, so I don't know how to approach them with alternatives than just refinancing.","Parents think that they can transfer Parent Plus Loans to me, the student.So it pretty much boils down to this.

t3_fs7pxj,StudentLoans,I work for a Federal Student Loan Servicer. To give you guys an idea.,"It's all pretty chaotic. Here's what we know for a fact. All ***ED*** loan accounts, are eligible for a COVID forbearance to be placed on the account until September. ***ALL*** ED loan accounts will have a 100% interest subsidy that is backdated from 3/13/20 until 9/30/20.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things that have been conveyed to us by FSA. Any and all payments made to student loan accounts ***AFTER*** 3/13/20 will be recalculated by our accounting teams once they backdate the interest to make it look like the payment was made on an account that accrued ***NO*** interest after 3/13/20. Meaning the only interest between your payment and principle balance will be interest from before that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't speak for exact dates, but expect it not to show up for a majority of people until April. Again, it ***WILL*** backdate as of right now. That's been mandated by FSA and unless THEY change it, it will update. However, there are tens of millions of accounts and quite a few of these changes have to be done manually.

Another thing to please keep in mind. FSA only just decided ***HOW*** it wanted this done, for us as servicers, last Friday. So in the midst of trying to get as many call center workers to work from home(which adds it's own troubles. Bad internet, tech problems, tech illiterate people, etc ) their trying to still keep our guys working as smoothly as possible to set this all up. As someone who also has student loans (fedloans/PHEAA) I know how frustrating this type of chaos can be, but please try to understand it's just as chaotic for the other side. Information is updating daily and it's all pretty break-neck speed for people. ***ESPECIALLY*** the call center new-hires who just started before this. I have some who report to me that I've spent hours trying to reinforce to make sure they can smoothly handle this, and it's caused a few to quit from the stress and frustration and tensions this entire thing is bringing.

t3_fsmpmv,StudentLoans,Student Loans Disappeared?,"I know federal student loans don’t disappear really, but damnit if I can’t find them!

Backstory: 18 year ago, I got student loans (Perkins) and was going to college... during that, I knocked up my girlfriend (very stupid, I know!) and I wound up dropping out of college and getting a crap job to support them and marry my girlfriend. My wife didn’t believe in loans or credit (some kind of religious thing) and we rented and paid cash for everything. Then 2 years ago, we got divorced and I signed up to CreditKarma and AnnualCreditReport.com to view my credit, expecting to see all these non-paid student loans... but my credit report was blank! I don’t have credit cards or loans and I don’t default on my utilities or insurance... so I decided to go onto StudentAid.gov and a few other federal sites to try and find the loans... nothing! I entered the FSA username and email address from back then and it said it couldn’t be found. 

I usually owe a few hundred by tax time, so they’ve never tried to garnish any tax returns since I don’t get any... and they’ve never tried to contact me, email me, call me or try and do paycheck garnishments. So i’m really wondering what happened to them and where they went?

I know anything from that long ago wouldn’t be on my credit reports because it was over 7 years ago, but you’d think they would try to find me. 

18 years ago, the balance was $12,000... i’m not sure what it would even amount to now. I want to start paying them off because well, i’m rid of the crazy religious nut and I want to better my future and I don’t like having debt looming out there somewhere. I borrowed it, I owe it and I intend to pay it back.

I will update as soon as things progress but no news does not mean bad news.","Give them some time on the covid stuff folksI get that people are anxious..I really do..bit we need to give the feds and servicers some time to implement this stuff.

t3_fssh2h,StudentLoans,What’s a manageable amount of debt?,"Hey everyone. I’m looking to move on campus this upcoming fall, and the pricing is astronomical. I have the option to stay home for free and commute- this is not ideal for me as I’ll be driving 1hr to get to campus 2-3 days a week. Or I could take out a private loan to secure on campus housing. 

Student housing for a year would be around $12,000.

Based on what I’ve paid in tuition and fees so far, if I stayed at home I would have approximately $25-30k in student when I graduate. 

If I stayed on campus for my final two years, my student loan would be double that (50-60k). My question is what is a manageable amount of debt to accrue? I don’t want to be paying on these loans for the rest of my life, or take several years to make noticeable dents in the principal amount. 

I’m a dual major for HR and PR, looking at a post graduate job in Dallas, TX if that makes a difference.","What’s a manageable amount of debt?Hey everyone.

t3_fshxsi,StudentLoans,The freeze on interest and payments let me get a really good look at my loan progress.,"And I want to f\*cking cry.

I have a loan with an original principle of $872.  After making payments on it for SIX YEARS! SIX! 6! I owe $879 on that loan.

I'm on IBR, and I pay a bit more each month than I have to.... not a lot, but I'm not paying just the minimum.

I just feel so disheartened.  Like... what's the point?","The freeze on interest and payments let me get a really good look at my loan progress.And I want to f\*cking cry.

t3_fsrodw,StudentLoans,Sallie Mae sent me an email today saying my 1098-E form is incorrect.,"Hello all!
I received an email today from Sallie Mae saying the 1098-E form that was sent to me in late January had an incorrect amount. They've sent an updated 1098-E and I've confirmed via the website that this is true and that I've paid a significant amount more in interest. The fun part is I've already filed my taxes and received monies in return. 
I should be keeping track of how much I pay in interest on all my loans to prevent this horrendous miscalculation from happening again. Has this happened to anyone before?

t3_fsgtwz,StudentLoans,Coronavirus Student Loan Tricks,"I know a lot of the details are still fuzzy but does anyone have any cool tricks they are using given the changes to student loans from the coronavirus.

Personally I no longer see the point of paying any amount on student loans right now since they aren't accruing interest until September. Don't see why I wouldn't take the money I was going towards student loans, put it in a high-interest savings account (like Marcus - 1.7% interest) and pay all that at once in September. 

I know this is pretty minor but am wondering if anyone else plans to do anything out of the ordinary","Coronavirus Student Loan TricksI know a lot of the details are still fuzzy but does anyone have any cool tricks they are using given the changes to student loans from the coronavirus.
