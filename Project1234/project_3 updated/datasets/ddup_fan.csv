1,t3_gbk0wz,FanFiction,[Prompts Challenge] Round 18: May 2020,"Hello, hello, and welcome one and all to May’s Prompts Challenge. We’re back again for some fanfic fun. Unlike the daily prompts, the goal is to write one longer fic based on one or more of the theme prompts here, to be finished by the end of May so we can all have a good read of them in June!

**Minimum word count:** 1000 words    
**Maximum word count:** 6000 words     
**Deadline:** 31st May

* Whenever you are done, post on FF.net or Ao3 if you wish. You don't have to wait until the deadline, though don't go linking it in /r/fanfiction until the deadline has hit, since we all want to get an equal chance and reading up on your works.
* A posting thread will be provided a day before the deadline is up.
* All participating fics will be collected in a showcase that'll be up for the entire month of June here on the sub
* There will also be an AO3 collection to add your fics to!
* **Change to the rules:** Although we still encourage you to get the fics finished by the end of May, and we’ll only be promoting the posting thread throughout June, the thread will remain open for late submissions and so will the AO3 collection.

Without further ado, the prompts!


#Poems

The other form of art built with words! This month we’re thinking about experimenting with poetry. Whether you write up your very own poem, get inspired by a specific poem, write in iambic pentameter, or have your characters engage in an epic haiku battle, we’re going to borrow a little inspiration from our sibling poet-authors this month.

*Note – if you actually do write a poem as your Challenge fic, the 1k minimum wordcount is waived. I’m not going to make you write an epic poem for your submission.*

u/brendenfraser also pointed to [The Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/) as a great place to look for poems if anyone needs a reference!

#Random Trope

I couldn’t resist bringing this one back since it was so much fun last time. PM me, poke me on the discord, or comment here and I will give you a random trope from the [TVTropes site!](https://tvtropes.org/). 

Don't generate them for each other, please. Picks will come from me. You'll get them within 24 hours of asking (so if you don’t get one after a day, it means I forgot or missed you somehow – feel free to poke me again!).

#Mayday, May Day!

Since today is the first of May, I thought it would be fun to include a little play on words here, haha. [‘Mayday’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday) is used to signal life-threatening emergency situations and [May Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day) is a traditional European spring celebration! If you’re using this prompt, pick one of the two meanings and start scribbling away! Feel free to combine the two if you can come up with something that fits, too. 

#Outside

Many of us are currently in lockdown or quarantine at the minute. This is a difficult time, stuck inside for much of the day, missing many usual markers of our daily routine. So for this prompt, let’s find some escapism in writing something from outside our usual lives. Right now, that could even be a normal work commute, but you could also take inspiration from nature or something much more outside (har har) the box. Go wild and get creative! If you do write something directly related to the current COVID-19 situation, please remember to tag it so people relying on fic for their own escapism can avoid it :)

**Any questions? All you have to do is ask! :D**"
2,t3_ggcred,FanFiction,Moving on from a semi-dead fandom to an active one is like finally reaching an oasis after a long walk through the desert.,"Honestly. I used to write for a small, basically-dead ship for another fandom. What little feedback I did get was very sweet, but otherwise it was radio silence. Then I watched a new show and fell in love with another ship. Started writing for this new fandom, and my god, guys, it's amazing. I'm no longer shouting into the void. People are not only reading, but RESPONDING to my writing. 

It's amazing."
3,t3_gg78sz,FanFiction,"I broke 300,000 words on AO3","I know I have written more than that number of words, if I count the words I posted in two other online lives, both on [FF.net](https://ff.net/) and Livejournal. But there is such a feeling of accomplishment, just knowing I have written more than 300,000 words in AO3. Just in AO3, within 16 works. My longest multichapter was 24 chapters, and I just posted the tenth chapter in my second longest one.

I've gone through different fandoms, and different moments in my life, but to be honest, in the last year, I've written and grown way more than in the past ten years.

I am incredibly proud of the handful of fics I've written in the past year, and even more of the human being I've become in such time.

It's a huge milestone. Even if in reality I know I'm closer to a million words. I am proudest of the last 300,000 words.

Knowing that I got into fandom and fanfiction more than twenty years before, I am truly fortunate to have AO3, and the me, that AO3 has helped create.

Cheers, everyone."
4,t3_ggbl7m,FanFiction,Posted the beginning to my long fic on AO3!,"It already has three kudos and it’s been less than a day since I posted it! I’m honestly shocked, this is my first time posting on AO3 too! Super excited to continue it"
5,t3_gfx0q8,FanFiction,Absolutely hate it when AO3 stories have this many tags.,"[Image](https://imgur.com/a/gpF7PIo)

I don't know why, but I have made it my personal choice to avoid stories and fanfics that have this many tags. If your tags are longer than your summary, I'm not reading it."
6,t3_gg8tp2,FanFiction,I'm actually writing a fic for the first time!,"So I have been a FanFic reader for about 5 years at this point and I just recently joined a fandom that's kind of dead on the platform that I look at most of my content on. I just recently watched an episode of the show (Battlestar Galactica) which is considered the biggest episode for my main ship/otp and while watching it I really wanted a character to say a different line and for things to turn out differently but he didn't. Today I wanted to do some writing but I have no OC's to play with so I used my OTP and I'm writing what I wanted to happen! I finally get to be the person who fixes canon when it throws you the bird. Also, I now respect people who write LongFics way more.  Writing 1,000 words is hard. So much respect. 

tl;dr

I'm finally writing a fic and it's super fun and gratifying and great writing practice and super satisfying to fix canon!"
7,t3_ggamev,FanFiction,There's always hope!,"A fic series I've been following that hasn't updated since 2011 just posted a new part today. Almost 11k words after 9 years of silence. I couldn't believe my eyes! I sent off a bunch of excited messages to my friends who don't even read fic, I was so amazed!

Don't give up on your old subscriptions to seemingly-dead fics. I feel so rejuvenated!"
8,t3_ggetsh,FanFiction,Reached the 100K Milestone,"For the first time ever, I've written a story that has reached 100K words. With its 23rd chapter, *Arrow: Rebirth* reaches that milestone. Sure, I might've written well over 100K altogether across all stories, but there's something heady about reaching 100K on a single story."
9,t3_gg588j,FanFiction,Anyone like fanon more than canon?,"As in, do you prefer fanon versions of certain characters over the canon? Do you enjoy fan content more than canon content? Are there things the fan base does better than the canon creators? 

Although this depends on certain fandoms, what are your thoughts?"
10,t3_gfym2s,FanFiction,I got my first Kudos!!,"I’m new to AO3, and I just got my first Kudos! I’m pretty happy lol, and I wanted to share! Person who gave me the kudos, if you’re reading this, you’re awesome!!"
11,t3_gfys4f,FanFiction,Feminist Propaganda or how I laughed at a 'bad' review.,"Tragic news to report, I lost a reader to one of my older stories  b/c they just couldn't take/accept: *""feminish propaganda that serves no real purpose in this story, undermines development of male characters and is completely at odds with real world.""* 

This review was for the chapter that showed the girls beating the guys in my story at a snowball fight. Inconceivable! Competent and talented women?! Impossible! My eGo!  I guess strong and/or smart female characters can be ScArY. 

I'll be the first to say all my stories have flaws b/c as a writer I have plenty of them, but this review just made me laugh.

So I ask this to all the talented writers out there: Have you gotten any reviews/comments such as this? Ones that made you laugh? Ones that were probably intending to be insulting towards you or your story but ended up being anything but. 

As for me I have more feminist propaganda to churn out so I'm signing off. 

I hope you and yours have a fun and safe weekend."
12,t3_ggcf45,FanFiction,What fanfic authors usernames can you name without looking it up?,"Mine are Em-Dash and GingerD. Tons more that I enjoy, but I can't quite remember their names. Just curious about y'all and wondering if I recognize any!"
13,t3_ggf5sq,FanFiction,Fanfiction is a valid coping mechanism,"  

I don’t know whether it is common, but I've mostly used fanfiction as a coping mechanism for my mental health issues and it has helped me push through hard times.

I've seen readers bashing authors when they have a character go through a traumatic experience for seemingly no reason, but I don't think it is shameful for people to get comforted from seeing their favorite characters go through the same struggles as they do.

Reading about my favorite character struggling with depression (even if in canon they seem to be a very happy person)  and overcoming it helped me deal with the stigmas surrounding mental illnesses and helped me rationalize it a bit more.

 So thank you, all current, past, and future authors for doing what you do. It might just be a silly hobby for some of you, but nevertheless, your hard work has brought joy to someone there reading your story."
14,t3_ggdts3,FanFiction,an epic review i got on my most recent fic,""" lol naked tifa hissing saying shouting smirking yelling at to her husband naked cloud strife i changed my mind i want kids and guess who their dad is going to be with cloud backing up pleading no way in hel which ended up with tifa riding her husband""

wat (idk what to flair this as, just thought this was bizarre. probably a troll)"
15,t3_gge94s,FanFiction,Lost Fanfic,"📷

Hey guys, l'm looking for a fanfic where tony survives Infinity war, and peter has to live with him because aunt may died during the war. Can you help me find it?"
16,t3_gfzqfn,FanFiction,I feel like I missed my fandoms glory days,"I feel like so many fandoms were super crazy during the early 2010s/late 2000s and now it's a bit more quiet. For my fandom, as far as I can see, there's only one big bang being held nowadays - it's focused on a specific and popular ship (I want to join and make some fanart because it's the only BB I see, although I'm not as crazy about the ship as a lot of people are in the fandom). There were like 2 artists for it last year, but going to old (LiveJournal) pages and it's seems old Big Bangs for this fandom were sooo much more lively. 

Of course I love making works regardless, but I do sometimes wish I got into it a bit earlier. Although I'm sure there must be some advantages of being part quieter fandoms over super active fandoms?"
17,t3_gfzwa5,FanFiction,"We get it you don't like tags, instead of making posts about it, here's a solution.","half the posts I see on this sub are people complaining about too many tags. it's just frustrating. so:

***IF YOU DON'T LIKE TAGS, GO TO PREFERENCES AND CHECK THE BOX THAT SAYS 'HIDE ADDITIONAL TAGS'.***

it's that easy!  people are gonna keep adding tags, no matter how many posts about this people make, and im getting really tired of seeing them.  yeah I know its annoying to have really long crossovers that tag every ship but it takes less than a minute to scroll past them. I prefer to have every ship tagged anyway, because if theres a ship in there someone dislikes, all they have to do is filter.

**Please, just go to preferences.**

(Edit: I feel like some of you aren't reading the 3rd paragraph so I'll state it here: **It takes less than a minute to scroll past a fic with 'too many' tags.)**

(edit 2: im tired of arguing with people in the comments, so ill stop for now. please, just think before you post, and don't just complain for the sake of complaining. if you want a solution, here ya go. im leaving, see ya!)"
18,t3_gg8ugq,FanFiction,Concrit Commune - May 09,"Welcome to the Concrit Commune, where you can get bits of your fic looked at... for a small ""price.""

For the purposes of this thread, concrit is defined as - pointing out things that could use improvement *and also* giving suggestions on how to do so.  Compliments are always welcome, of course.

The rules:

* State your `Fandom | Title | Rating | Any Applicable Content Warnings | Link - AO3, FFN, etc.` at the top of the comment.
* Post a few paragraphs (copy and paste to a comment, please) of your fic, or your plot premise, or your character bio, or your world building, whatever you need help with.  
* There is a soft **limit of 500 words**.  [Not your whole fic.](https://i.imgur.com/NTb9Mwu.gif)
* Please post an outside link to underage and extreme-explicit violence/rape content.  Pastebin is simple and doesn't require an account.
* If you, the author, are looking for something specific - the phrasing of a particular part or if a character's reaction is believable - please ask!
* If you just want to hand out advice without throwing your own fic in, you're quite welcome to.
* **If you post part of your fic you must give concrit to someone else in the thread!**

---
Since we're all here to give and receive help from other people, a certain level of respect for the author and the work they've put into their fic is expected as a baseline courtesy and should be reciprocated.

Tearing into a fic or author without regard for their effort isn't constructive even if there is decent criticism attached.  Moreover, it discourages people from participating if they know that insults await them.

You aren't expected to treat this thread like the Comment Cooperative, advice and honesty and pointing out flaws is what we're here for.

Some helpful tips to keep things running smoothly:

* Keep your comments helpful to the author, not just smashing out your opinion.  
* Be polite and civil.  
* Be kind. At a minimum, showing your peers professional courtesy is expected.
* Phrases like ""I think"" or ""I believe"" can lighten your tone.  
* Elaborating on *why* you think something could be changed is not only more useful to the author but keeps statements from being abrupt."
19,t3_gg7642,FanFiction,Could you guys just info dump about zombie apocalypse au's?,"I've only written a short one shot for this kind of au setting, and right now I'm trying to write a longer piece for it. But I'm not too familiar with this trope, so it'd be really helpful if people could just info dump or ramble about zombie apocalypse au's. Like what you like about them, what would you personally do in this setting, what helps this trope feel more realistic and ""lived in""? Or any other relevant tidbit of information!"
20,t3_gg089q,FanFiction,Do you think people who read/write fic have a different relationship with media?,"Sorry for the academic title, but this has been bugging me for awhile now.

I’ve been reading and writing fanfiction since I was 12 and have pretty much stayed with the same handful of fandoms into my 20s. You could say I have a obsessive personality, I guess. I definitely hyperfixate and I find it really rewarding to play with fictional universes (what if ____? How does ___ work? What would ____ do if ___?). I find it really hard not to, actually. I’ve spent over a decade with some of these characters and I’m still not sick of them.

My boyfriend is the complete opposite. He’ll watch a show, then immediately move onto another and rarely watches anything twice. I find this exhausting, honestly. What’s the fun in interacting with fiction if you don’t spend the time pulling it apart?

It’s getting to the point where it affects our relationship. He’s frustrated that I never want to spontaneously watch something new with him and I don’t know how to explain that it takes me so much emotional energy to take in new characters and universes. Rewatching just isn’t rewarding for him like it is for me.

I have noticed that my fandom friends tend to function more like I do, but I’d love to hear from you guys."
21,t3_ggavin,FanFiction,Sensitively-handled fic recs for recovery from rape?,"When I'm struggling with... shit. You know what helps me feel better? Recovery fics.  
Preferably no sex and really no description of the rape, please.   
Just exploring the idea of slowly learning to find happiness in the long-term aftermath of it. Any fandom is fine. Thank you if you have any recs!"
22,t3_ggf568,FanFiction,Downloading from AO3 to Kindle Fire?,"Got a second hand Kindle Fire a while ago, I heard that it supports AO3 downloads if I'm not wrong? I tried downloading directly through my Kindle's web browser, but it refuses to even access AO3 so that's pretty weird :/ Anyone know any alternative methods to downloading files from AO3 to a Kindle? Any help will be appreciated!"
23,t3_ggcan4,FanFiction,Why isn’t my fic coming up first in most recently updated when I just posted it?,This is for ao3 btw. The only advice I’ve seen on here is for people who save their fic as a draft and wait to post it but I posted it straight away? Why is this happening?
24,t3_gg5ly1,FanFiction,"To those who write in multiple fandoms, how do you do it?","I’m currently trying to enter a new fandom, but it’s really, really hard. How do you guys do it?"
25,t3_gflbdj,FanFiction,I don't think reviews fully understand the rush joy that an author experiences when they they get a review.,"Whenever an author gets an email saying ""A new review has been posted to your story"" or [AO3] Comment on x that there is a good 20 second window when the author you sent it to would kill for you if you asked."
26,t3_gg8uf1,FanFiction,Daily Discussion - May 09,"Welcome to r/FanFiction, I love you!"
27,t3_gfulcr,FanFiction,When you comment on someone’s fic and they recognize you,Have you ever commented on a good fic you’ve read only for the author to reply to your comment and hit you back with an “I love YOUR fics”? Something about validation from other authors is so fulfilling and satisfying. I once even had an author dm me out of excitement on my linked social media account after they saw I had kudosed their fic.
28,t3_gg0m4z,FanFiction,"1000 hits, 100+ Kudos, 30k+ words! And I'm only halfway there.","I just reached 1000 hits! This is only my second fic, and good lord have I expended so much more effort into this one. My first was riding a cresting wave of fans, and got me quite a bit of attention for a fic that was churned out in only a week. 

This second one has a so many damn set pieces and twice as many characters from a video game fandom that is coming up on five years old. I'll expect it to be nearly 70k words when I'm done, and for all that work I doubt it will get the attention my first story did.

But that's ok. I've enjoyed making it and exploring these characters and straining my writing abilities as I make my foray into new genres. It's keeping me sane in these crazy times.

Happy Friday everyone!"
29,t3_gfu6yy,FanFiction,Writing a fanfiction and my lovely housemate drew fan art for it,It makes me smile every time I look at it! And what’s better is that I’m writing a horror section right now so it’s been pulling me through!
30,t3_gfv1p9,FanFiction,My creativity's slowly dying and wasn't what it used to be,"In the past, I started up a project for myself for fun and poured everything I had in it:
My time, effort, even sacrificing a few things for it. It was great, the progress and quality I've done motivated me to keep going..

Until February of 2019 , when I took up tons of changes: joining a program, playing video games, watching Youtube, browsing, etc. and dropped writing ""for the time being"", hoping to pick it up when the other stuff aren't a big time commitment..
Except that the 'time being' wouldn't come. And if it did, I felt a drastic change.

What used to be my flowing writing slowed to a halt, my ideas, thought processes and overall time taken to complete a chapter and even write sentences suffered, as well as me putting off certain pages and writing in  general off.

Instead of writing, I do everything instead of it: Video games, browsing, just not taking it up. I get distracted easily, and my overall ideas for the plot is getting hazy. I used to get ideas really easily but now that's just not the case anymore.

What happened? All I want is to go back to what I used to do again.
All I want to do is *finally finish it..* Along with other thoughts competing whether or not I should abandon it. It started on June of 2018.

What can I even do?"
31,t3_gg6bfz,FanFiction,Romance; what do you prefer?,"Slow burn, or straight to the point?"
32,t3_gg8njv,FanFiction,Horror Flavors,"What are some of the most memorable scares you've read? What makes a horror story that sticks with you? What are some things that when read give you the shakes and the shivers and have you looking over your shoulder refusing to turn off the light at night?

There are so many types of horror. Like gothic horror, sci-fi horrors, cosmic monstrosities, home invasions, slashers, dark fantasy, creature features, and psychological. How does one go about selecting the perfect terror? And how does one avoid yawn-worthy predictability?"
33,t3_gg48jj,FanFiction,Going In Blind (Discussion &amp; A Little Vent),"Just an odd little question that has been running around in my mind: do you write in a way that a reader with no knowledge at all on the fandom can go in blind? Or do all your fics need some experience from you audience?

And if so, why?

Personally, I write a fics where someone who doesn't know the fandom can still enjoy a story, get attached to the characters and stay curious about the events unfolding. Therefore, I write a heck of a ton of descriptions, from characters to scenery.

Then again, the main fandom I write for (Bendy And The Ink Machine) has a very interesting character cast. Most of the characters aren't seen in their human form, and are only perceived in-game as their ink monster forms.

Therefore, descriptions are extremely vague -with only about one detail mentioned about a few of the characters in the franchise's first official novel- thus giving the fanbase the opportunity to 'create' these characters themselves, with no detailed canon description confirmed.

Backstories are also a little hazy and vague as of now.

This makes it easy for me to basically write a historical fiction/fantasy novel, that also doubles up as a fanfic for that particular fandom. I just find that by writing more intricately, it opens your book to more readers around the net, and not just the ones in your fandom, especially if your fandom is small and you want a bigger audience."

36,t3_gfnjft,FanFiction,You'll Never Guess Who Wrote This Fic!,"I was checking out a couple of fics on AO3 during my lunch break. Ended up reading through one of them. ""Man,"" I thought, to myself. ""This is really well-written.""

I was more impressed, the more I read. Seemed like the fic writer had gotten all of the characters' voices down more or less perfectly, and man, that's actually pretty hard. Most authors will get you somewhere in the vicinity, but you could've told me this was an excerpt from the books and I'd have believed it.

I finished the fic. It was excellent. I began to type a review praising them for their perfect mastery of the characters.

Right before I hit send, I went to another tab. Came back, scrolled up idly.

The author's name sank in. Oh. *Oh*.

tldr; TINFU by sending a review telling the author who had written a fanfic of their own books that they had gotten their own characters' voices down perfectly."

Normally I post on a schedule, one chapter a week, but currently don't have anything going on. So, out of curiosity:

- *As a reader* would you find it annoying or fun for a once-a-week-updating author to suddenly switch to a daily schedule for one week?

- It's a minor ship and I usual write gen, so if you didn't like the ship would that be obnoxious or would you be okay with it, knowing it was just for a short period?

- *As a writer*, how have you handled these kinds of events, and would you have done differently?"

43,t3_gga1ux,FanFiction,COLLABORATORS WANTED (Incredibles and Minions nonsense warning),"I'm desperate guys, I've been hard on luck finding people to help out.

Hey. So, I realized that the first time posting my concept in other places, it may not have been totally clear my whole goal and plan. If this is the first time you're seeing any mention of this, I'll explain for you guys. I haven’t been very successful getting people to help before, so I hope to better my chances here. (THIS SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, I KNOW, BUT PLEASE HEAR IT OUT AND GIVE IT A CHANCE, LOL THERE’S NO NEED TO USE CAPS XD)

In the event that you don’t read the whole thing, I’ll give you the current premises I have right away.

Absolutely Overkill plot (SUBJECT TO CHANGE): Scarlet Overkill has never had it perfect. She broke out of prison, and is in hiding with her husband, Herb. Her plans all seem to be falling apart. But things get about ten times worse when her aunt who had died of an illness many years before (and had been left with a spirit for a body), sees a chance to be powerful once again: by taking over Scarlet’s body. Scarlet, who is inflicted with an unpredictable curse and a ticking time bomb on her life, realizes that her villain ways won’t cut it anymore. On a journey that takes her back down memory lane, she must remember what it really means to be Scarlet, and save her life.

The Tale of Elastigirl and Ignatia plot: Helen Parr has been a superhero for as long as she can remember, and Scarlet Overkill has just adjusted to an entirely new life. DevTech has reinvented itself as “the world’s first superhero headquarters”, and is recruiting. Around this time, people in Municiberg begin mysteriously dying, and no one knows why. The city claims it’s a “plague” but the superhero community isn't so sure about that. Winston, desperate for answers, consults Trent Horwood who recommends the Overkills as their first recruits. 

Scarlet Overkill proves to be the most skilled, and Winston tells Scarlet and Helen that they’re the best fit to lead this mission. The problem is, they haven’t gotten along in decades, and were practically enemies. The superheroes all come together, led by Elastigirl and Ignatia, to stop any more deaths from occurring. Only one problem: no one knows who is doing this or why it’s happening. 

(this isn't a twist thing by the way).

Myself and my friend (basurtoj15, so much credit goes to her, special thanks ) have been working on two (fan) Pixar-ish movies. If you're familiar with Minions, and the Incredibles (or both), then this is for you. Please try to bare with me as I explain the whole situation.

The first movie is titled: ""Absolutely Overkill"". This movie stars Scarlet Overkill (the villain from the 2015 film) in what I like to consider a ""redemption"" film for the villain (there's a company situation here I'm aware about, but I'll hold that off until the end). The goal here is to convert her from a villain to a hero, something I was reluctant about at first but grew fond of. She'll go on a journey where she opens her heart, while we discover a lot about her past, etc. I felt this movie would be nice to do since Scarlet was a problematic character overall, I.M.O. She was kind of the Forgotten Franchise Antagonist. 

We've been trying to write out a good movie for Scarlet and Herb Overkill, and I really want to take her story in a different direction than most would expect. However, there's been some... blocks. Scarlet's story features powers, a sister, children, a curse... it's all over the place right now. I believe if this is done right, we can make this movie DAMN good... but it has to get there. So, that's the first movie.

The second movie would follow Absolutely Overkill, and this one is a crossover that combines the AO and Incredibles universes (again, I will explain the two different companies problem at the bottom). The film is titled ""The Tale of Elastigirl and Ignatia"", which brings the Overkills into the superhero universe (which is why I mentioned powers before), specifically bringing together Helen Parr/Elastigirl and Scarlet Overkill (now also known as Ignatia) who - apparently have a history... and it's not so super.

This came from watching Incredibles 2 (my favorite movie of all time), and the current premise is also in the works - though the movie will take a much more serious tone.

Alright, so let's get down to the logic of all of this. Including what I plan to do:

1.) Get the two outlines completed
2.) Write/revise the screenplays (as many times as necessary)
3.) Make a website advertising the films (though not spoiling) + art
4.) Apply to Pixar
5.) Hopefully gain respect as a creative member
6.) Pitch my ideas/negotiate the possibility of buying the rights to the Overkills from Illumination.
7.) Pray that the 0.0001% chance of this happening kicks in.

6 hopefully explains how I ""plan"" to fix the crossover problem. Though it's unlikely, it isn't an implausible option.

Anyway, steps 1-3 are the ones we need assistance with. You can be involved with as much or as little as you like. I normally work on this everyday, but I, BY NO MEANS expect that from you. A couple people would be helpful, as a lot needs to be done. If you're interested, either comment on this post or message me. Either way works for me. I hope to hear from some of you soon! Thanks!"

47,t3_gg23n3,FanFiction,Trying one last time (Yu-Gi-Oh Fanfiction),"I haven't really written anything in the past one, almost two years outside of the occasional chapter for one fandom or another. I've gotten to the point where I just can't write a single sentence no matter how hard I try or what strategies I employ that I've found online. These days, even thinking about writing   drains me of my energy.

 But I have sincerely enjoyed writing fanfiction before, and I want to try one last time to grasp that joy. So I'm going to try one last time. If it doesn't work out, I'll find a new hobby. 

Below is the Yu-Gi-Oh fanfiction I will attempt to use to revitalize my passion.  


Yu-Gi-Oh GX:
(1) Maiden in Love
Summary: In this Fanfiction setup, the main character is Blair Flannigan. It's an AU where she fraudulently enrolls at the beginning of the year instead of being a transfer student. As a result, she is placed in Ra Yellow because of her perfect exam scores (tied with Bastion). Blair's goal is to climb to Obelisk Blue before confessing to Zane,  but she comes across many challenges in proving her worth in this highly competitive assignment. 

This story will aim to utilize more minor characters (mainly Ra Yellow students, such as Dimitri, Brier, and Beauregard). It will also have a restructured Shadow Riders plot and--possibly--introduce a future summoning mechanic prematurely. (Either Synchro, XYZ, or Pendulum, but not more than one. I'm still analyzing the deck options for each mechanic). 


Thank you to anyone who takes the time to comment."
48,t3_gg0m4u,FanFiction,Does anyone need their femslash fic beta read?,"I've been struck by the sudden urge to edit (that's the English major jumping out) so I figured I'd use that urge to help some people out!

Qualifications: I'm a English major (I just finished my sophomore year), long-time reader and writer, and former copyeditor for my high school's literary magazine. So I'm not a professional, but I know some things :)

Requirements:
- Must focus on an f/f pairing (including other types of pairings is fine).
- No incest or pedophilia.
- No sexual assault or self harm, please.
- No PWP.
- There's no hard word limit, but generally no more than 10K words.

I'll check grammar, spelling, plot, and structure. If I'm familiar with the fandom I can check for accuracy and characterization. If there's anything in particular you want me to consider, let me know.

I prefer to work in Google Docs so I can edit grammar mistakes directly, but if that's not good for you, you can send me the fic in some other way, or send me a link if it's posted.

I'll mark this as closed if I get so many that I feel overwhelmed.

Let me explain: I have a google meet literature class every week as part of my uni course, and naturally we discuss like the type of things we read, the aspects of it, etc. So, teacher just asks about X topic and if we're reading something about it, or that have it. Immediately my colleagues start saying and showing things they are reading, and those are like, ""more important"" topics and things than fanfiction. I'm talking trans - people rights, the way women are portrayed in some book set in the modern age versus medieval age and stuff or national writers works, their writing style on x part of a story, why did it portray it in this way, you get the point. 

And then there's me, that spends almost all day (and night sometimes) reading ""not important and/or ridiculous things "" as fanfiction. I shouldn't feel this way, I know that, but in those moments I can't help it.

It's absolutely not inadequate or silly or anything and in no way fanfiction is a ""lesser"" genre. But still. It doesn't help that the fandoms I read, mainly Naruto and Harry Potter, can be considered ""childish"", you know? 

Anyway, rant over, thanks for reading! :)"

59,t3_gfubao,FanFiction,Turning Negative Energy into Positive Output,"I'm starting to notice a pattern...

* In the beginning, when I'm bored, I'd write fanfiction.
* But then sometimes when I'm mad, I'd write fanfiction too to sizzle off.
* Fresh out of college, when I found myself in a dead-end job with too much spare time, I'd write fanfiction.
* Next thing I know, I landed a career where I have to work 7 days a week - and that fueled me to write fanfiction to escape this harsh reality of constant work...
* The dating scene is unrelenting these days, but my heartbreak is often met with more fanfiction writing.
* And when I can't sleep, I'd turn on the computer and write fanfiction.
* I get tired and drowsy often, and sometimes I'd push myself when I realize I haven't achieved my daily goal yet.
* Most recently, the COVID-19 lockdowns boosted my writing speed from a record low of 25k words (or slightly less) to 38k words a month, even when I'm starting to get cabin fever and the associated angst and nostalgia for pre-COVID times.

Am I a masochist or something? Sure, I'd write every other time but it seems that the more life tries to torture me, the most productive I become. I managed about 450k words this year. Something tells me it would have been 25%-50% less if negativity makes me cower in fear.

Maybe I should seek out negativity deliberately to boost my productivity XD"
60,t3_gg3ag3,FanFiction,Small changes to established lore for the sake of OCs?,"So, this is pretty specific.

 I'm interested in writing a fic for the Fate series, specifically Zero and maybe the El-Melloi II Case Files, but how I wanna do it involves moving a few things around to fit some OCs. Now, nothing is changed to main plot. Everything that happens in Zero still happens, and nothing is really changed. But the main thing is adding two more masters and therefore two more servants. Now, I'd be making a new servant class, but it wouldn't be anything crazy.

63,t3_gg6m8e,FanFiction,Questions of the Writers of fan fics,"I myself am a new writer of fan fics, a noob to be exact. *cough* two months *cough*

An introduction to myself:

I have been reading fan fictions for a year now. I have read so much that I couldn't count them and also through the time got picky on choosing to read new books. I just felt inspired to write something that I appreciate. So after I woke up I immediately started planning on my first fic.

I RELIGOUSLY write every chapters round about 3000 words. I have published two books on WP (yeah wattpad shame on me)

One has already six chapters ready to read. I update them weekly. But since I have my finals I'm currently deep in crisis rn since i have to study and at the same time feeling inspired and wanting to write.

The other one I will start writing when I have finished my first one. I have the plot and concept thought and written.

I really want to improve already, even though I'm new to this. I kinda raised my standards on writing my chapters. I want to write  well rounded characters and their relationship between other characters.

Questions:

Is it better to Finnish an entire book first the OFFICIALLY publish it? (Or Finish the entire book, then weekly publish a chapter)

Is it better to update books chapter by chapter? (Example: chapter one is done and published but chapter two isn't planned and written yet.

How can I expand my vocabulary to utilize it on my writing? For the senior writers there haha how was it? 

Can I somehow improve my writing when I watch those book review on YT??

How long does it for you guys take to finish planning and writing a chapter?

Also about writing:

Such as making the reader care about my character.

Also making the character's relationship with another characters interesting and genuine  (friends an so on)


And an extra one:

For the designated smut writers: how do you do it? Haha.

I have read a lot of smut fics and I'm always amazed and cringe at the same time (in a good funny way) how do you write it?

I have tried writing one, it was too much for me and scrapped it. Bit I'm genuinely interested and would probably try to write one if I'm ready lol.


Thx :)"

Sometimes I feel like a fic “expires” after 48 hours and people are less likely to leave kudos and comments. I know no comment doesn’t mean readers didn’t like it, but there’s something about getting a comment on a 5 year old fic that makes you believe again! 

So thanks so much to people who comment on old fics. 💕"
67,t3_gfuzgv,FanFiction,Why do people include two ships with the same MC in one fic?,"Just to start off: I don’t want anyone to stop what they’re doing; writers are allowed to create whatever they wish. I’m just curious on the *why*. 


The other day I found a fic, which was amazingly well-written — easily one of the best ones I’ve ever read in that aspect. The author tagged one ship as minor and the other as endgame, which, to me, implied that the endgame ship would take up the most space and the other one would be like a mention or some small description in the likes of “yeah it’s not serious and they’ll break up as indicated by tags anyway”.


The thing is though that out of 20 chapters, 10 focus on the first ship and 10 on the other. There was no love triangle, which was good as the first relationship was clearly more of a physical thing and the other was “love of my life” thing, but still.


Why devote so much time and attention to a ship that will clearly not be end-game? Why make it so extremely shippy with thousands upon thousands of words of descriptions of dates and sex scenes and feelings? 


Now, I’m a multi-shipper and I like both of those ships seperately, but it just seems so weird to make a fic which is basically two ship-fics in one. I get that the author probably likes both of those ships as well and wanted to show them in their work, but like — people usually want their ship to end up together. 


If you involve a break-up for one of them then that part of fandom will stop being interested. And the other part of the fandom that prefers the other ship will most probably just skip over the parts with the first ship because they’re not interested.


I assume even multi-shippers like me who are not into love triangles and polyamory will be disappointed because they want to see all of those ships come to fruition and it can’t happen in a story like this.


I understand that a lot of people write for themselves and they may not care at all what the fandom thinks, but this is such an alien concept to me that I had to come here and ask for opinions."

I even know how I want the general atmosphere to be. But I just DON'T KNOW how to start oh my fucking god. I don't know what words to use. What I should say first.

But once I KNOW and start writing, everything else falls into place, like a dam bursting and flowing down, I don't know, a fucking waterfall.

So I ask you fellow writers here, HOW do you start a new chapter?? \*rips hair out"

\~Once turned a vampire, you're immortal (pretty basic I know)

\~Kids who are born vampires will age up to when their parents stopped aging. If the parents have an age gap of, for example five years. they'll stop aging at one extreme or in between.

\~Vampires don't turn everyone they feed on into vampires also, but can be done on accident for those who can't really control themselves yet.

\~Vampires whose parents weren't all human can vary in their traits. Some need to drink blood but keep aging, some aren't hurt by real silver, etc.

\~Vampires appear in cameras and in mirrors because we don't make them with the things that kept vampires from appearing anymore

\~Experienced Vampires typically go for the wrist but newbies will go for the throat due to what they've seen on tv

70,t3_gfybxe,FanFiction,I want to return to an old fic,"I wrote a fic with a buddy of mine several years ago. It was posted on Fanfiction.net, was never very popular, but it was still very fun to write. Unfortunately, when I graduated High School, me and that friend I wrote it with drifted apart a fair bit. Its been like two years since I last updated it, maybe even more. The story is not done yet, and I want to get it done just as a personal goal, and I've spoken with my friend about it and they want to continue it too.

Now, the problem is that we're in quarantine, and my friend currently has no computer to work on it from a distance. I wouldn't want to continue on my own, but I feel that if I wait too long to return working on it, either the old fans of the fic won't care, or I will lose the motivation to work on it.

74,t3_gg44ox,FanFiction,Instance where it would be better to review as a guest?,"I have a conundrum. There's been a new fic I just read which is a crossover in which my fic also lives. There's not a lot of them that tickle my fancy but this one intrigues me. 

Now I want to leave a review, but I feel conflicted leaving a review under my user name. I really like the ideas of this crossover (it twists in ways my story doesn't so they're very different) but I also have some questions/light criticism about the fic which I think could help the author make the fic better. I think leaving it under my user name could be awkward because I'm like one of three authors regularly posting updates for this crossover so I worry it would come off as bashing a fellow fic when I'm trying to do the opposite.

So the obvious easy answer would be leaving the review as a guest, but that also cuts off the means for communication and discussion in case they want to respond to my review.

Basically I want to leave a review but don't want to come off as a huge tool in the process. Anyone been in this situation too and can share their experience, or any thoughts?"
75,t3_gflg0q,FanFiction,Least favourite character trope?,"Personality, I dislike the the “bad boy” trope, used in highschool AUs. The “bad boy” is usually the love interest but acts absolutely HORRIBLE toward the person they like and even  beats them up! Usually what ends up happening is that the person they love just..FORGIVES them! 

Like...bruh...he was beating you up a while ago..why do you forgive him?!


Example:


Gordon Ramsay kicked Shrek to the ground and started to punch Shrek repeatedly, Gordon had tears in his eyes. “WHY CANT YOU SEE, I LOVE YOU, YOU IDIOT” Gordon cried as he got on top of Shrek, still punching him. “G-Gordon-San, I never knew you felt that way..” Shrek said as Gordon continued the punches. 

Shrek continued “I love you too” Gordon was speechless, his fists still hit Shreks face however..

OR they italicize everything but dialogue, like: *He walked over and sat down at the table.* ""Hi,"" *he said.* ""How are you today?""

And so on. There's lots of variations but I don't understand where they came from or why they're still popular. Any ideas? Thanks!

I doubt I’ll stick around the fandom long after I’m done, but I don’t want to leave my fic unfinished just for the sake of avoiding the other writer and her fans. This is the first time I’ve really been able to think about that fandom/story without pain, and also the first time when I haven’t felt scared about what the other author might say about me, so yeah, it’s a big step and I want to celebrate."
92,t3_gfe0h0,FanFiction,Someone just left a comment saying that they loved my fic!,"I dunno, it just made me so damn happy! They told me that they loved how I described emotion and how they couldn't wait to see more! This is definitely encouraging me to continue! It's so nice to get your work noticed!"
93,t3_gfiwwh,FanFiction,Too Afraid To Write Because Of The Fear Of Writing Awfully.,"So, I started a new few had a good chunck planned out, knew the major points and all that stuff.

Problem is, whenever i open google docs,i just can't seem to bloody get the words out, after further investigation i realised it is the fear or writing something terrible even tho i know when starting out in fanfiction,first couple of fics are not the greatest, right? you perfect when you write, yet i am still discouraged. 

I don't know what to do and i really want to write that fic so badly."
94,t3_gfd173,FanFiction,AO3 more welcoming to Queer Fiction than FFN?,"I'm the author of a queer fanfic in which one of the main canon characters is AU'd as transgender. Due to the nature of the story I never expected it to accrue much interest, but in spite of that it has found a modest following on AO3 where I originally posted it. It has over a hundred readers and every chapter is met with a few nice comments, which I appreciate. 

Meanwhile, when crossposted to FFN, the fic didn't really attract much attention. Initially this didn't really surprise me, I was double dipping after all and I figure lots of people browse both sites. But over time it accrued a few mean and frankly transphobic comments, ranging from ""Get this trans shit out of &lt;fandom&gt;"" to someone wishing that I'd burn in hell, to just one-line 'this is trash'. Also a few slurs. You get the jist. 

Whereas on AO3, the meanest comment was some concrit saying they otherwise loved the story but found a cultural reference out of place.

Has anyone else noticed this disparity? Ideas for why it is this way? I'm curious."

96,t3_gfme37,FanFiction,Daily Discussion - May 08,"Welcome to r/FanFiction, I love you!"
97,t3_gfnub3,FanFiction,Frustrated.,"So I've finally been back in the groove after several months of not being able to write for crap and have been tearing it up. The current chapter of what I'm working on is roughly around 12k+ and am so close to finishing it.

And now I'm stuck. I haven't been able to get past this one point for like two days now and I'm annoyed to no end. Come on Muse, you just got back from vacation, where'd you go this time?"
98,t3_gffm73,FanFiction,Readers - why do you stop commenting if I reply?,"I'm more sad than venting. It's happened a few times. Some gorgeous reader will pick up my fic and for a few days in a row I'll get comments about how much they're enjoying it.

My rule is to send a brief thank you message, and a smiley face, that kind of thing.  Light, but Happy.  I'm actually singing inside and walking around with a dumb ass smile, but I don't want to freak the reader out...

Because this always happens!! They disappear! It's like I keep frightening the birds away!

I guess it could be a horrible coincidence that they lose interest in the fic just as I say g'day, but it's followed this same pattern so closely I'm starting to wonder what else could be happening.

Have I put pressure on them? Is the sight of the writer just too off-putting? Please tell me if I should stop replying.

😔😔"
99,t3_gfbatm,FanFiction,This is why plotting doesn't work for me,"I made a post a few days ago celebrating that I had plotted out the rest of my longfic after pantsing it since the beginning. That was great...at the time. Now, since I know where the fic is going and how it will end, I keep getting ideas for its sequel and it's driving me CRAZY because now I want to start writing that instead. Grr! Does anyone else have this problem?"
100,t3_gfq640,FanFiction,"Canon involves a lot of deaths of major character throughout the story, but I have a problem doing the same in my FF","I'm writing for fandom, which tells rather a sad story. It's a game and basically it shows player, that everyone is dispensable and they can die at any moment. To amplify this feeling, the main character is kind of clingy type and he really attaches to many of those characters, which eventually end up dead.

So I'm writing my story canon compliant and want to have a similar feeling. To show readers this is not happy, love story, but dark realism for those characters. But I have a problem with my OCs. I created a bunch of them, with few being major characters. And I can't really seem to kill them throughout the story. They seem too important to be killed and I don't have much of canon characters I could kill off. Or at least those, who people would care about. I don't want either to create more characters to just kill them for an effect.

So who do you guys deal with those kinds of stuff? When you grow attached to the character and just can't find a reason to kill it, even if you know its necessary for sake of the story."
101,t3_gfojlx,FanFiction,Have you ever written a follow-up chapter for a oneshot? How did it go?,"Recently I decided to make a few oneshots after the series finale of Clone Wars just for fun, I showed them to some discord friends and they told me to post them so I did. 

Well, all three of them out-performed my multi-chapter fic I've been working on for over a month in a *single day*.

I've since gotten reviews asking for more chapters, or follow-up oneshots so I'm curious, has anyone ever written a follow-up for a oneshot or added another chapter? How did that go?"
102,t3_gfn3oj,FanFiction,A deleted fic. (Not sure if flair applies but whatever),"So, I’ve been looking for a fic for a couple hours now. I found it when I realized that I used to bookmark FanFiction’s when I used Safari to read (ouchie, how could I commit such a heinous crime). Anyway, I found it. Big fun. But it’s unavailable. Big sad. So I can’t find the author to email them asking if I could read it again. Ouchie x 2. I have a link to the page, any help would be appreciated. https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11821304/1/"

I kind of feel like I'm wasting the good day here.

I have one project I'd particularly like to work on.  
I have now reached the emotional climax of my story.   
The 'all my hopes and dreams are crushed' BSOD. And I haven't the foggiest idea how to write it.

I'm two chapters away from the ending of my multi-chaptered fic and I'm desperate to get it done but shit fuck I'm not getting anything down... I'm just staring at an empty Google Doc. 

Send help."
105,t3_gf6ovv,FanFiction,Creepy/stalker-ish reader? Anyone experienced this?,"A few months ago, I started getting a lot of comments from this reader on ao3. They were SO nice. They  left a lot of compliments and lengthy comments explaining what they love about my writing style. I replied to each of the comments since long comments were rare for me. They were really sweet and they genuinely seemed to like my stories.

In the end, they asked me if I was on any other social media. I gave them my twitter. They followed me there and asked if I was on tumblr. We talked on tumblr for a bit. They seemed really sweet and they said they were a huge fan of me and somehow they ended up following me on reddit/wattpad/instagram. At this point, I was a little freaked out but they would send me messages everyday asking me how I was and telling me how amazing I was etc. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but messages EVERY DAY for MONTHS! (Five to be exact)

I replied to as much as I could. But thinking back, I'M SO NAIVE! Damn. They turned out to be really really creepy. Their messages got weird.

This is a message which I copy pasted:

Awwwwweeeeee! You're sooo awesome! I may be in love wit you xx i have some friends who write too..... they always ask me to read their story but tbh they are shit at writing... ur sooo good! can i maybe get your fb account? i'd like to follow you there! xx marry me xx also can i see your photo? im super curious how you look like! thanks xx plz send me a photo, love :)

Uhm I had no idea how to reply lol. They send like twenty messages a day and ask for a picture every other day. Really persistent too. Am I weird for thinking this is weird??? Maybe they are just a huge fan but honestly my writing is not even that good. I feel like they're trying to scam me or something. So weird. I ended up blocking this person everywhere, but I'm really curious what this person was trying to do.

Let me know your opinion! They don't bother me anymore, but I want to know if I overrreacted. I am a huge people pleaser and tbh I lowkey feel bad about it. (Yeah, I know I'm NAIVE) This is the first time this has happened to me. I keep wondering what they were thinking...."
106,t3_gf9iwn,FanFiction,"Just got back into writing after ages, and I'm happy with my fics--but I have no web presence","I used to write ages ago, mostly Undertale, and I had a blog at the time that wasn't exactly super popular but had some interest. I would get requests from time to time, and fulfilling them made me really happy. 

Now I've gotten back into writing for a variety of fandoms, and while of course I'm immensely grateful for my readers and especially my commenters, I really miss that extra level of engagement. I haven't had a Tumblr for over a year and my Twitter presence is really just limited to my friends; I made a separate account just for posting fic but it has zero followers. I feel like when I'm writing I'm basically putting stuff out into the void to maybe get comments, and I miss the opportunity to do requests, fic exchanges, gifts, and maybe someday even commissions. I just don't know anyone in fandom spaces as an author well enough to be at that level, and I'm struggling to figure out how to get to said level. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Any suggestions for increasing my web presence?"
107,t3_gfrowv,FanFiction,Looking for a Kylux omo fic,"It was pretty basic, pretty mild about Kylo making Hux wet himself in a conference room using the force. 

I'm not sure if it's on other sites, but on AO3 it was deleted. It's called ""For My Eyes Only"" by psicod\_brenda39. If anyone knows where it is or downloaded it pre-delete, I would be very grateful. I just loved that story."

And I'm not talking about mere references, nods or well-realized novelizations/POV switches, I'm talking about straight up scenes/entire plots rewritten for a fic.

Extra points if:

1. It involves a crossover where the outsider character/characters don't affect the story whatsoever and are simply there adding minor, glaring quips to the canon plot.
2. An exact reenactment of a work with characters from other fandoms."
110,t3_gfmgc2,FanFiction,Searching for a Kim Possible fanfiction,"Hi I've spent the last two days looking for a Kim Possible fic I've read before and am unable to find it. 

The part I remember is Kim dies, either before the fic starts or in the first chapter or two, but her brain gets preserved while they, I think its G.J. but I might be wrong, create her a new body. Kim is not fully aware but her brain is active while she is just a brain (and eyeballs I think) and in constant pain. The new body has Shego's powers but Kim is unable to control them so Shego gets called in.

I never know how to end a message so thanks for at least considering helping even if you don't know the fic I'm talking about."

Does anyone face such experience before? And is there any way to overcome this? I’ve been writing fanfiction for six years and I’m afraid I’m just so used to writing with borrowed universe and characters that I can never write my own novel ever..."

I live in the United States, so I just want to make sure that it's not so distracting that readers can't stay invested. The setting is the Mad Max movies, which are in post-apocalyptic Australia. Is there a certain day/thread for this?

120,t3_gfl83b,FanFiction,Do you think is possible to revive old fandoms ?,"Lately I've been re-watching and re-reading a lot of fandoms I'm still a part off, but had to watch slowly die.

And I always found it really sad, but I've got way more sad, not only because I have no or almost no fanfic being updated, but because I realized something very important :

These stories are way better and deeper than I had realized at the time, and I was only able to see that because the times changed and some subjects are treated way more seriously now, not because of my age.

Like, one character that I found cute but very annoying and weak was KHR Lambo.

  But now I see that he actually can speak at lest 2 languages at the age of five. And that his family is pretty messed up, not only they used a little kid as a hitman but they send him after someone who could have killed him (Reborn) and just gave him away to people they didn't knew anything about on the first opportunity.

His new family also treats him or like an annoyance or like a cry baby, even the kids like him. And let's just think about how he knows at least some part of that shitty future and how he probably has killed people before...

Another character was Jafar from Magi, actually magi as a whole. It's one of them only 3 animes settle in the middle east and it should have got more love. (But the manga is better and more complete.)

I used to see him as a very gentle, happy and hard working person. The usual mom of the group. But only after re-reading both Magi and Sinbad no Bouken I realized he was way more complex than I thought. I mean, he basically faked a entire new personality for the sake of his friends and also for fear of losing his new family. He need to pretend to be normal while keep feeling gilty for being an assassin inside. He doesn't want this evil personality, but he can't control himself since it what he is. 

Besides it the closes thing to a mom that he had to a mom, one of his best friends and the only two people that could understand part of what he went through were killed by his own organization in a very dark way. An it left Hinahoho without a wife, Spartos without a brother and the kids without a mom.

And he actually lost his entire childhood, part as an assassin and part helping sinbad to create Sindria and working all day, and those scars on his leg didn't came out of nowhere. Jesus, I didn't remembered this show to be so dark !

Killua is another assassin who probably should see a therapist, but everybody and their moms know it already.

And Kamui from gintama is another poor kid who had his entire childhoo throw in the trash, and had not only had to take care of his baby sister by himself but also see his mother slowly die while having age enough to understand what was happening.

Hijikata was also mistreated in his house for being a bastard and had no friends until Kondo. The only person that liked him was his brother, that ended up blinded by some thiefs. He killed the thiefs when he was very probably 10-12, and ended up being treated way worse after this.

And Gintoki had to steal from CORPSES to survive as a kid. But I guess everybody noticed this one.

Yahiko from  rurouni kenshin was basically a slave.

Fai from Tsubasa Chronicles is one of the most gentle souls I've ever saw, and is also depressed and probably suicidal.

Nico di Angelo is the youngest in his group (Yes he is younger than Hazel, long story short, Rick's math is worse than mine.) and only had friends older than him, he also fought in two wars and went alone to tartarus. And in the end of Blood of Olympus he is only 13, around the age of Percy in the first book.

Kuroba Kaito is literally fighting with the most dangerous organization of his world, his best friend's father, the whole police, Conan, and literally everybody else. His only useful help is one old man that can't really help him directly in a fight. And he got hurt and almost died some dozens of times but had to pretend everything was ok so no one would be suspect.

APH Russia has no friends and the mind of a literal child. He doesn't understand what he was doing wrong since he is only doing to people what others have done to him, and he thinks this is how everybody treats eachother.

APH Sealand sold himself on ebay because he was lonely. 

APH England loves and cares for the other nations but not even his former family (the children he raises) have any love or respect for him. His only friends are fairies and France, and him and france hate eachother. His brothers are always being mean to him 

APH South Italy/Romano is not even reconized as a part of italy. He thinks that everybody hates him because he is not as good as his brother. And just to make things better, him grandpa left him but took his brother, and spain begged to trade him for feliciano but Austria refused saying taht north Italy was better.

Rin's brother Yukio from ao no exorcist said he wished Rin had died, just after Rin losing his father, his humanity and discovering that his whole. He was trated as a monster since he was little and the first friends he ever had basically bullied him and called him a Demon (probably the most hurtful part.). All of this despite him always trying to be a good person.

Kageyama was heavily bulliedby his old friends and mistreated by the person he used to admire the most.

Those are all comedy relief characters. Those things where many times used lightly, as a joke, or with no future consequences !

But now is 2020 and the world is different and I want to talk about those things. But I realized they will totally fly over other people's heads since no one cares for these stories anymore... and a lot of new people will never get to meet them since no one is talking anymore !

There are a lot more of other character with inssues that no one realized at the time.

And I really think we should all discover what we can learn from on older fandoms, but at the same time I don't know if it is possible.

I know this was long and full of bad english (is not my first language.), but what do you think ?"
121,t3_gfl6dm,FanFiction,Word to HTML Converter,"Here's a Word to HTML Converter, mainly for people that want to convert their fanfiction from [FFN.net](https://FFN.net) to AO3 without manually entering HTML code.   I used it for my fanfic and it works great. Click [here](https://wordtohtml.net/)."
122,t3_gf3n5d,FanFiction,Another weird fanfic experience post,"Ok so, here's the thing: I just saw two posts, one about forgetting a fanfic's plot because it wasn't updated for so long, and now you have to reread it, and the other about reading so many fanfics of the same genre for the same fandom that you lose track of what is what. 

Now get ready for: Writing so many fanfics that you lose track of what happened in which one, and at what point, so you have to go back and read your own fic again to make sure you don't repeat anything. 

I'm currently writing three different fanfics, uploading a new chapter for one of them every weekend and new chapters for the other two every other week, and while they are vastly different, I still sometimes get confused if I've already included a certain plot element or something, so I have to go back and read it, which can be a bit frustrating sometimes, and then I either find it or I don't, but most of the time I forget what I was looking for in the first place. 

Anyone else know this feeling?"
123,t3_gfp4x1,FanFiction,Is there any Percy Jackson/Magi crossover fanfic,"My favourite character to read about this probably percy and I keep having the idea since maybe a year ago when majorly browsing the Percy fanfics. I would prefer a transferred over to keep his godhood for max awsomeness 

(I would write the story myself if I was actually good at writing but I’m bad and don’t want to be one of those people)"
124,t3_gfp056,FanFiction,Are there any harem fics that has a “bro’s before hoes” like ending? Or at least have some bro moments? (Not counting gay harems),"With all of the harem fics/games/anime I’ve seen, there never seem to be a single bro in them(unless it’s a gay harem). I think having a bro in a harem can really lead to some funny and/or heartwarming scenes. Is there at least any harem fics out there that have some kind of bromance?"
125,t3_gfiujw,FanFiction,Any helpful plotting templates/methods?,"So I was always a pantser, and a while ago I decided to outline my first fic, after pantsing for the first 4 chapters. I planned 31 chapters and it was the best thing I could’ve done. But that took months, and to this day I’m adding on little things and regretting choices. Also, I literally just wrote down what I wanted to happen next like I was summarizing it for someone with little details added in.

Now it’s really hard to navigate through and I was wondering if anyone has some kind of template or method that’s for people like me who just want to have an easier time plotting. Thanks in advance!"
126,t3_gfjync,FanFiction,Where's the line? Long fanfic - to start or not.,"Hey! First post here. Just wondering your thoughts on where the line is with long fanfics on whether to start or not. 

So for example if you were a reader on one of your favourite fanfic tags and you see a fanfic you've not come across before and you like the blurb and then see 22 chapters 200,000+ words and not finished yet, would you start it?

Or by that point is it likely to be mostly people that began reading nearer to the start of the fic and have stuck with it? 

Maybe on the flip side there's people that only read the longer fics? Because it's more to read than shorter ones?

Personally, I know I've liked the sound of some and bookmarked them but not actually read them yet due to length. I will at some point, but I like to read in one go so I usually wait until I have time to read it all.. (Though I'm talking like 90k fics in total)"
127,t3_gf9hpq,FanFiction,Biggest Fanfiction Peeve?,Okay so I was wondering what people couldn't stand most about certain fanfictions. My biggest peeve is when they take a main character and make him completely different than how he is in the show. Like I'm okay with a little au or OC but doing a complete 180 is annoying.
128,t3_gfhdki,FanFiction,Is this canon divergence or AU? (Hunter x Hunter fandom)? How do I tag it?,"You probably need to be familiar with Hunter x Hunter to answer this question, but I'll try to explain the aspects that are different from canon, so you might be able to answer my question, even though you're not familiar with the manga.

Basically, the premise of my story is this: Kurapika is forced to use judgement chain on himself by the Spiders; the condition being that he must obey all orders from Chrollo Lucifer—the leader of the Phantom Troupe. But Chrollo can't kill Kurapika either, because according to a fortune he received (Neon's ability), he needs Kurapika to find something.

My story is different from canon in several ways:

- Kurapika was never forced to use judgment chain on himself, resulting in him having to obey Chrollo.

- Chrollo never received a fortune about Kurapika having something he needed.

- In canon, Kurapika doesn't have anything Chrollo needs, which means there's nothing stopping Chrollo from killing Kurapika.

How should I tag this? Should it be ""Alternate Universe"" or just ""Canon Divergence""? Both? Since the story is basically set in the canon universe, with a few changes, I'm unsure if it's AU. 

Will my story be filtered out if I tag it as AU? I really dislike high school, coffee, modern AU's myself; however, changes made in canon universe is usually fine for me, and I think a lot of readers might feel the same. So, how should I tag it?"

130,t3_gfdu09,FanFiction,Tips for retelling the story of an RPG but with your own customized hero (Inquisitor from Dragon Age: Inquisition)?,"So usually I don't do these kinds of fics, but I ended up thinking of what I hope might be a really interesting hook for the protagonist lol. I'm just getting stuck at the beginning. For some reason, even though the beginning is basically mapped out I have trouble writing it so that it seems interesting? I feel like I'm not choosing the right details of the scene to focus on. I also worry I'm going to miss a critical detail and mess up the entire plot structure lol.

143,t3_gfl0u5,FanFiction,can be for any fandom,"How would a man tell his girlfriend's teen daughter that her mom has gone missing while on a date? He is like the girl's stepfather already, never mind that, a father, because she's never had a real one. He abandoned her when she was a baby. She's in a remote location with a friend she trusts, for a funeral for her dead girlfriend that nobody else really knows too well, but there's barely any cell service. When she gets the message, this ""friend"" she's with turns out to be a psycho set out to kill her.

The same situation goes for another teen girl with a stepfather that's more of a dad to her than her bio one was. This girl is at home with her siblings, when suddenly, three men from her mom's ex-boyfriend's drug cartel storm into her house and try to kill her because she ratted her mom's ex boyfriend out to the cops and got him ten years in jail. She kills these men in self defense, she's gone to shooting ranges plenty of times and is confident in holding a gun. She gets the text when she's finished with them and is calling the police to remove the bodies.

There's not really much these young ladies can do, and their mothers are going to be found in a few hours, but I know the guys should tell them, I just don't know how. I also don't know how exactly the second girl can remove the bodies from her home and claim self defense and have police believe it. Her male friend is just outside and he's heard the gunshots. He knows she was defending herself."
144,t3_gfkqup,FanFiction,for any fandom,"So, I was gonna have my main character abducted by her jealous ex after he and his minions kidnap her friends, but since others are going to be looking for her friends, she would know about it and would be at the police station, too, and worrying, and not just with her boyfriend and sons at her apartment. Her ex wouldn't be able to get her alone, she'd want to stay at the police station for her and her sons' own safety because of this mass kidnapping spree. Is it better if I just have her get kidnapped first and hidden in a closet, gagged and bound, before her friends get captured? That way her boyfriend can go to the police and tell them it might be the ex doing all this and he knows the guy's name, too. Easy search.  

Only thing is, she would've told her boyfriend to go home since she's tired (under the instructions of her ex, or he'll kill her loved ones, starting with her aunt-who's taken care of her all her life, and then her boyfriend) but then her boyfriend wouldn't be worried about her not answering since he thinks she's sleeping, plus, he'd offer to stay and watch her sons for her, so what would be a better excuse to tell him? If she says she's sick, he'd stay to take care of her. If it's her son who is ""sick"" he'd help out. The only thing I can think of is she says nasty things to him to make him leave, but he just knows that's not her and would immediately be suspicious. She can't say work, otherwise he wouldn't suspect anything is wrong when she's not answering her phone, plus he knows it's her night off. That's why they're having dinner at her apartment. BTW, they're a honeymoon stage couple, so he isn't worried about catching anything from her or her kid."

You see, I have a character Q&amp;A that I posted as an aside to my Team Fortress fanfiction series. It helps people wait for the next chapter to upload, and I find it quite awesome to act as the characters in my own “universe (since not everything is technically canon, of course).” However, the first time I did it, I got several questions from the same two people, and this time I have absolutely questions to answer at all. That is why I have turned to this subreddit. All you have to do is ask your own personal questions about your favorite Team Fortress character(s). You can also ask *me* questions too. There are many OCs in this fanfiction as well, so they are also up for grabs. Don’t worry, it’s an adventure, nothing cringey (as far as I can tell). It is called “Team Fortress: Soaked Through.” I know that links are against the rules, so I will give you every means to search it up. In fact, you just need to think of your Team Fortress character and ask them a question, although their personalities in my story may be a little different. I really hope this works, because, after this, I don’t have any other options. If you have an idea about where I can get more questions, I would love to hear from you. Nothing sexual, no personal information from me, though. You guys know the drill."

150,t3_gf29wj,FanFiction,I feel guilty about writing RPF,"(I'm 25.) Since my long-term partner and I don't live in the same household, 50+ days of quarantine has made me miss them a lot. To compensate for my lonely feelings, I've reverted back into some of my old habits and started reading RPF again for the first time since high school, specifically reader inserts. During my most recent bout of loneliness, I was frustrated when no fics were satisfying to me. In classic fanfic writer fashion, I instinctively started making a plot for the kind of story that I wanted to read. When I was done with the outline, I got hit with this huge wave of guilt.

I was heavily involved in bandom (do they still call it that?) for so many years that I still have notebooks full of cringy fics. Part of me wants to post this on AO3 or something because it'd be a huge personal milestone. But now that I've grown, I see things differently. These are real people with real lives and feelings -- I respect them so much that if they explicitly expressed that they didn't want fics written about them, I'd trash everything in a heartbeat, public or not. I'm so self-aware of the situation; even though the real person has said that they don't mind fanfics, I still feel incredibly conflicted about it right now.

I even feel ashamed about publicly admitting it here, but I really needed to get it off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: It turns out that I was less feeling guilty and more afraid of people's judgement. I didn't want anyone to think that I was still starry-eyed at my age. I've gotten enough validation to say that I'll be writing and finishing my fic. I'll figure out whether or not I'll post it when I'm done. Thank you everyone. :)"

So in paper i have already the ideas for the Fusion, Standard, Synchro, XYZ, Back to Fusion and Zarc sagas and also some ideas i wanted to include like:

\- The inclusion of Custom Cards, Archetypes and more support for the unfinished archetypes (Nate's Yo-Kai Deck, The You Show Kids' Aquactess, Performachine and Doodle Beasts)

\- More fun duels at the LDS Junior admission and the inclusion of fan-favorite archetypes (EX: Kaijus, Generaids, Entities, Ghostricks, Madolche, etc...)

\- The inclusion of more Legacy Duelists and some replacing others and make them more important to the plot (Like Pegasus, Mokuba, Bandit Keith, Dr. Crowler, Tetsu Trudge, Jaden replacing Aster, Reginald or Shark and Anna Kaboom)

\- Making Leo Akaba a despicable villain rather than the dissapointment we got.

\- Make the Brazalet Girls actually useful and competent duelists with Yuzu learning new Summoning Methods.

\- Give Arc-V a better ending

161,t3_gez8or,FanFiction,The only one of it's kind.,"Hello.

Do you know that moment when you find a story by accident while looking for another, and it turns out really good?

 I found a story and the premise was great, and it was well written for the first few chapters. However, the whole story revolved around a past event happening to a character that didn't happen in canon. The story devolved into the character switching between their canon personality and their personality as effected by the event. At first it was explained by the character trying to blend in with their peers, thus acting canonically. Eventually, though, it just seemed like the past event didn't really have any impact, and I dropped the story. That was just one problem of many that I had with the story.

Anyways, since I liked the idea of the story, I searched up the tags and such on different sites.

Nothing came up.

It was a crossover story, and there were few stories between the fandoms to begin with, but with that basis for a story, there were none. 

Now I'm super disappointed and there's a little fanfiction shaped hole in my heart.

Does this happen to anyone else?

Thanks."
162,t3_gf179m,FanFiction,tfw when your interests are so niche that literally nothing appeals to you,"please don't take this as an insult, this is just a testament to how dumb i am. i think i'm in the minority here where yes, i write and publish my fics, but i seldom interact with the fanbase otherwise. mostly because there is nothing that satisfies what i'm looking for.

when i do take the plunge into either ffn or ao3, i pretty much give up immediately. a lot of what i see is either frustratingly nonsensical (it's supposed to be goofy but it's not funny, interesting, or well written enough to warrant my attention), or just straight up bad and overdone (looking at 100% of the popular fics in my fandoms).

this lack of content is specifically why i started writing fics. there was literally nothing for someone like me. the closest i got to something appealing to me was SO close, but then the author veered it into a goddamned tree by having everything in a virtual reality or something (??) and it was basically a ""link between real world and virtual world"" story which i do not like at all. it still hurts me, i was so close to having something someone else created that i enjoyed. but no...

182,t3_gezvp6,FanFiction,Beta Bartering [Find or Offer Fic Betaing] - May 07,"Welcome to Beta Bartering!  Here you can look for a Beta for your fic or offer your Beta services to fic authors.

The rules are straightforward.  

* Make a comment below with the following information.

* Reply to people that you want to trade with.  There is no one making matches for you, reach out to likely people in the thread.

If you're **looking for a Beta:**

* Name and Link to your fic (if it's not published, link something else as an example of your writing).

* What fandom you're writing for.

* Can someone who isn't in your fandom make sense of your story?

* The genre of your fic - romance/smut/gen/mystery/horror/etc.

* What you're looking for from a Beta - Grammar/Structure/Plot/Planning/Idea soundboard/etc.

* What your projected word count is.

* How frequently you update.

* What fandoms you are able/willing to beta for **or** what you can offer in exchange. *

If you're **willing to Beta** for someone:

* What fandoms you're well versed in or if you're willing to take on anything.

* Preferred genre/types of fics.

* Any subjects you're **not** willing to tackle.

* Types of Betaing you're good at or willing to try - Grammar/Structure/Plot/Planning/Idea soundboard/etc.

* Minimum or maximum word count.

* One-off (single session) or ongoing Betaing.

* Time constraints.  Do you have a fast turn-around time?  Is it going to be more than a week for you to get back to an author with notes?

* What you'd like in exchange * for your services.

\* **Bartering!**

Since some people want Betas and are too busy to reciprocate or aren't confident in their writing skills... and some Betas don't write fics themselves, you can offer other things in exchange.  (Let's stay away from monetary exchanges, shall we?)

Here are a few ideas for bartering:

* Reciprocal Betaing (of course that's welcome!)

* Write a fic for a fandom/subject/pairing/brotp of their choice.

* Make fanart for them.

* Name an OC after them.

* Edit/give assistance with a non-fic project.

* Research help for this/future fics.

Feel free to get creative, people have many specialties they can draw on!

183,t3_gercrt,FanFiction,Cover art on AO3 as a gift to my favorite writers?,"So basically...I'm thinking of making art covers for my favorite ffs on AO3 since I'm so bored doing absolutely nothing at home and I believe I have the skills to make something nice.  
I'm used to doing that all the time on different ff sites but here...I'm a little hesitate because I'm new to AO3 and I noticed no one really uses art covers on there and I just keep thinking back to that one meme 'Woah...this is worthless' and I feel like that's what writers will secretly think too if they were to receive something like that."
184,t3_geqqmq,FanFiction,The Power of Comments,"Recently, I've been feeling kinda down about a fanfiction I'm writing. It has a pretty small (but still significant) following, and I'm 150k+ words in so I can't and don't want to just ditch it. But I did that thing where you write yourself into a box, and I was stuck.

Someone left a comment asking about a certain sub-plot I had that was kind of just... abandoned. It was the main premise for the fic, but I kind of left it. I was even more down because what about all the other directions it went it? There were a million different ways I could have taken my fic, so of course there would be some dispute. But I still hoped they would have seen the fic in a more positive light.

Basically, it wasn't the nicest comment, but it brought up some damn good points, ones which although they had been somewhere in my mind needed a light shining on them. That comment was like a good kick up the arse to get going again. I didn't realise how much I needed that. My story was getting boring - going round in the same sort of circles and never really making an impact on the overall plot.

Of course I didn't think that at the time. It wasn't until around an hour later I got a hell of a lot more positive comment that boosted my spirits a little, and made me really start to think about where in the fuck my fanfic was going. 

So, I owe my renewed inspiration and direction to one slightly mean comment I got. It shit all over what I've written over the few months, but hey, people are allowed to think what they want. And thank fuck someone spoke up, because my story never would have gotten out of this ditch otherwise."
185,t3_gev9ar,FanFiction,Writing Friendship Subplots,"Having friendships be put on the back burner and never having any resolution in favor of solely focusing on the MC's romantic interest is a common trope\*. A trope that isn't exclusive to fanfic, but it's something I'd like to avoid. I've just read too many fics where (non-lethal) conflict with other characters is established and never mentioned again--other than to inform you of how wrong they were.

While yes, the main focus of my fic is going to be the romance, showing that both characters have people they care about outside of each other is important to me. Especially since one of the MC's conflicts is his rocky relationship with his friend. Which could easily lead down the road of demonizing said friend and perpetuating the trope\* of 'only the love interest really cares about the MC'.

However, I am very aware that a lot of readers who will click on my fic will be expecting a sole focus on the main relationship. I get it and I'll admit I've been guilty of clicking on a fic and skimming until I get to the pairing interactions. 

**Do you guys have any advice on writing about a MC's relationships outside of the LI, without boring the readers?** 

AND any it would be great if you have an pointers for **writing conflict between a MC and their friend without demonizing the friend and giving the readers the impression that there won't be any resolution for their relationship**.

(At this point, I'm considering cutting the subplot out completely. I'd rather get rid of it, if it means that I can't give it proper build up and resolution.)

&amp;#x200B;

\*None of this is to say that these tropes are necessarily bad. Most tropes, if written well, can be very entertaining to read. But for *my* fic, it wouldn't work thematically nor would it feel complete"
186,t3_gf510u,FanFiction,reading fanfic about irl people or dead people always makes me feel ashamed,"i always feel like they can see what I’m doing or that the dead people would be laughing at me from their graves or watching me as ghosts,, bad paranoia and shame aren’t a good mix. I’m finding it hard to google search fanfic atm because I always feel like someone could be watching. it’s really dumb. I’ve tried to think about it logically in my head but it doesn’t work"
187,t3_get4s5,FanFiction,Is there a 'magic phrase' you use to get comments?,"Some good fics, (I'm not just talking about my own writing) have hardly any comments.

Some people use the LHF comment request template but still get nothing.

Is there a magic trick that works for you to get engagement?

I'm talking from an AO3 perspective."
188,t3_gevti5,FanFiction,How to write a good redemption arc?,"For context, the character going through the redemption arc in my story didn’t do a lot of evil acts himself in the canon story, he was just on the evil side of the battle, though he was also a bit sadistic, since he liked watching his teammates die. He never really fought. My story takes a different path than the canon story, and him being redeemed instead of dying like he does in canon is one of them.
I’m mostly asking because looking over the current draft I have, the redemption arc wasn’t given much meat to it, if you know what I mean. It’s not part of the main plot of the story, so it was more like “Oh, he’s redeemed now. Moving on.” That’s not very interesting to read though. That’s why I’m asking for advice. I’ve never really done a redemption arc before; I tend to kill off my antagonists as well, but that’s also a bit bland."
189,t3_gekm59,FanFiction,My first fic hit 7k hits last night!,"My first fanfic, Toxic, a NSFW Harry Potter Dramione fic, hit 7k hits last night! And to think I just uploaded one of the last chapters... This is one of two long fics I'm working on, and I just had to share my achievement with you all. Without the continual support from this community, I never would've had the courage to post in the first place. I just wanted to celebrate. Thank you all, and keep writing!"
190,t3_geuooi,FanFiction,Is there a way to download ao3 fics without the author’s notes?,"As a prolific author myself, I certainly understand the value of having authors notes; but, for some reason that I seriously don’t understand, a large number of the writers in one of my favorite fandoms write spoilers for the ensuing chapter/fic in the AN and it really sucks being spoiled on the story. If there’s a way to download the fic without the notes that would help me not get constantly discouraged halfway through reading a fic. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I realize the solution would be to not read the authors notes but I download most fics to my kindle and due to the formatting I’ve ended up reading AN spoilers before realizing it"
191,t3_gfb019,FanFiction,Genderbending a Gay Couple,"Does anyone know the point of genderbending one character of a gay ship (specifically, the less dominant one in the relationship) but changing literally nothing else? Is the writer straightwashing or something? Obviously some fics are reasonable if the characters are entities without gender (Good Omens Crowley has presented as a woman) but why exclusively change the gender of a character who's in a gay ship when it contributes nothing to the story? Unless the character is trans or something like that where it actually contributes to the story, I don't see the point in doing it. Just wondering, some artist I like got flamed for genderbending a gender fluid character (she's not in the wrong obviously) and I just was curious about the difference between straight washing versus different representation."
192,t3_geas9a,FanFiction,You guys ever get that one idea...,"...Where it's the perfect fanfiction plot and you look it up because surely *someone* must have written about but you find out no-one has, and you decide to forget about it but you can't and it's stuck in your head for hours on end to the point where you go ""Fine, I'll do it myself.""

That is literally all my fanfiction.

Edit: I have 9 stories, none of them finished."
193,t3_geog5o,FanFiction,I finally finished the sequel to my longest fic!,"Back in September, I started writing what would end up being my longest fic ever, finishing it a 76k words. I mentioned a few times in my authors notes that I had ideas for sequels in the form of smaller stories, and after I uploaded the last chapter of the long fic, I started working on a sequel fic.

Life happened, though, and that got thrown to the back burner. I started a new fic in a new fanbase and immediately ran out of steam. Started another new fic and I’m trying to work with it, as I really like the concept of it. When I published the first chapter of it, I finally went back to the fic that had been sitting in my drafts for months, and I’m happy to say that after a few nights of “no more animal crossing until you finish this,” I managed to get it done, edit, and post it!

The reviews so far have made it all worth it. I was really, really intimidated by the thought of writing anything after I wrote my first  fic. As of now, my first fic is the highest kudos/comments/bookmarked/hit fic in the entire fanbase, and I was scared shitless that it would “ruin” the first fic, even when it was just a fun little one-shot, but all I’ve seen is positivity from my readers and :’)! It makes me happy to write for them, and I’m glad they had the patience to wait for me to come back when I was ready.♥️"
194,t3_gejkyu,FanFiction,my one shot fic just hit 100 views combined between ff.net &amp; ao3!!!,"this doesn't sound like a huge milestone but it kind of is to me since this was the first time i had written for this fandom. the fandom's really small as well so i wasn't really expecting much when i posted it, but it's been just shy of two weeks since i posted &amp; i'm already at 100 between the two sites i frequent!!!! it makes me feel really happy &amp; welcomed into this tiny community, especially since my take on the characters were a bit out of the norm, from what i had seen while browsing other works. i really wanna write more for the fandom now &amp; i hope they enjoy it just as much!!!"

Like one person commented on the first chapter and dropped off, which is like, yeah ok that's the way it goes. 

Anyway, I posted the last chapter, and mentioned in the note at the end that I'd thought about adding an epilogue. I got three comments really quick just basically going ""yes, write more!"" 

Internally, I'm like ""really, guys? Really?""

Anyway, c'est la vie XD I'll go write my epilogue, I guess"
196,t3_gex40i,FanFiction,Writer's block alert!,"Hey! This is my first post and I am not very great at grammar because I'm on mobile, so feel free to roast me.

When I was young.. well young(er).. I have had this little hobby of mine to writing stories, mainly for myself and occasionally my best friend (she's a really great artist and has the same hobby as me). Sometimes it was just small ridiculous stories, while others I became so dedicated to turning it into a book.

However I started to not feel as inspired as I use to be, leaving me with many, many blank pages and unfinished ideas that I considered to be trash to this day. Even though I currently have a story idea (that I will not share) and I really want to do it! But it's been days, which turned into weeks and finally a few months, and I STILL don't know how to start it when I have a practically a whole story plot in mind.

It drives me crazy and I miss being able to just do whatever makes me feel happy, regardless it was fanfiction or not. I don't know if there is something wrong with me or it's just me, I have no clue... I am not as good as some of the other authors who are able to create multiple chapters and I can barely get started on mine...

Oh well, that was just my little rant! I hope I didn't bore any of you.. I'm new at reddit and I'm trying hard to get use to the whole thing."

I said that I would participate in all seven days of my ship week by the end of May.

Multiple irl factors have left me tired and drained, and when I think about writing, my creativity goes literally everywhere but here. Things I'd rather be writing. A bunch of silly one-shots. The long-term project I'm waiting on after this is done. It's almost like my subconscious doesn't want to write this.

And yet, I feel the need to keep my word. I told a bunch of people I'd do something, so the right thing to do is to go and do it.

199,t3_geodps,FanFiction,I wrote over 30k words in 2 weeks and I can't seem to stop. Help!,"So with all this free time in confinement due to epidemic, I finally started writing a fanfic. First after about 6-8 years of hiatus. I had this story in my mind since I finished a game and I imagined what If scenarios as well as continuations of the original story.

This damn thing sat inside of my head for almost 4 years. And I couldn't bear that while retaining my sanity. I kept going (every night) over some scenes and over and over and over again. I just had to write it down. 

So I decided to finally get this thing off my head and use some of the spare time I had. And now... I can stop. Really. I'm stuck with my laptop and I keep writing and writing and I don't see an end to it. 

I wrote over 30k words in about 2 weeks and planned so many things to it, that I think this gonna be hella long fic. Does any of you have sometimes similar problems? Or am I the biggest weirdo without life, taking my laptop even to the bathroom?"
200,t3_gexldz,FanFiction,Nervous about one of my commentors..,"I'm fairly new to AO3, A site I've been stalking for years but have only just gotten an account on about a week or so ago. 
I've got like three or four people who comment on my fics, which I have a combined 15 of in separate fandoms, and this is very reasonable, since I've only just started, but I've got a problem that may seem ridiculous but I am nervous about it. 
I have eight fanfictions a fandom that's not very popular (none of the random I post to are popular, funnily enough) and I have a commentor who has not given me any trouble, not in that way, but I'm Worried about losing their support when I post more chapters to one of my fanfics. 
They're very much a fan of a member of the band that my fics are based on, and I am too, they're my second favorite member, but I plan posting a chapter focusing on my favorite member, and I'm Scared that will lose their support since I don't think they're a fan of that member, at least, not as much as the other one. 
I'm sorry if this is rambling or im being ridiculous but I don't want to lose a commentor (I basically live on them) but I don't want to mold my stories just to fit what they like. I have stories and plan on chapters involving that member, but I'm still so stupidly nervous about it. I Also don't want them to write a comment that's not good. I don't do well with criticism. 
Am I being stupid? Any Advice, please?"
201,t3_ged9rf,FanFiction,Quantity of Feedback =/= Quality of Writing,"I wanted to bring this up because I just discovered this sub (hello!) and I recently binged all the work of this fanfic author who is just... an incredible writer. I'm really picky to the point that I really don't read much fanfiction (more than one or two grammatical slips will have me hitting the back button before you can say 'typo'), but when you find a good author...man. It's like, this person should be published, right? Why aren't they publishing novels???  


And then I look at the kudos and hit count and I'm like...20 KUDOS??? That's it? On this 30k masterpiece? It's gen fic (no ship) so like, I kind of get, but still! Damn!   


On the flip side, I've encountered works with thousands of kudos/tens of thousands of hits that were just unreadable to me.   


I know I personally can get obsessed with feedback on my own writing, so I try to remind myself that getting no (or very little feedback) doesn't mean I suck. It really depends on the fandom, the ship, and idk, the relative alignment of the moon and the sun, probably. Don't get discouraged if you pour your heart into something that doesn't get much feedback. Someone out there is probably losing their mind over it.

203,t3_geyamz,FanFiction,Percy Jackson. Long Rant about my issues as a writer and reader of fanfiction.,"This is not ment to offend anyone, however here are some of my problems as a Percy Jackson writer. Issue 3 onward is about the reading, there's honestly not that many. 

Issue 1. God be dammned Prophecys

How the Hades do you write propehcys. First of all, they're cryptic as heck and I find if you have a certain story line and can't create a prophecy to go with it you edit the entire storyline to fit it. That annoys me deeply as I end up having to take the fic down and  completely scrap it. That's not even mentioning the rhyming, multiple meanings and false interpretations that you somehow have to force into a few lines! My problems with prophecy in fics is just that they're so god damn annoying to write around and for!

Issue 2. Genderbending.

We all get to the time in our lives when we grow to enjoy writing genderbent characters, Percy Jackson, is the universal exception. I'm not sure if this is just me, but I've wrote gender bent versions of many characters and none have annoyed me so much as 'Persephone' Jackson, 'Thor' Grace and 'Nicole' Di Angelo, or whatever the Tartarus you want to call them. 
I've never had any issues, until it came to writing about these three genderbends. Thor Grace, ideal is that he's arrogant and his character slowly morphs into being more mature and humble, like Thalia. Problem is, the hunters are a big part 9f the change and with him being male, that's a no go!

Genderbent Thalia also means relations to the hunters are harder to explain and write about as they'd have no inside connections as long as you want to stick to the storyline with Bianca dying and Nicole not joining the hunters 

Genderbent Percy isn't so bad, I'll admit it. However I cannot stand her being with any 'Andrew Chase' and honestly, Wise Guy doesn't have that much of a ring to it!
I mean no offence, but I don't do Lesbian relationships or Fem on Fem. I accept it and all, but don't enjoy writing it so that rules out the Legendary Percabeth ship that makes Percy Jackson so good!

Genderbent Nico..... it just doesn't sound write to me, I don't enjoy writing it and it just doesn't fit in with any plot line I write, ever!

Issue 3. The immortals.

Holy Chaos, Hades and Tartarus bundled together in a single crib. If you're several, SEVERAL, thousands of years old wouldn't you learn common sense! How can Percy have committed the thefts, when he has NO idea who he is?!?

Secondly, they're all powerful immortals. NOT KICKED PUPPIES! How could you, fanfiction writers of reddit not take advantage of their Immortality and twist them! Thos makes my heart ache, where are all the fanfictions where the immortals listen to their common sense!

Thirdly, the titans, primordial and Olympians. They. Are. IMMORTALS! I ge5 it, Ouranus neglected his kids badly, Kronos killed his father, and ate his kids and the Olympians overthrew Kronos.

I. Get. It.

But for Chaos' sake! They're immortals, where does holding grudges get you if you're immortal? It gets you too arrogant to accept an enemie's help, even if it's to save your own skin! If the Olympians has gotten over their grudge and the Titan's theirs, the maybe there would have been peace and I dont know, less Pain!
Where are all the writers trying to fix this, Reddit!

Issue 4. Chaos fanfictions.

For once, writers of reddit. For once o would like to see a Chaos fic not resulting in Percy getting betrayed or killed or heartbroken or in any damaged!
That's not my main problem however. 

My main problem is that the majority of Chaos fics, bring back the dead. In none of the ones I've read, do any of the demigods react like they should. Also let's think in the case of Zoë, do you not think people would notice an entire frickin constellation disappearing! 

And Bianca, didn't she go for rebirth, and wouldn't Hades have noticed his kid disappearing regardless!

Luke Castellen, If I was him. I would've fled as fast as my legs could take me in the direction of the Lethe for Rebirth.

I'm tempted not to mention why the ships bother me but, this is my rant time. So what the Hades! Luke and Zoë, Luke and Bianca. Percy and Zoë, Percy and Bianca. Others and Zoë, Others and Bianca.

Does it occur to you, fellow fanfic writers that both were sworn maidens, died as hunters, and likely carry those values still!?! Why the Tartarus would you ship them with Boys! Pr with anyone for that matter!

Another thing, in most Chaos fics, I see no mention, reference or hint at the rest or entirety of the Primordial council, and when Chaos is mentioning them it's with no slight hint of regret, sadness or any emotion at all! I mean what the Hades! Sure they messed up, but they're his kids! 

Readers of Reddit, what happened to the kind Primordial councils I saw in one maybe two Chaos fics? Why the evil Primordials hellbent on killing their father, taking over earth, or destroying the universe. Again, common sense says that would lead to tour own destruction. But just Whyyyy.

So I went looking for my all time favorite story regarding Percy Jackson today, titled *Nine Times Percy Jackson Saved a Friend*.

so yea, i'll read fandom blind, just any time travel story where the timeline is altered or something similar to the above"
213,t3_geujoi,FanFiction,Romance Tips?,So I’ve started plotting out a GOT fan fiction involving a romance between an OC and a character from the show. My problem is romance has never been my thing so I don’t want to make the whole story “I love you”. Any tips...note idk if this is the place to post this but it’s worth a shot.
214,t3_geubj7,FanFiction,"Hey, so I’m writing a fanfic but...","... I’m not sure if it’s something people will enjoy reading. I’m certainly having a good time writing it (using it as stress relief, even though that’s the opposite of what my character is getting). 

The fanfic takes place in Transformers Prime with the idea that after creating Darkmount, the Decepticons took over the planet instead of hunting down the Autobots right away. As a result, any captured humans were taken to energon mines to mine energon. The main character is a young mother with her two year old daughter who ran away from her abusive husband  and hid in the woods only days before the invasion. It’s essentially about how the young mother is trying to survive the apocalypse with her child while trying to avoid being captured by aliens or dying (at least until her daughter is old enough to take care of herself... main character is not in the best mindset). Meanwhile, a environmental disease is being spread due to the energon mining called the ‘Blues’ by the humans (AKA, energon poisoning but appearing as sepsis and organ failure) and both mother and child catch it. Mother tries to find a cure (wanted to be a research specialized in blood before having child and has some basic knowledge), some body horror happens, then it eventually leads up to a rebellion forming, consisting of the uncaptured humans.  Actual transformers character will be introduced later in the story (the beginning only having Vehicons, a name dropped character, and two actually characters (who are barely there for two chapters before disappearing again)). 

That’s all I’m willing to discuss at the moment but it’s currently at 12 chapters and 56120 words. 

Does this sound interesting or no? I’m planning on putting it onto fanfiction.net and AO3 when I’m closer to being done with it, in case I lose motivation and run out of ideas (don’t want to abandon it after I start publishing the chapters, I hate disappointing people)."
215,t3_gejnn6,FanFiction,NSFW : How do you write about a character healing from rape,"TW: Rape/non-con 

I'm writing this Fanfic for a friend's birthday, which includes a plot related rape scene as a form of revenge by the main villain.

Based on the friend's request, somewhere after that in the fic there should be a sex scene between the traumatised character and another character that knows about the rape. In which it should be healing and end sweetly.

Then a revenge on the rapist is executed. Although my main concern is how to make a character heal from a rape scene without having them magically forget it or down playing the trauma.

I want it to be a feel good fic. A hurt/comfort type.

Any advice or suggestions is welcomed. Although It's really unlikely that I can remove either scenes since it's a gift for my friend and it's supposed to fit their liking."
216,t3_gen63v,FanFiction,Recommendations/Discussion for HEROIC OCs/Self-Inserts?,"I wasn't sure what my first reddit post should be, but then thought getting some good fanfic might be a good idea!  


So, what I'm looking for are OCs/Self-Inserts that are aligned with ""good"" and have heroic nature. I know that there are plenty of My Hero Academia fics, but most of them either go for the more self-involved angle or rebellious angle for becoming a hero.

Something where the character actually feels inspired by the role of heroism or doing good would be refreshing. Or say, someone who is in Naruto and uses Ninjitsu for good and not just survival/plot.

As you can see, I've been craving for some heroics, lol. I've been reading non-harem Spider-Man crossovers to bide my time. 

Fandom doesn't matter as long as the OC/Self-insert is likeable and not just smug like some DC OCs I've seen. Discussion about heroic OCs or the lack of them are also welcome! 

Thanks!"

222,t3_gefmbn,FanFiction,"Is using Chan, Kun, or San in fanfiction cringy if you're not Japanese?","(Hopefully, I used the right Flair, If not my apologies)

Now let me clarify, the fandom I write for is a JRPG and it's a game that's was made in Japan and then translated and released in the U.S. Now even in the English translation of the game the characters still use honorifics, like they don't overuse them, but they're still used quite a bit in the English translation.

So would you consider me cringy if I write my fanfiction and include honorifics in dialogue every once in a while especially for characters who use them a lot? I really don't wanna seem cringy but Honorifics are used a lot in the game and some character's names just don't sound right without them.

So no-no or it's fine as long as I don't overuse them?"
223,t3_geoo0i,FanFiction,Question about FFN explicit content,"Hello! I am aware of FFN not accepting explicit content, but the only discussions around it I have seen on here are related to smut. When it comes to violence, how much is too explicit for the website?

224,t3_getxsi,FanFiction,Cross-over Fanfic idea (GF x X-Men) (don’t know what flair to put for this).,"Stan Pines from Gravity Falls is a mutant and is recruited for X-Men First Class. It can fit the timeline because Stan was kicked out of his home in 1962, the same year as the Cuban Missile Crisis (which also took place in October while Stan was most likely kicked out between the months of March to June). He can become a drifter again once it’s over but maybe keep in contact with the others. Don’t know what his ‘ability’ would be but if I could pick, I would say ‘Bad Luck’, with more ‘bad luck’ occurring when he’s upset and/or angry (kind of like he was just before being kicked out, with his girlfriend cheating on him and breaking up with him while his brother wanted to move away, along with no one ever believing Stan would amount to anything... a lot of stuff to make Stan angry and upset during 1962... ) and is controlled via his emotions. 

...it would certainly have a lot of angst (especially if Stan can’t figure out if his ‘Bad luck’ caused something to happen (like the portal to suck up Ford or the bullet that hit Professor Xavier and paralyzed him) or if it was just something that was bound to happen)...

...And just imagine how Bill Cipher would react to it all during Weirdmageddon...

225,t3_getpvd,FanFiction,Can Mpreg Actually Be Convincing?,"I'll cut right to it. I was going to do an ER fanfic (anyone remember that show?) that involves a prank mpreg. Something happens earlier with another character (Benton) and he has to have his apendix removed. The anesthesia causes him to think his surgical collgues are pregnant. After someone Benton confided in lets it slip out, Carter decides to have some fun with it. Fake baby bump and everything. But, I also thought about what would happen if he actually were expecting, but just didn't want to tell anyone.

One, would that even be a good idea to even do that with this sort of thing? With this being a fairly accurate medical show to begin with, so there is no point in which mpreg was canon.

Two, if I do this, how can I make it believable? Convincing? I know, it's generally not either, but if anyone has suggestions on what to do that would make it so, I'm open for them. I was thinking of a condition called PMDS, persistent müllerian duct syndrome, in which, occasionally, a male will retain some female reproductive organs during development, usually internal and almost always involving surgery to lower the testis. It is a thing. Google it, but don't look at images. Trust me. I'm not entirely sure to what extent it cause pregnancy in men, however, but it's a start? Again, I'm open for suggestions."

On the latest chapter they said my fic is 'a ray of sunshine' and \*curls up into a ball and cries from happiness\* how the hell am I supposed to reply to that?!

In my fic I sometimes use right-justified text for various things such as text exchanges or background sounds like song lyrics, but on FFN the only options the editor gives me are left and center-justification. 

Is there any kind of html editor I'm missing on FFN, or a way I can just insert the HTML code to get this to work? It's not the worst thing in the world to lose this feature but I'd rather not have to get creative with reformatting if I can avoid it."

I've orphaned all the fics for that fandom and even though it does kinda suck I'm glad I did it.

239,t3_ge3cs4,FanFiction,For writers feeling inadequate,"These are a few things I’ve been reminding myself of as I struggle with feelings of inadequacy when it comes to my writing, and I thought they might help others who also compare their work to others or become obsessed with not receiving an unattainable quantity of positive feedback. 

I’m with you. I’m still there off and on every day. I’m just sharing a couple thoughts in hopes of helping.

1.  With few exceptions, most of the writing I enjoy most could be said to have glaring flaws, some of which I see clearly myself.

JRR Tolkien is an incredible genius at world building, but his lengthy descriptions of trees and shit in Lord of the Rings are tedious as hell. Still, one of the best series of all time.

Great Expectations has way too many fucking words, but damn if I don’t just feel for Pip every step of the way and think Estella and Mrs. Havisham are two do the most captivating characters in all of literature. 

Twilight - I can’t even figure out what the fuck is good about it, but I recently re-read it as an adult (well, skimmed) and fuck! Even that was good!

2. If all writers had the same skills and strong points, reading would be boring and redundant and so many perspectives would be lost. The three examples above also show me this - each author has totally different strong suits (even if we can’t figure out what Stephanie Meyer’s is).

3. The diversity of perspectives and topics in wiring is what makes it it enjoyable and popularity does not equal quality. I also like to equate it with music when I feel like giving up. 

If you like any band that is not considered “popular,” imagine if that artist had just given up and said - welp, my music is not top 40 material so I’m never making music again. Hell no, that would be awful!  Also think of it this way - if there were only songs about love or only joy or only heartbreak - what a tragedy! 

I’m no Tolkien or Dickens or even a Meyer. I’m halfway through writing a foursome between my favorite video game characters (for fuck’s sake), but there are some people out there who like my writing, so I chug on and keep the faith, and I hope you, dear author, can do the same.

This has been my TED talk."
240,t3_ge99yy,FanFiction,Can someone explain to me what the 'Freeform' tag on AO3 is all about?,"I've seen this tag lately on fics within my fandom, usually it looks like '(pairing) - freeform' or '(fandom) - freeform'

I haven't heard the term 'freeform' used in the fanfiction world until now, can someone explain to me what it means?"
241,t3_geek84,FanFiction,Can a female character prefer pants to dresses/skirts without having body issues?,"I want to write a female character who prefers pants and hates wearing dresses or skirts (basically a tomboy), but I don’t want it to be because she’s too self-conscious/ashamed of her body or that she’s shy or sheltered or some other issue.

Often times in media, tomboys are portrayed as not liking feminine things because of reasons like these and the only cure is to get all dolled up in makeup and dresses and embrace their inner femininity. I see it a lot in teen movies and stuff.

I don’t like this trope. It implies that there is something inherently wrong with girls rejecting femininity and only by embracing it will they become confident and happy. That having a more masculine identity is holding them back from becoming something better. That their preference is caused by something negative. 

I don’t doubt that there may be some truth in this for some girls/women and if embracing femininity makes them feel better, then that’s fine. 

I also don’t have anything against feminine women at all. I still find them attractive and lovely. I simply have a thing for tomboys and the idea of girls going against social norms (as cliche as that may be).

In short, I want to know if a girl can dislike for dresses and skirts, but also be social and confident about their body. 

It’s not that they’re afraid of wearing dresses, they just don’t like or feel comfortable wearing them."
242,t3_gehbit,FanFiction,"Hey, any tips for a mediocre fanfiction writer?","I guess this isn’t a question, I’m just seeking for advice.

I would say that I’m a lot better than wattpad fanfic writers in general, but I still would like to know how I can improve on writing as a whole. 

Having advice for romance fanfiction is highly preferred, since that’s most of what I write 😓"
243,t3_gf0o9r,FanFiction,Series of Unpopular Opinion,"I've been writing for almost 10 years now for a lot of different fandoms, and i just need a space to vent, specifically regarding the types of comments i get.

1. Not every author's first language is english, so excuse me for not having perfect 800 SAT english. Some of us are just busy high schooler/college student/working class people with english as their second or even third language,  who wanted to express ourselves in the one language people all around the world share to garner more readers and would probably improve slower than other language-wise. ""The story is great, but your grammar is off putting"" Fuck you get the fuck off your fucking high horse.
2. I write long stories, averaging on 6000+ words per updates/oneshot. I did not write that much, do so much research and planning and effort out of my time and create this ***free*** to consume piece to only get ""Good update. thanks"" comment, especially when I asked for feedback. I get writing comment is hard, but here's what, maybe adding a little ""I love this part!"" or ""I'm curious to see how X part will go!"" gives author so much more to help them know where to take the story. There was this one fanfic posting site that I love, where to comment, you need to insert a minimum of 10 words before you could post, everywhere else needs to adapt that.
3. And if I hate these sort of commenters, I absolutely abhorred the ones who spammed the ""Good update. thanks"" across all of your chapters. I get so excited seeing a lot of notification in my inbox only to see basically a robot spamming my comment section. Even in school you were thought the introduction-1 or 2 major points-closing format of writing, why don't you utilize that and stop wasting people's time. I try to reply to every comments I got, but those ones I blatantly ignore and if i'm on a particular website, just report as spam and move on.
4. ""Hello, when will this fic gets updated?"" ""I miss this fic, please update soon!"" Appreciated reminders, will be replied with sincere regret that writers block do happen or if real life stuff gets in the way but will become a prime motivator to write something soon. ""So is this every going to be updated or not"" ""Daily reminder to update this"" and fucking worst of all, in a fic just update 5 minutes ago, word per word: ""Thanks. Update soon"". Fuck right off, your barnyard animal who absolutely never learn manners, fuck you pay me, this shit's fucking free and a hobby who gave you the fucking right.
5. ""Oh no i commented too long"" Please, please know this is probably the best thing to happen to me. Comment until the word limit is reached, I don't care. I want those long comments, I love seeing feedback to know which aspect of the story you like, what to improve or make clearer and what you don't like or think is not right so i can fix that. No comment is ever too long, even if they're mostly rambling.
6. The only short, less than 5 words comment I will actually appreciate are those meme-ing comments or funny incoherent ones, because at least it looks like you're a real human who reads my fic and not a spambot by the website to make it look like they have more visitor. You know who you are.

Guess that covers most of it. Feel free to agree or disagree. Now, this next part is more of a AITA territory for special cases i still don't know how i should feel but i'll type in anyway:

1. One specific scenario that happened a while ago: Commenter gushed over the possibility of ship X with side character A and C. Problem is, I don't ship X, I ship A with character B and preferred ship Z. After a while, someone brought over to my attention that the same commenter had created what is basically the same fic with premises as mine, only that ship X is the main focus and they broke off ship Z. I'd say it's plagiarism, but they aren't copying it exactly with the main ship, just made the focus be their ship. Their comments had some people calling them out on this, and after I DM them, they instead turned the story private. Just how fucked up you gotta be to just stole things like that because i won't include your ship?
2. I've had some rare occasion where people will tell me my fic inspired them to write something, and i've always said I'm okay with it. Some are even kind enough to link me their work and i have to say i'm always flattered since most writes better than me. But then in one occasion, again, brought to my attention by a reader, someone blatantly plagiarized some of my dialogues in their fic, by like 15% or so. When called out, they said it was original, even though I literally put both our fics in two different tabs to see that it's exactly word for word a copy, and in the end, they blocked and privated their story, presumably after people had started to notice as well. Was that plagiarism or just plain asshole-ism? I don't mind you translating, taking part of my fics and all, just tell the fucking truth. I'm not even asking for a credit in your fic, just ask me first.

For all that fanfic writing is a hobby, it could be so damned draining at times."
244,t3_gef5li,FanFiction,DAE get really caught up in the different possibilities for the story?,"Like, you had a general idea for how x would occur when you began...but then you realize it could also unfold in some other way. That other way also appears to be pretty spicy, but is it more spicy than the original? But wait, here’s another idea! 

Then repeat until you have a million possible iterations of a scene that all accomplish the same narrative goal.

And you can’t seem to come up with an idea that somehow trumps your other ideas, so you’re just kinda left with a bunch of great possible directions to take the story? All of which you’d like to see?

Basically, the opposite of not knowing where to go with the story."
245,t3_gefn7g,FanFiction,What’s kidfic? Kid!Fic??,"I mean I feel like I have gathered enough to know but can someone explain it better? I wanted to write a fic with Lilo (Lilo &amp; Stitch) and her friends and was told to tag it as kidfic when I post it. But like, what does that mean? Kidfic supposed to be from the perspective of kids but does that mean like the world is explained differently or that people don’t use big words kind of thing? And kid!fic is when they get turned into kids or AU kind of deal?"
246,t3_geoarv,FanFiction,"How do I kill a character, or at the very least put them in danger, when their main defining trait is that they can see and do anything with no consequences?","I've asked what I wanted to in the title, but I'll add some context here- though keep in mind, it will still be rather vague due to spoilers. Put simply, this story is set in the bnha universe, and the character's quirk is 'quirk generation'; basically, he can create any quirk he wants. When this was found out, he was taken by a branch of the government to be experimented on and eventually tortured as they tried to force him to work for them. Eventually, he created the right quirks to make him immune to whatever they wanted to do to him, and so he escaped.

However by this point he had gained an intense hatred for humanity, and his only reason for just not snapping everybody out of existence is that he wants people to suffer- and he's also lauding around as a faux-God.

At the start of the story, he decides to give humanity once last chance, by giving a quirkless girl a quirk, and seeing what she chooses to do with her new-found power.

The issue I'm having is that there's no real way for this character to come under threat, since they can see and do whatever they want. There's no way to hurt them, or trick them; they are infallible- but for the plot to progress the way I want it to, they need to fallible.

Edit: I've figured out what it is I'm going to do; I decided to take the advice one of you gave me on making it so those that he interferes with, he can't see the future of. Thanks for the help 👌"

Now for how to play this game. :)

**Posting fics for review:**

* Select a passage from a fic you want a comment/review on.  
* There is a soft **limit of 500 words**.  [Not your whole fic.](https://i.imgur.com/NTb9Mwu.gif)
* Top level comments should be fic snippets. 
* First line should be `Fandom | Title | Rating | Link - AO3, FFN, etc.`
* Copy and paste your fic tidbit directly to the thread. (Unless...)
 * Fics rated Mature or Explicit are welcome, 
  * **BUT do not post plain text** of scenes that contain explicit sexual situations,  extreme depictions of violence, or underage content.  **Links** to these fics, with appropriate tags/warnings, are acceptable.
 * If the specific scene you've chosen to post contains none of this, please warn those who might go link-clicking about the content in the rest of the fic.

* If you, for whatever reason, would not like the review also put on your actual fic, please say so.

* **If you contribute a fic, you must leave a review for someone else!**

---

Formatting example:

**Fandom | Title | Rating | Link to offsite**

(new line, double enter) *Any applicable warnings*

(new line, double enter) Your fic text.

---

**Leaving reviews:**

* Above all, be kind.
*  30+ words when leaving reviews, please.  This is to promote fair play and level the field. If you want to ramble on from there, go right ahead!
* Quoting parts of the fic *does not* count toward your review word count.
* **It is highly encouraged to review in this thread and also copy/paste it to the actual fic or chapter they've linked.**
* If you see something that doesn't have a review yet, please try to give it a read to spread the love around.
* If you have the time, reviewing more than one fic would be a thoughtful thing to do.  If you're here, you'd probably like to get more than one, so why not give an extra or three yourself?  This community thrives when people contribute to it, and the more people participate, the more people we tend to get in these threads.

**Tips and tricks for leaving a positive review:**

When a line catches your eye, quote it and say what you liked about it.

If there's an overarching theme or technicality the author did well, point it out.

If you get a nifty theory about where the plot's going, share it!  Try to keep your phrasing positive: ""I think X is going to rob the train, that'd be cool!"" rather than demanding: ~~""X and Y should bang now and that's how it's going to end or you, the author, are wrong.""~~  *Bzzzt, wrong answer!*

Be clear about *why* you liked certain parts.  Elaborate if you can!

If the fic made you feel something, most of the time, that would be a good thing to add.

You may have no clue about the fandom, but did you get a good sense of a character, or the scenery, or the plot, the action, the feeling of the scene, the interactions, the dialogue?  I'm sure they'd like to know!

And, honestly, if you feel the need to get your squee on in here, I really doubt there's going to be objections to the occasional ""asdhgdasdfsadf"" key smash or emojis as decorative additions to your review. :D

Don't forget to have fun!"

252,t3_ge36i0,FanFiction,Do you ever feel disappointed that an author has never once responded to any of your comments?,"There’s an author I’ve been following for almost five years now who’s written a handful of fics I really enjoy and I’ve left a bunch of long, glowing reviews on those stories. The overwhelming majority of comments she gets are only a couple of sentences long but I tend to make mine pretty detailed in general and sometimes spend hours typing them, not just for her stories but for other authors whose works I enjoy too. It’s just how I’ve always done it because I like to tell them specifically what I enjoyed and thought worked well as well as give constructive criticism if I have any.

However, in those five years, I’ve never received a single reply to any of them. I probably wouldn’t care if she was now inactive or didn’t ask for her readers to leave reviews in an author’s note at the end of every chapter, and if it was just a couple of times then I wouldn’t even think anything of it, but it’s always been a consistent thing. I’m not upset about it and I’m honestly not looking for a “thank you” even if my wording may seem like it, but I guess I just feel disappointed that I tend to go above and beyond what many others do for leaving reviews and after all that effort and time, I’ve still never heard anything back. It almost feels like I did something wrong for some reason, even though I don’t know what that could possibly be because I think that even my criticisms were fair and polite. Then again, maybe she doesn’t reply to reviews at all so I’m probably not the only one. I’ll continue reading her stories though because I really like her style and she’s good at what she does.

Has anyone else ever felt like this before regarding this kind of thing?"

254,t3_geazcf,FanFiction,Writing Dilemma,"Hey everyone, this is my first post on Reddit.

I'm currently writing a story which I am so pumped to share with everyone.

The thing is, despite my usual call for honest feedback (because I always believe in self-improvement as a writer), my story hasn't been getting many comments from readers. And while every single comment so far has been positive (which I wholeheartedly appreciate), the fact that I've been getting so few comments is kind of disheartening. It feels as if my story isn't resonating with readers.

That brings me to my point, I'm unsure of how to feel about this situation. Am I an attention-seeking harlot? Or are my concerns legitimate?

There's this movie that I really really liked, but unfortunately it's so little known that there's, like, no fanfics for it. I *would* write one myself, but I'm not very confident in my writing skills, and plus it's more fun to read when you don't know what's going to happen. 

I have some pictures from the movie from the specific scene that I really enjoyed watching and wanted a fanfic done on. If anyone could help me with that, that would be fantastic! 
(By the way, you don't have to have watched the movie; I've watched it multiple times and can give you the details you need, if that makes sense? And also the movie is called 'The Son of Bigfoot', made in 2017. [Weird title, I know, just go with it xD])

I'm basically worried because I didn't hear from the author first if it was okay or even if they wanted fan art and I've heard of some authors getting mad about derivative works of their fanfic. 

Has anyone had an experience with an author getting mad that you made fan art for them and posted it before they okayed it or am I overthinking this?"

With everyone currently on lockdown, I decided that to pass the time I'd get back into Fanfiction writing. (Which is something I haven't done since 2013, believe it or not.) While my writing style has evolved drastically as compared to when I was 13, I wanted to know if there was a kind of technique of method of getting more feedback (comments specifically) on the stories you right. I switched from FF.net to AO3 and I prefer the latter, and I'm genuinely surprised at how many hits I was able to get. Still, I'm always looking for ways I can improve and get these stories out to a larger audience.

266,t3_ge6qgs,FanFiction,"Fluffy romance, the right way.","Here are my tips for writing fluffy F/M. I say that unless you can pull it off well, avoid smut in fluffed up romance. A lot of smut is erotic, lustful stuff that really clashes with the light, ‘makes you smile’ fluff. 


1. They notice when each other is upset and cares for them.
2. They look out for one another and respect each other.
3. They hold hands, especially in public.
4. They kiss softly but not make out.
5. They cuddle playfully.
6. They share lingering hugs. Arms wrapped around the others’ waist. 
7. They compliment each other and make one another feel attractive and loved.
8. They won’t lie or fight. When they disagree, they talk it through. They will always tell the truth.
9. They don’t flirt with anyone else or each other.
10. They treat each other like adults, but act playfully with each other.
11. They remind each other how much they mean to them and how much they love them. They aren’t afraid to say that they never want to lose each other.

A few stereotypes but still sexy:

12. The guy lets the girl wear one of his shirts (it is just plain cute!).
13. The man looks at her as if saying ‘are you okay?’ with a concerned look on his face, whenever she is hurt he helps her get up.
14. The guy pretends he is fine so that he can look after her without being tied down, even if something is bothering him. 
15. He holds hands with her and makes other girls jealous for her; he kisses her in front of their friends and makes her feel lucky.

Changes in personality:

16. Friends notice that they are often in a good mood.
17. They do everything together.
18. They are competitive.
19. They try to teach each other things.
20. They are positive and uplifting towards each other. 


If anyone has any other thoughts about the dynamic between lovers in fluff, please add it in! I’d love to see your comments."
267,t3_geey8s,FanFiction,Help with a League of legends plotline,"Good morning guys, how are you doing?

I hope everyone it's alright and safe.

I'm asking for help to my League of Legends fanfiction in Taric's POV before he became the Protector, so many stuff I had enough room to imagine how was his life when he was a Demacian Knight. At the moment I have a plot idea that while I like the concept, I'm not sure if it could fit at the same time in the lore.

My idea is this. I want Taric's father to force him to marry to one noble's daughter, this because he had a promise to keep with his dead wife (and keep in mind this isn't canon since we don't know about his family) and wants to his son to be an honourable knight. And of course, he wants to become a noble so he can rank up his position in the kingdom, and at the same time his son's rumours about his dishonour, disoyalty, etc could end. I also like the concept that his father isn't perhaps such an honourable Knight.

However, is this a good plotline if in lore Taric and his family aren't nobles? Is too much out of the lore if his father maybe isn't that honourable since the king, some noble families knows that his family follows the countries ideologies?

Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you.

Stay safe and have a lovely day."

I’m laying here in my bed this morning having just read a comment that yet again reminds me why we share the things we create. 
Don’t confuse this with publishing for likes, but do understand that there is something in receiving positive comments that just make you sigh and smile. My heart is full this morning because all those times I wrote and re-wrote until 3 in the morning worked! People read it and it makes sense, it makes them laugh or swoon or smile, makes them happy and frustrated, they FEEL! Ugh, knowing that I can make people feel, when they read my stories is a the highest praise... 

“To find that in your words not only soothed my mind but lifted my spirits and lightened my heart. Your writings were inspiring and I thank you for taking the time to share them, even when all appears dark and foreboding.”

Readers, you do not know how much we love you. You’re the reason we edit and re-read and damn it, re-read/write again haha.

275,t3_ge165n,FanFiction,Sick of Deku/Harem,"Every time I look up any Midoriya pairing on AO3, I have to sift through three dozen harem fics with about 17 different girls gunning for Deku. I won't point fingers, but certain stories on the site defiintely kick started the whole fad, and it's getting kinda tiresome for me.

I don't have an inhernet issue with harem stories in general, but only if they're done right. And a lot of them, imo, aren't. The real issue, i feel, is that a lot of them try to tell their own unique story, but the dozen or so chapters of harem shenanigans get in the way. I'm all too happy to read someone's take on a story, with their own plotlines and stuff, but sometimes it needs to be one or the other. Especially when the chapters are only like, 2-3k words each, and they're getting drip fed to the readers.

I don't mind if it's just a story about the harem, but when there's the side plots of girls being added, as well as their original storyline, it bogs it down a bit. Something really interesting can come up in the story, but then there's about five chapters of romantic development slowing it down.

And that's just when it's only Deku that the girls are after. Some have additional relationships amongst the other girls in the harem. Perfectly fine, but when that starts to not only take away from the main plot of the story, as well as any focus or development of Midoriya (because of course, he's often got a crap ton of his own issues to sift through), it becomes a problem. Because not only has the story slowed down for Midoriya's romantic development, there's then the addtional pairings bogging it down even more.

Again, I don't have an issue with harem stories in general. But there's just so many of them now, it's burying all the single pairing stories, and personally I prefer the single pairing over the harem.

I get that this is personal taste, but I just needed to get it off my chest."

Renaru, my MC, his whole arc is trying to not overwhelm himself, with the last chapter hammering home that he can LITERALLY detonate the country if he has an intense meltdown. I'm not talking about this being a one-time thing. He gets overwhelmed by everything pressuring him. He's just a kid with Quirk Palsy being carted around like he's some miracle.

Then he does a bad thing (to him.) to his girlfriend Momo, who he's head over heels in love with. I've introduced the fact that he's kind of a bastard child of my version of Masaru (A fashion mogul.) and his mother, Mitsuki (Former model turned office worker.) which is something Momo's extended family DOES NOT like. So... one question... I have a bit of a skeleton of an arc planned...

1. Momo's family is involved aside from her mother. (Her mother supports the relationship.)
2. They don't like my MC due to his bastard status.
3. He already gave Momo a promise ring, so she's currently trying to hide all evidence of their 'engagement'. (Poorly.)
4. Her extended family finds out and badda-bing, badda-boom, we have the climax, where they want him to prove his love by...

And that's where I hit a wall. I don't know what he'd do or say, or even if I want him to do anything or not. What would a superpowered society make him do to prove his love without it being super-cheesy? Like getting pelted by shit and eggs or forced to do dirty work?

I'm writing a Peter Parker fic and I need some ideas on how to refer to him. It feels too redundant to keep writing ""Peter did this"" or Peter sees that"". I also hate the overzealous use of ""the boy"" as well so definitely not that.

Like I hate when every other sentence is describing a character, or in this case, Peter Parker, as the boy. Like: *""the boy thinks to himself that it's strange. Walking to the entrance, the boy opens the door slowly.""* It's really off putting.

But I also don't want to keep referencing Peter by name. What are some creative descriptors to use?"

I knew all that going in and chose it specifically, while also having wanted to write that particular scene for a long time.

It's interesting to me that the 100 actually affected me. I'm not super stuck on stats when it comes to my writing, but that is a nice mark.

If I combine all the stories in my ongoing series (up to story #49 now - the next will be another milestone), I have 1416 kudos to 25,813 hits. I'm not being ignored by any means. But those are spread out - 40 on one story, 12 on another, and so on. I don't usually look at my overall stats very much, just the individual stories. I know certain pairings or themes will pull in more readers or be skipped by others. That doesn't bother me or affect what I choose to write 99% of the time.

That 100 looks good, I can't lie."

For readers, what do you use to search fics (the text search, or only by tags?), what do you prefer to use to bookmark fics or anything like this? For writers, what system do you prefer to upload fics (the document manager system on FFnet, or just the HTML text area on AO3)? Any other features you think are really important for you?

I’m just worried I guess and want to rant. (You’re allowed to have your own preferences I don’t want this to guilt trip anyone. If you hate FFN then fine. I just wanted to rant.)"
292,t3_gdeod4,FanFiction,Here is to my two faithful - and only - readers!,"Here is to the only two people who faithfully follow my ridiculous attempt to write a noir detective novel starring John Mulaney and Nick Kroll.

Literally no one else cares. Because seriously, wtf.

But two people do. And they comment on every single chapter. Often the same day I post it. And this prods me on to keep writing and not to abandon it, as I would've surely done without their support.

Let us therefore celebrate the readers who support us in our pointless hyperfixations and obsessions!"
293,t3_ge3eni,FanFiction,Supernatural Fanfiction,"Hi, I've been looking for a certain Supernatural tv show fanfic for awhile now. I can't recall its name or who wrote it, but this was the gist of what it was about:

Dean is in some sort of accident and I think loses his memory. Meg Masters is in it. She makes herself look like Sam and convinces Dean that she's his brother he doesn't remember and they end up going on a killing spree.  In the end after killing sometimes innocent creatures/people Sam and I think Bobby finally find them and they kill Meg. 

It's driving me crazy that I can remember all that, but not the actual name or writer of the story. Does this ring any bells for anyone?"
294,t3_ge4vvh,FanFiction,Problem w/ writing fanfic,"Very hard. Very f-ing hard. I’d be all good with my drafts until 10 min (or maybe longer) I’d be like-

Me: Oooh, this could be better

And changing the whole story entirely 😭😭

Or

When my thoughts goes to a... y’know different direction.

Me: NOOOO! This is supposed to be a fucking BROMANCE!!😭😭 FRIENDSHIP!! Not Yaoi! 😩 😫 😫  (I should stop looking at Pinterest, I mean like bruh, their fanarts is changing my mind about the anime character!)

Then there’s the matter of trying to make your character not OP

Me: Reign it in girl. Just rei- shit! 

Yeah, I fail on that.

There’s also grammar and stuff. Like, I always stop my writing when it comes to dialogues. It frustrates me and it makes me want to throw my phone to the wall.

This is probably a venting flair right?

What are problems you guys have when writing fanfic?"
295,t3_gdqc27,FanFiction,A numbers game,"I've been reading fanfics probably since 2011-12?. I've grown to be very picky and usually sort by favourites/kudos and can drop stuff in a paragraph if I see one too many glaring mistakes or anything my pretentious ass would find cringey. I leave likes late on and comment only if I find something truly exceptional (always novel-length praise but on maybe 5 works in total).

Now I'm on the other side ever since I decided to try writing one around a month ago.  I'm very obsessive with new hobbies (+quarantine free time) so it's already multi chapter and around 50k.  I decided to post on AO3, since it seems more aligned with the story i want to tell. 

The fandom I felt most comfortable starting with is large but also veery branched. Out of the tens of thousands works, the ship I'm writing about has some of the most popular ones but they're maybe around 7% of the total. I'm not doing anything too niche/kinky but it's still quite far from the fandom clichés.

Now bear in mind that I'm /arguably/ a grown ass legal adult who's never been addicted to social media of any form. 

Well lo and behold how the mighty have fallen. My  math background and superiority complex have led me to obsessively refresh the stats page, tracking kudos/hits ratios and comparing my fic to everything, trying to account for all possible factors and see if my work is up to measure. 

I've already received some amazing comments and I hate myself for valuing their numerical value more than the kind words of support. 

I drew the line when after the upload of the latest chapter, my kudos/hits ratio fell drastically below the 10% I liked it at, which caused me to spiral and barely stop myself from creating a goddamn excel spreadsheet and comparing with the whole ass fandom.

I'm putting myself in timeout. I don't want to stop writing, but I do need to take a break from the numbers game and go back to the real reason I started this - contributing something of value to a fictional universe I adore. 

This experience has revealed a very unexpected side of fanfic writing. A huge thank you to every creator out there. You're giving us so much more than any stat can measure."
296,t3_gdv0xz,FanFiction,What are some of the best Percy Jackson fanfictions out there right now?,"I read PJO fanfics as my first every fanfiction then went onto HP. I was wondering what the best PJO fanfics out there rn are? Preferably no Percabeth.

* AO3 only please

* No script fic and OC-centric stuff

* Currently in the mood to read animanga stuff, but I can read fandom blind. Both gen and ships are ok. Crossovers and less popular characters are more than welcome.

298,t3_ge06pj,FanFiction,Having a cast list,"I wrote a story 2+ years ago, and it’s slowly coming out of hiatus. I made a cast list for said story which included a lot of my favorite male actors/people who really reminded me of my characters. 

Recently, I’ve been getting a lot, and I mean A LOT of complaints about one of my character’s face claim. I really don’t want to change it, but I just got another comment, and it was pretty rude. “Who even is this guy compared to (guy everyone else wants as my character)?”

I don’t know what to do. I feel like this stupid issue is making me lose readers. Does anyone know what I could say to them to make it stop?

Any advice is welcomed, thank you!"
299,t3_ge3bzk,FanFiction,My OC Frozen villain,"Title says it:

Aron Arlic is exiled prince of Arendelle and brother of king Agnarr of Arendelle, queen Arianna of Corona, Willow  and three OCs. He is the uncle of Elsa, Anna and Rapunzel and to some OCs. He was always a black sheep in Arendelle. No one loved him and everyone considered him half-insane. When he was little, he killed a dog and he tortured another dog that survived. People were always afraid of him and no one, except his mother, loved him at all. He was a complete psychopath since childhood, but he was also manipulator and very intelligent. 10 years before the story, he killed his youngest sibling, and Elsa and Anna's favorite uncle, Avnir in a tavern fight. After that crime, Elsa and Anna's father exiled him from Arendelle, but then he was exiled from the entire continent and he sailed west to the sea, spending 10 years in exile. 


He returns after those 10 years, nobody knowing what he did in that time. He returned after a certain holiday that is celebrated by all nobles and kingdoms of the continent. The holiday was celebrated in Arendelle and he appeared there with a group of followers and he proclaimed himself a king of not just Arendelle, but of all continent and asked of them to bow to him (which they refuse, of course). 


Aron is a character similar to Euron Greyjoy. He was always into black magic and ancient mysteries and monsters, and he was always into torturing other people, and, though he enjoys torturing people, he never does it without a reason. Everyone thinks that he is demon-possesed and even Southern Isles side with Arendelle to fight him. He is a combination of Scar and Euron, and if Frozen and Frozen II didn't had a villain or enough important villain, Aron would be the great fill-up for the absence of villains in those two (I believe you know what I mean by ""fill-up"", forgive me, English is not my native), and he would be the most dangerous person Anna and Elsa would ever meet. This story would ignore Frozen II.


I would like to know your opinion on Aron as you read about him here, and give some advice if you can.

Thanks in advance!:)"
300,t3_ge7eyx,FanFiction,Does followers and fevorit reflects how good the fanfic is?,When i go to fanfiction site i I usually read the one with most followers or fevorits. I mean in my mind if the  story is good and it been out there for couple years  then it should have been more popular. If it is not then there most be something wrong with it and to be honest most of the time i happen to be correct in my assumption
301,t3_gdyc3j,FanFiction,Copying or Coincidence?,"It's probably nothing, but I feel like this author is taking more than inspiration from my work for their stories. I'm not saying that I'm the best in the fandom, or the most popular, anything like that. My first story was not reviewed by this person, (not that I expect her to) and, a few months later, she posted her own which was very similar to mine.

Both had:

The main character going through a painful, public ordeal,

The community rallying around the family,

A visit from the MC's favourite celebrities,

A lengthy, hospital stay,

An online fund to help with medical bills,

Journalists interested in the story,

MC improves, and then gets pneumonia, worsening their condition,

The nurse that cares for the MC has a similar name: Judith/Julie,

The family making a schedule so they can both work and be with the MC in hospital.

That may not sound like a lot, but I just found it weird. The main difference is that her character dies, while mine lives. (Author mentioned it in summary.) On the final chapter of my story, I mentioned (perhaps stupidly) in the author's note, that I was writing at alternate version where MC dies, and then I got a review from her, asking me how I was planning to upload it; if it was going to be from the beginning, or start at the point where she dies. Again, I found that a bit weird. I said that it would begin at the point where she died, but got no reply.

I haven't uploaded that story yet, as it's not complete, but I wrote another one, with the same MC; an origin story. Just over a week later, this author uploads a similar story; about the MC, and the origins. Both titles even have the word “origin” in it. In her author's note for her first chapter, she said, that it was going to be “very different from (my pen-name), despite a similar opening.” My story is 4 chapters in, and hers is still on the first, and I uploaded chapter 4 yesterday, and I got my first review from her, simply asking “how many more chapters?”

Am I being paranoid, or is this weird? Or is it something that you just have to accept in the world of fan fiction?"

I'm  trying to read some half-way decent fanfic but I keep getting ads in the middle of the of the fanfic, like right as I'm on the actual page with the chapter posted there is 2-4 ads littered in between the walls of text. This is all on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net) .

&amp;#x200B;

What's up with this? Is this normal now? Or is there something wrong on my end? I hope to god I didnt get some shitty adware virus or something. Btw I hope I chose an appropriate flair for this kind of topic"
304,t3_gdzl5s,FanFiction,Posting a story in two languages.,"Hi. I've been writing fanfiction for years now, but started writing my stories on english just recently, and after a lot of studying.

I want to get to a larger public in the fandom I write for. I could make the translations myself, because it really doesn't present a problem and I'm able to do it.

But I want to know if it's really worth it. I'm not even sure if I should post both versions of the work in the same account, or even the same platform. Maybe there's other apps for fanfiction in which this second language is more popular.

It's spanish, by the way.

I considered Wattpad at first because there's a lot of Hispanic people that use it. And perhaps this is a mistaken view I have on that platform, but I see grammar/orthography errors more often and in almost every paragraph. It's okay to see those a few times I guess, but when it's too repetitive, I just leave. Maybe Wattpad is often used by younger people. I don't know.

I want to see what you think about this idea. And if you know of other fanfiction platforms I could check out :)
Thanks in advance."
305,t3_gdn7q1,FanFiction,I updated my longfic today!,"So a couple weeks ago I was all up in the “my writing sucks and this is pointless because nobody is reading it” feels and put my longfic on hiatus. It took a lot for me to not just outright delete it, but a comment from a reader saying they look forward to every chapter saved it from the depths of the computer recycle bin. 

Anyway, for the past couple of weeks I’ve just ignored it, mostly out of frustration because I have pantsed it so far and I had no idea where it was going and how I was going to pull all the threads together. I woke up this morning with a ton of ideas and wrote out an outline for the rest of the story and it inspired a new chapter. I’m feeling accomplished and more confident in my story. If nothing else, I want to finish the fic because I want to read it, even if I’m the only one."
306,t3_gdhsx2,FanFiction,"Baristas of r/fanfiction, what is your opinion of coffeeshop AUs?","Do you read them? What do writers tend to get wrong? What do they get right?

309,t3_gdo5aj,FanFiction,I want to write fanfic - and my brain says no,"To anybody who decides to read this - first of all, thanks. I want to say in advance that if any of this sounds rude, I promise it's not my intention. In fact, I'm writing this post because I really want to do a fanfic! It's from a fandom that I'm sure has sooooo much stuff already - and idk if you can call this idea in my head fanfic since it's basically a rewrite with a customized character and more details and dialogue than the original.

Okay. Anyways.

I've loved writing since I was a kid, especially fantasy. And mermaids. God, so many mermaids. But from that young age I've always felt... *off* about fan fiction. Maybe I was trained to think that fan fiction writing is theft, in some kind of odd way, taking characters that aren't mine and doing what I want with them. I've also read from a handful of authors who aren't fans of fan fiction themselves. One such prominent thing I remember in junior high is when I was reading a blog post by Rick Riordan, and he was asked about how he feels about Percy Jackson fan fics. He basically said something along the lines of how it feels like people are going into his closet and trying on his clothes. Unfortunately, this kind of stuck with me - which is a damn shame, because there are some great characters I'd likely try writing with if I didn't feel this way for so long. Not long after reading that I had somebody tell me that ""Well, he shouldn't have put his laundry on the street then."" But at the time I really really admired him (frankly, I still do) and it's stuck anyways.

Now I've got this idea, this thing I want to put into motion. So badly. I wrote one sentence before coming here because what I really need is some words of advice to banish the ""character theft"" goblin from my brain. I need you to kick me in the butt and convince my stupid brain that fan fic is as awesome as I think it can be.

I realize this sounds stupid, but... I really appreciate any nice things you gotta say. And if this sounds like me bashing what you guys do, I promise that's not the intention. In fact, I'd say more than half of my writerly friends have extensive fan fic projects of their own. I just want to put mine into action before I EXPLODE OF THE ANXIETY OF THIS BUILDING CHARACTER STORY IN MY HEAD.

So... anybody who's found a way out of this boat? Anything you guys wish you could say to somebody who has told you fan fic is stupid? Because I want to hear it and get started on this story."
310,t3_gdudod,FanFiction,23 and just writing my first fic - is it too late?,"I've been feeling like i'm in a huge rut these past few days - I've been in fandoms for 10 years now, and even though I've always really wanted to contribute, I've never really buckled down on honing a skill! 

Anyways, since writing was always my strong suit, and I'm ever grateful to fanfiction for keeping me sane (especially now), I really wanted to give it a shot! 

The thing is, I feel like so many amazing authors started when they were in middle school or high school, and I just really regret not starting earlier, and I'm worried it's a little too late for me. I know that's not really true, but I can't help fixating on all the time I've wasted and how much better I could have gotten if I started earlier (one of my favourite fic writers is my age, so I just can't help but compare myself). 

I'm honestly not 100% sure why I'm writing this - I guess I'm just wondering if there's anybody else who started ""later""? Or who found that the learning curve isn't as steep as it would be for a young writer?

Thanks to everybody who read this!"

I have a WIP that I’m working on chapter 16 for right now (over 75,000 words whoop whoop) and my OC who started off very empathetic and compassionate in the beginning is gonna do something that would have been against her morals before. But at this point in the story, she’s gotten involved romantically with a criminal who has kinda shown her his world if you will and she makes a quick decision that results in someone’s death. Not an important character or anything, just someone.

I’m struggling with how she would justify this action to herself. I don’t want her to lose her kind nature but the story flows better if she kinda brushes it off or even enjoys it, honestly. It’s a bit more complicated than that (she’s built up to this point slowly) but that’s the gist. I’m thinking that she just feels empathy for the rag tag bunch of criminals she’s grown to love and everyone else can get lost but I’m not sure."

Four days ago I wrote my first vignette-style story (I had too google what a vignette was, and was intrigued enough to attempt it): a 2000-word romance/tragedy.

Both of those made my readers cry, one comment have even said “I knew my heart was going to hurt, but I didn’t expect you to rip it out, stomp on it, and THEN shatter it.”

This made my heart swell, and I haven’t felt so alive and validated in years. There weren’t many reviews on these two fics since I’m still a new writer and don’t have much of a reader base. But damn, I am so grateful for the ones I do have, and so extremely happy for those touching reviews.

Second question. I myself am writing a fic, which follows the game it's based on, but with more characters, unexpected turns of events, and a ""post-ending"", which takes half the story. The problem here; since it follows the game's canon( at least for a while) and i'm going to publish it to Ao3, i want to include a canon related tag, but don't know what to use.

Also, sorry if this is a little confusing and/or misleading, i'm bad at explaining things and English isn't my first language. But hope you understood at least something. Looking forward to the replies!"

I think they are found by the fellowship somewhere between Rivendell &amp; Moria, the fellowship takes them with them to Lothlorian where only 2 of them can be sent home, so the OC sends back the 2 youngest kids.

322,t3_gdns4y,FanFiction,"Can someone explain this concept of ""gamer"" fics?","So gamer fics where the character unlocks the ability to live their life as an RPG character more or less. Levels, skills, inventory, quests, parties, etc.

These aren't the concepts that confuse me. I'm a gamer so I understand most of the jargon in these fics but it's the concept of ""stockpiling attribute and skill points"" that I don't really understand.

&amp;#x200B;

The story devolves from 'this character gained gamer powers' to 'this character is going to overthink EVERYTHING that comes with that power' leading to a lot of things like 'maybe i'll need those points later on, sure they'd be incredibly useful to use now and make my life so much easier but what if I really want a skill several levels from now. I best save most of the points I get!' 

When I see stuff like ""Unused attribute points: 45!"" I get kind of annoyed. Maybe it's because of how I play games but how are you going to have so many unused attribute points while you're on a mission to get stronger! 

And i'd chalk it up to something with the author but it seems to be most of the gamer fics I read. 

Is it something to do with how the 'webtoon' did things? I never watched it so maybe it's just something authors decided to keep from the original source?

Can someone please explain this to me? What am I missing? Why does this happen?"

330,t3_gdtp17,FanFiction,"If you've been given 3 wishes by God (no limitations) and given the chance to reincarnate to a fictional world, what would those be?","I'm currently reading many fanfictions about MC died and God/OP beings giving them wishes that the MC can survive, for the God's entertainment, but not to OP wishes and send them to an fictional world like anime or Marvel or DC universe.

I'm curious what others may think if they were in that situation but no limitations. 

I mean, you can wish to become a God or travel the multiverse. Let imagination go wild. 

You have to use your 3 wishes before you reincarnate"
331,t3_gdds6z,FanFiction,Finished my longest fic yet!!,"Hi guys,

Just posted the final chapters of my longest fic to date! 30,591 words!! Previously my fics all clocked in at under 15k. I'm really proud of myself! 

Pretty sure 10k of the words were smut but everything I write is just elaborate justification for why two boys should bang, so who cares!

Now to maybe try and finish one of the 6 ongoing original projects that I have... (But maybe just one more smutty one-shot first...)"
332,t3_gdfict,FanFiction,"I'm ready to end my hiatus today... Real Life: ""Yeah, that's not happening.""","My XCOM fanfic has been on hiatus for the past two weeks because I got blindsided by the surprise release of a new game that added a lot of new cannon material to the XCOM universe.

Over the weekend I finally got my ducks in a row and I had decided on how my fic was going to handle the new story details of Chimera Squad. I even had a plan to give some of the characters from the new game quick cameos in my fic. It was going to be fun! So I committed myself to ending breaktime and posting a new chapter today...

**But then a construction worker accidentally cut the fiber-optic cable... and now the entire neighborhood has lost internet access for the foreseeable future.**

All I've got is my smartphone now, and posting a 5800 word chapter online with this little screen and keypad is starting to seem like a really uphill battle.

So, to the guy who cut the fiber optic cable this morning... have some angry forbidden words... it's on the house!"
333,t3_gd4moo,FanFiction,what do you MEAN i have to write the middle part,"i don't write in order, i also don't particularly plan (which definitely always works out and is definitely how every writer should definitely work because it's got such a great and wonderful success rate lol.) my plan is—it ends up at point b. at one point.

i write scenes that come vividly in my head, and i write them once i can't get them out of my head anymore. like, i can and have written 10k words in the span of a day, pretty much nonstop. but everything i didn't immediately get in my head? the stuff that connects the first scene to the second to third and etc? that's a no-go.

like, i know what i WANT to (probably) happen/accomplish in the in-betweens. but i haven't imagined the scene so i can't really seem to get it out. i think my brain just gives up like nope you've wrote now we're done for the next few months when you're inevitably gonna pick up a new fandom, abandon this fic and start the whole process over again.

i've gotten better since the last fic i posted, i just can't show anyone because nothing is finished lmao"
334,t3_gdqjl8,FanFiction,Advice for My Protagonist’s Journey?,"For the story I’m coming up with, I want to write a standard zero to hero story, or at least start it off as one. This guy named Ryan is thrown into the end of the world and has to help prevent it from happening in the first place. At first, he does a pretty good job. Sure he stumbles a bit, but he gets his bearings, treats his team well and learns just how things work. Things are looking pretty good.

Then the Big Bad comes in and curb stomps him and his team. Now that the reality of the situation has set in, he starts to get more serious. And things start to get harder. Now it becomes even harder to save people, save his teammates and keep his sanity, all while putting up a happy face.

Now, I want to write it so that his love interest gets killed. He’ll snap; not into a berserk rage, but more of a “F##k it, I’m done playing nice. If a couple lives are lost trying to save the entire f**king world, then so be it.” He’ll still feel guilty about it, his friends would protest, but he still keeps going. Once the weight of his actions kick in, he has a mental breakdown. He gets better and starts being more of a hero again, but the scars would still be there.

What I’m asking is how do I make this feel fluid and believable to an audience? I don’t want to present him as some edgy character pointlessly lashing out at the world. I wanna add a bit more nuance to it."
335,t3_gdl52s,FanFiction,Ads in the middle of the page on Fanfiction.net?,"I have not used Fanfiction.net in quite a while. Been using other sites. But I hav recently decided to go back and reread an old story I liked and in the middle of reading it, an ad comes up. Is this normal? Is it a new addition? It’s incredibly annoying. Totally disturbed the flow of the story. Really getting into the story and then all of a sudden there is a big ad?

337,t3_gdc28i,FanFiction,I orphaned my old fics. I had been working on one of them for 3 years before I abandoned it.,"It was painful as hell. I hadn't updated them in over three years. 

I did it because people kept commenting on them. They were either hopeful ""I HOPE you update this"" types, or angry ""How dare you abandon this!?"" rants. 

It made me depressed, so I orphaned them. I usually delete my  fics, but these ones got pretty popular (it was obvious people loved them), so I decided to keep them up.

edit: just to be clear, I started writing fic in 2013. I worked on one of them from 2014-2017."

339,t3_gdmtms,FanFiction,how do you feel about feminization in m/m fics?,"I’m speaking specifically about fics where male characters (non-trans) have female genitalia (whether in an a/b/o or hybrid fic or not). I’ve seen arguments for both sides as either it’s wrong and offensive/triggering to the trans community or that it’s just a kink and is fine as long as it’s tagged properly. I’m cis myself so I’m hoping to gain more insight into others opinions on this topic, particularly if those who are trans."

341,t3_gdr6pk,FanFiction,Reading Rollcall - May 05,"Welcome to Reading Rollcall!

This thread is a place for in-depth discussion for any fanfiction you're currently reading or have read.

* State the `Fandom | Rating | Any Applicable Content Warnings | Link to fic` **at the top of your comment!**

* A short summary or some hype for the fic will give people some context for your discussion.

* Play fair.  Comments and discussion needn't be positive, but they must be civil.  Authors can find where their fics are linked with relative ease, so assume they're going to read what you've written.

* Discuss the tropes, the characters, the setting, the plot, the themes.  You get the idea.

* Give your interpretations and headcanons room to run.  Theories and guesses are completely valid forms of discussion.

* If you see someone talking about a fic that looks interesting, ask them questions.  If you've read a fic and recognize it, have a chat with your fellow users!

* There's no reason this post can't also function as an interactive rec thread.  Just don't go tossing up a bunch of links without pausing to talk about *why* people should read it and *why* you enjoyed it."
342,t3_gdgi32,FanFiction,My muse has left the building,"I was just curious if anyone else ever felt like their brain had been wrung out like a old wet sponge after a burst of inspired writing. I just wrote 4,000+ words in one straight solid burst. My brain was in top form, the words just pouring flawlessly from my mind as I typed. It was amazing...

And now, well I was planning to, and wanted to, start on the next chapter, my brain feels like there isn't a drop of creativity left in it. It's all numb and blank as I stare at the empty page under the Chapter 14 header. I guess my brain has nothing left to give today and just wants a nap now.

Is so frustrating that it went from a flowing fountain of words, straight into an old dry well  that I can't pump a single sentence out of."
343,t3_gdm5ep,FanFiction,Offending Orignal Creators,"Anyone else struggle with the fear of offending the original creator? 

Like, I love when the creators of series or shows interact with their online fans with genuine love, support, and gratitude. On Twitter I’ll see a a few creators retweet, favorite, or even reply to fan art or some other fan made work. But, for my situation, I enjoy ...uh... more explicit content. I’m always afraid that someone is gonna recommenced my fics or share some of my art and it’ll get around to the original creator and he’ll just be mortified by what I’ve done to his characters. 

Is this a valid concern or am I just overthinking it? Has this ever happened to you or does this kind of fear keep you from posting on certain sites/posting at all?"
344,t3_gdf16t,FanFiction,Did I take it too far?,"So I've noticed that the more I write the more common it's becoming for people to TELL me I need to update x thing or write about y pairing. I ended up putting this at the end of my latest chapter.

""So recently I have had a few people telling me through reviews or PMs to update X thing next or write a story about y thing. Not even suggesting, telling. I'll say this right now, writing is a hobby that I would like to become a job but right now all it is is a hobby. I don't owe you a specific update schedule, I also don't owe you a story about a specific pairing I don't care about. I update when I feel like I can write the chapter well and have the energy. I write what I feel like when I feel like it. If my stories are really that important to your life that you NEED me to update there are links on my profile you could click and compensate me for an amount equivalent to a bag of chips per month.

For everyone else, thank you for reading.""

It felt great to say that but I did immediately lose 5 or so followers, although that could have been since the chapter was a bit out there. I'm not great at understanding how others are feeling so I'm not sure if that went too far or not."
345,t3_ge1mep,FanFiction,Pee fics please(SFW only),"I’ve got writers block at the moment so I need someone else’s omo. Anything under rated M is fine. Also, English fandoms only, anime isn’t really my jam..particular interest in Marvel, Star Wars and Harry Potter. Thx🥰"
346,t3_gdhnhm,FanFiction,What Does a Self Insert Follow That a Normal OC Doesn't?,"I got a pretty negative and nitpicky comment on my fic the other day. Nothing out of the norm. I almost looked over it, but then something caught my eye.

They said, ""YOUR OC IS SO BLANTANLY A SELF INSERT THAT IT'S ALMOST FUNNY."" (The entire comment was in caps.)  This doesn't bother me much because he's not and I've had many readers tell me he's a fleshed out OC, but it still caught my eye. I've never been good on picking up when a character is a self insert or just a normal OC, but so many people seem to know that I thought I'd ask. 

What's the tell tale signs of a self insert compared to an OC? Can you even tell or was this reader just talking out of their ass?"
347,t3_gdsan9,FanFiction,Anxiety over writing about different cultures,"Alrighty, I'm pretty sure I already know I'm going to be told it's okay to write fics with cultures different from my own, how could it not be, however even knowing that, I still get anxiety about it. I know I'm definitely making it out to be a bigger deal than it is.

I want to write for Scissor Seven / Killer Seven, which is a Chinese animation. I highly suggest watching it, but that's not the point. It has a lot of focus on Qi and martial arts and there are some cultural aspects that of course don't line up with my own American life. I want to make sure I properly represent the culture in my writing, but at the same time, there's no possible way for me to write with 100% accuracy without years of research and real world experience with the culture.

I really, really care about accuracy in my own writing and I would hate to accidentally misrepresent a culture. What should I do about it? Should I address it at all? I just know the fic will end up being pretty Americanized no matter what I do, so should I make note of that or would that be weird?"
348,t3_gds9z5,FanFiction,A Character Conundrum,"I've been plotting out some aspects of my WIP for a while now, more specifically for the main character of said WIP.

A good chunk of what I've planned for the story, say the first third/half, has taken place outside of canon utilizing minor characters and OCs for the plot which has given me a lot of creative control so far. 

But the part I've started to outline has the MC sharing the same setting with the central main characters and I plan to have them interacting quite often. Sounds easy enough. They're all likeable characters and some of my favorites, it should be easy to think up interactions and dialogue. 

The problem is that the MC is a sarcastic asshole who's character development hasn't quite kicked in yet, making his personality a stark contrast from the relatively nice, friendly, and optimistic main canon cast. 

It would be extremely out of character for either the MC or the canon characters to be buddy buddy save for one or two. But it would be sacrelidge to have him be extremely negative or apathetic to said characters, or even worse, make my fic look like a god-awful bashing fic.

I need to find a balance between the two, but I'm coming up short. Any advice would be welcome."
349,t3_gdh959,FanFiction,Question about internal dialogue,"So im a new writer and I can't seem to find the answer to this question online.

How should I arrange this next dialogue? The first part is an internal monologue so it should be in italics, but I also want to describe the actions that the girl is doing. 

So should just leave it as italics or add quotation marks, even if it's in her mind?

""Another one huh? I wonder how many times I've seen it by now."" the girl thought while wiping away the barely existing tears in her eyes.

𝘈𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘩𝘶𝘩? 𝘐 𝘸𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦𝘴 𝘐'𝘷𝘦 𝘴𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘪𝘵 𝘣𝘺 𝘯𝘰𝘸. The girl thought while wiping away the barely existing tears in her eyes."
350,t3_gddpf3,FanFiction,"Should I ""fake"" British English for a British setting?","American English is what I'm most familiar with. Thanks to the influence of British youtubers, I do sometimes slip up and use the occasional ""innit"", ""lad"", maybe even a cheeky ""shag"" or the inescapable ""nonce"" in my everyday language. But most British slang doesn't come natural to me and it's not part of my active vocabulary, only my passive vocabulary - if at all.

When I read fanfiction about British characters and the author incorporates British slang or even just spelling into their story, I get kind of jealous. It does wonders for immersion and authenticity in my opinion. I feel like some of the charm would get lost if I tried to write a similar fic but in American English.

It also makes me wonder if the authors of those stories actually are British or if they're just really good at emulating accents? Is this something that people do and that I should try? I'm worried about it coming across as too forced. I'm just imagining myself looking at a sentence with a thesaurus open, trying to find a way to forcibly make my sentence sound more British..."
351,t3_gde62s,FanFiction,Another chapter is out now.,"Fuh... Chapter 16 of my fic is out now. Suffice to say, I almost done with the fic. Not that I will abandon it. I mean that I have a few more chapters to go until completion. Also I may have some plan to continue my series, not in a Pokémon universe, but somewhere else. 

Anyway, you can now enjoy the new chapter."
352,t3_gdidxz,FanFiction,Not sure what to do...,"So I have a beta who over the last few years that I’ve been writing, I’ve become good friends with, but recently (after years of helping me) they have complained about my writing and how much effort they have to put into it. It’s all felt a bit harsh.

I also have 3 or so pre-readers,but none of them ever mention that it’s that horrible to read. It’s starting to really get to me, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t really want to lose my friendship, and I’ve always appreciated any work that they’ve put in, but I’m feeling stuck, and I’m really not enjoying writing as much now. I feel like I’m handing in an essay at school every time I send a chapter to her. 

I’ve run my work through grammar programs, but still it seems to not be enough. I’m so close to giving up."
353,t3_gcxpo6,FanFiction,I commissioned an artist to draw out a scene for my fanfic (as a birthday present to myself) and I just received it today! It's so amazing I am going to cry,"Being in the quarantine dragged me back into writing fanfics, and honestly, I've missed it so much. It's my 10th year on FFN so I decided to commission a piece from an artist that I really like!

This piece turned out SO GORGEOUS and honestly, I can't do anything but gape at it at this moment. It made me so, so happy (this past 1.5 months had been really hard on me) and I just wanted to share &lt;3"
354,t3_gdqfid,FanFiction,Help be think of a better name,"Hey-o! So I have a Spirited Away fanfic on Wattpad, and it needs a new title (because it’s just called “spirited away fanfic” right now). Can someone please help me think of a better title? I’m having trouble coming up with one."
355,t3_gdfbnj,FanFiction,Feeling like a jerk,"I recently deleted a some of my stories that I had written a couple years ago. Reason being, I have grown so much as a writer and my earlier works are cringeworthy, to say the least. I have received a couple PM’s from people requesting I republish those stories, but I really don’t want to. Should I just repost them? Or, how should I respond to these messages, if at all?"
356,t3_gdcp6t,FanFiction,Horror,"I am thinking about writing a horror fanfiction, but one of my main problems is that whenever I write scary, high-tension scenes,  they are never actually creepy like I intend it too. Can I get any tips?"
357,t3_gd2hwz,FanFiction,Kids coming across your messed up fics,"Ok, so I recently got a comment on a really dark and messed up fic I wrote some years ago. It was the equivalent of this: ""I read this fic as a kid and now as an adult it makes me even sadder."" and it sort of messed *me* up, because I reaaally don't want to know about it if minors read my screwed up dark and/or explicit fics. Goddamit. I plastered it with warnings. Makes me consider making my fics members only. 

Anything like this happened to you?"
358,t3_gdmdjt,FanFiction,Star Wars/Star Trek/Doctor Who Crossover,"I would like to write a crossover between the three biggest science fiction franchises of the here and now. My idea is that, due to a malfunction with the Tardis, the galaxies of Star Wars and Star Trek are interconnected by a multitude of portals. Now it's up to the Jedi, Starfleet, and the Doctor to stop the various evils of their respective universes from overrunning everything. Takes place during the prequel trilogy, the 'Next Gen' era, and the Eleventh Doctor era respectively. I am setting a fixed portion of chapters at 50 or less.

I have come again to the FanFiction corner of Reddit to ask for some advice on how to do this crossover justice."
359,t3_gdk1jt,FanFiction,How do you write systems in FanFiction without losing the interest of the reader?,"So, one of my guilty pleasures is reading Gamer Fics. I especially enjoyed ""The Games We Play"", and I am hoping to write a story my self. Do any of you have any experience writing systems? If so, how important are they to your story?"

361,t3_gd3bjw,FanFiction,I am weary of people writing weary when they mean wary.,"This is, hands down, the most common 'similar words' mistake I see in fanfiction.  I see this even more than the your/you're and they're/there/their things.  Why?  I know there's only one letter difference, and spellcheck wouldn't catch it since weary is an actual word, but I can recall exactly one instance when I have seen the word 'wary' used in a fanfic.  I see it replaced with weary so often that I'm pretty much convinced that the majority of people really do think that 'wary' is actual spelled 'weary'."

364,t3_gdghn2,FanFiction,I may have gone overboard...,"I tried setting up Google Analytics using [this guide](https://fanslashfic.com/2018/04/23/how-to-track-ao3-fanfiction-statistics-using-google-analytics/), with no luck. Still desperate to get some of that juicy data, I combed through all my emails and recorded the Kudos count for each day, and looked at the date each bookmark was added and compiled it into this glorious monument to obsessive statistics-tracking tendencies:

[Behold! A spreadsheet!](https://i.imgur.com/SeOoTzW.png)

I wish I had started this earlier, since the only way to track views is to record it at a specific point in time, so I can't really go back and see how that has improved. I was curious if Sundays are still the most active days in this current pandemic, or if its more of a free-for-all.

Anyone else this obsessed with their statistics? Or has anyone got the Google Analytics to work? It would have been really cool to see how long someone spent reading my fic."
365,t3_gdmmyi,FanFiction,I’m looking for a long ASOIAF fanfic similar to Purple Days with more of a focus on preparing a kingdom to defeat the Night King’s army. A character with modern knowledge and knowledge of the white walkers needed.,"I‘m looking for read a long  (200k+ word count) Star Wars/ASOIAF crossover SI fanfiction. I suppose it doesn’t necessarily need to be Star Wars, as long as the main character has the ability to impart high tech knowledge to the masses. 

I really want a morally grey (or evil as long as it isn’t too edgy) main character that has to fight the Night King’s army (Purple Days take over the world version) with whatever tech he can make while politicking and trying not to die. 

Does this exist? I’ve tried a few similar fanfics that seemed to go down this path but either diverged or was too poorly written. I haven’t actually watched/read Star Wars since I was a kid so that fandom isn’t at all necessary.

Anyway, any recs are better than no recs even if it’s not exactly what I’m looking for! Male Mc’s preferred."

367,t3_gdlwvl,FanFiction,question on endings,"Okay so I’m planning out an endgame for one of my gorillaz fics ( you don’t have to know gorillaz to answer I’m just setting up backstory) where the premise of the story revolves around 2D’s drug addictions and the ending of my story is gonna fall at the plastic beach era. Anyways with an angsty story such as this one would you prefer a heartbreaking dramatic ending or a happy one where most but not all the pieces fall into place? 

Because with this one for my angst ending it would mean a double character death but with the good ending it would mean the character he thought was dead wasn’t actually. Anyways let me know this is all in the works"

374,t3_gcp4e7,FanFiction,The Stigma around Fanfiction,"I’ve been seeing a lot of people talk about how they love to write fanfiction but are embarrassed by the idea of being a fanfic writer or that they are discouraged due to peoples reactions and opinions on fanfiction. I just want people to not be discourage. 

Fan fiction is honestly an amazing outlet for creative people. Fan fiction is every where in different forms. 

There are YouTube channels of people creating &amp; discussing theories of what should have happened in films/tv shows.

Whole threads on Reddit not in the fanfiction community talking about how they would have re-written the ending of a show , a comic , manga or a movie.

Gamers making spin-off fan games that are based off their favourite games.
Singers making covers of their favourite songs. 

The difference is with us is that we write instead of sing , theorise or play. 
Don’t forget fan art too. 

It’s always about how fanfiction isn’t good and that the majority of fanfics are subpar. People seem to forget the masterpieces that have been created due to and via  fanfiction. 

So sure, maybe Not all fan fictions are 10/10, just like how not all of theories are good theories. Not all fan games are good games and not all of the singers can sing , not all of the artists are particularly good at drawing but they do it anyway because they love to do it. 

Don’t let the stigma of being a fanfic writer stop you from doing what you love, expressing yourself and growing as a writer if that’s your goal."

377,t3_gd4xev,FanFiction,Why do people post a review saying I did something wrong when I didn’t?,"Ok, so I have a Vampyr fic and one of the scenes has Jonathan kill a group of criminals by sucking their blood. Typical vampire, or should I say Ekon, stuff, right? Well someone disagrees. He left a review saying it didn’t make sense that Jonathan didn’t just drink a little from people and not kill them, but he doesn’t seem to understand that

A. That makes even less sense since I’m using the Evil Jonathan and not the good one for my fic, and B. Blood is like a drug to the vampires in the world of Vampyr. Once they start feeding on someone, they can’t stop until they’re dead.

It just frustrates me that I go through all this trouble of actually searching for all the lore collectibles in a game so I can be accurate, and yet people still say this kind of stuff. I bet he never even played Vampyr."
378,t3_gd7pxd,FanFiction,The annoying reviews that screw up the whole review page,"Exactly what the title says. I laugh but I was kind of annoyed by a recent review that used absolutely no spaces whatsoever. [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net) reads it as one word and stretches out the review box to accommodate, but of course this screws up the visual for the WHOLE page. It wasn't even a nice review either. It was just someone ""screaming"" a character's name because we used the wrong character as the bad guy, even though we had said upfront and many times in author notes that we *can't* follow canon because we had the story planned out very far before the sequels and the game theory explanation came out.  

It's a user-experience issue with the website itself, so I know it isn't all the reader's fault. I appreciate their attention, even if they didn't like that part of the story. The interaction with them afterward was just very strange. I quit responding after I realized the conversation wasn't going to make any sense."
379,t3_gd2h2k,FanFiction,Reply to my comment made my day much better,"Without going into details, I was having one of the worst days I’ve had in a while earlier today. What made it even worse was that I also tried to write and couldn’t do it for longer than 15 minutes (didn’t even really produce anything) so I spent the rest of the day doing absolutely nothing since that basically ruined everything else for me. Among other things, this has been happening a lot lately and is frustrating as hell for me to deal with, hence why I was so upset.

I got an email notification on my phone around 2 PM and was very surprised to see that it was the author whose story I left a pretty detailed comment on replying to me. I left it nearly a month ago to the day and after a week or two, I figured they weren’t going to respond to it. I was a little disappointed at first but I quickly forgot about it so getting an alert for that today was one of the last things I expected. However, I didn’t actually read it until about half an hour ago and WOW, I wish I read it as soon as I got it because it probably would’ve made the rest of my day that much better.

It was probably the most appreciative, heartwarming reply from an author I’ve ever gotten, and I must have left over a hundred comments on stories by now. They tend to be long and detailed with what I liked in specific as well as constructive criticism if I have any and they actually thanked me for doing all of that. They even said it “made” their whole month. I’m glad I was at least able to make one person happy today. :)"

did/does anyone else experience this? i feel like i’m just being way too picky with my works and putting them to overly-high standards. but at the same time, i feel like i just suck at writing overall bwahah

386,t3_gdi0oq,FanFiction,Too long chapters?,"I feel like I have the opposite problem of many people in here,  I think I write way too much. My longfic is almost at 70k now and I havent even started introducing important characters, the ""hero's journey"" of my main characters hasnt even started yet, I havent introduced most of the love interests either and even then I feel like everything I have written is necessary, the events I have writen about are setting up for those things.
I wonder if maybe I do too much internal monologue (my fic is in 1rst person),  but I dont feel like stopping it because it is what I am best at, I suck at descriptions of everything except physical appearance, I suck at action (although I am trying really  hard to fix it), I think my strenght as a writer are emotions and dialogue.
I havent grown bored of my fic, it is incredibly fun to write, in fact I dont care how long it gets, but I know most people wont like reading something this long, I think my readers are starting to get bored already because I havent received comments in a long time, they are probably hoping for the romance and adventure parts already and I am still setting up for it. 
I would still write even with no comments but I would be lying if I said it doesnt discourage me to see my inbox empty, it is just really fun to receive comments, and not receiving anything takes out the fun out of posting the fic, it makes me feel I should just keep it to myself since I get nothing from posting it.
I think my chapters are too long as well (7-8k each the longest ones).
Have any of you ever writen that much without getting into the ""important"" parts yet? Are there people out there who like these types of long fics?"
387,t3_gdti7o,FanFiction,Things I f**king hate seeing in fanfiction,"So these are just a couple things that will quickly make me lose interest in a fic. These are all things I personally *hate* reading.

1. Excessive spelling and grammar errors

This is probably the most common mistake I tend to find, especially on Wattpad. A couple mistakes here and there are fine, but when I get a couple paragraphs in and start questioning if the author can even read, then there's something fundamentally wrong with the story. ""Loose"" is *not* the same as ""lose,"" ""too"" is *not* the same as ""to,"" ""wander"" is *very* different from ""wonder,"" and for the love of all that is holy, ""could of"" is *not a fucking thing*.

2. When characters are *supremely* OOC

If you want a character to be somewhat OOC (out of character), that's fine, but if the character's personality is completely unrecognizable from their canon counterpart, I just can't stand it. Keep in mind, if you're writing an AU fic, I can understand. But if you're writing a general fic set firmly in the canon of My Hero Academia (for example), and Deku is all of a sudden a vulgar, hot-headed pervert and All Might is an abusive jackass, then you have crossed a line.

3. When a fic where most of the characters are underage is classified as a smut fic

Do I even have to explain myself here?

4. When the summary tells me jack-shit about the actual story

If the story's at least well-written, I can accept it. It's just something I don't like. Like, if you want to maintain some mystery, that's okay, but you can still write a basic overview of what's going to happen while still maintaining mystery, because it's a fucking *summary*. We're not asking you to run through every character's backstory, personality, and motivation, but you have to give us *something*. I swear to God, if I see another fic where the summary is a vague quote that doesn't tell me anything, I'm gonna go crazy!

5. When the fic is a crossover, but the crossover is either done poorly or it doesn't make sense.

If you want to write a crossover between your two favorite fandoms, that's fine. Just make sure it makes sense. I can understand and get behind a crossover between Star Wars and Star Trek, or Marvel and DC, but if you write a crossover between Lord of the Rings and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I'm going to have some questions. But if you write a crossover between John Wick and 007 and then try to shove in every single villain and supporting character, neglecting the important characters in the process, from both series, I don't care if the crossover *does* make sense, I'm not going to continue reading it. I'm not an uneducated Philistine, you just suck at writing crossovers.

But yeah, that's pretty much all I had to say. So... yeah."

396,t3_gcvd7f,FanFiction,genderbending: yay or nay?,"i know it's a bit of a controversial ""thing"" to do in fics, and understandably so, especially when it's a guy into a lady. because a lot of the time (particularly when it comes to genderbent retellings of the canonical story) these fics are overly reliant on overdone tropes. for example, everything is ditched in favor of everyone freaking out over the fact that the MC is a completely different sex now, the author constantly reminds you that the MC has been changed, and a lot of the times the story will veer into romance/smut/slash very quickly (even when that type of stuff is not the original story's focal point!). i suspect the ""obligatory"" romance is because the author thinks, ""well, this character's a girl now so she needs a boyfriend!"" and there's a lot to unpack in that sentiment alone, lmao.

the worst is when the character's personality is completely butchered after being genderbent. doing/saying/thinking things they wouldn't canonically simply because they've been changed. it's not even informed, nuanced changes in their identity/personality (because who you are/what you identify as will ALWAYS flavor your perspective in life), it's almost always stereotypes of either sex. and i think that really sucks because there is some excellent exploration potential in genderbending, namely in the ways society and character interactions would change (especially if there are sexist undercurrents in the canonical work).

it's just frustrating that there IS good fic potential in this concept, but like, no one ever runs with it. fuck 😔

398,t3_gcs9je,FanFiction,I have been misreading a tag for years,"Ever since I've started using ao3 I've always read the tag 'canon compliant' as 'canon complaint', as in ""There's something I didn't like about canon so I'm fixing it"", but a post on here made me realise it actually means ""This fic doesn't contradict canon"". I did think it was a bit weird how fics tagged with this didn't always fix problems with canon, except some characters not being together... but it didn't occur to me to look into the tag more.

 This is not the first time I've misread something, but I'm surprised I didn't notice for so long. The most memorable example is when my brain just skipped a major character death tag because the fandom didn't have many stories that would really need warnings. I expected it to end like ""Oh he's fine, he just got caught up in something :)))""  but no. I actually cried my god. That was probably one of the best fics I've ever read though, definitely for that fandom. I'm actually somewhat glad I missed the tag because a) I might not have read it and b) it spoils the ending.

Tagged as discussion because I'm curious if anyone else has completely misread a tag or misunderstood its meaning, and if this has actually enhanced a story   in some way."
399,t3_gd3yfh,FanFiction,Am i the only one who feels this way?,"Writing Fanfiction has been both a good and bad thing for me - am i the only one who feels this way?

I don't know if this is the right place to vent about this but i am just wondering if it is just me.

I enjoy reading stories, whether it be fanfics or original stories. Basically, consuming any form of entertainment brought by the world of fiction and imagination.

I started writing fanfiction more often around 2-3 years ago. It has brought me joy because wow, even though i admit they're cringe and i am not the best writer out there, it still made me happy thanks to the reviews/comments people have left there. And honestly, i didn't really think anyone really and actually read and saw some sort of 'potential' through my fics until i received a long review full of constructive criticism. I wasn't despondent by it, i was just shocked someone took the time to give me such a long constructive and structured feedback and it just made me slightly more motivated to better the fanfic as i didn't really take it 100% seriously haha... ~~the plot-holes i've yet to fill tell me so-~~. In summary, writing fanfictions, exploring characters and AUs just brought me joy and gave me something like a hobby as opposed to staring at YouTube with a blank mind for who knows how long haha. It even became a form of coping mechanism for real life problems; escapism. And that's somewhat where the bad part begins.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing as a coping mechanism may not be a bad thing for everyone, but for me, eh

I wouldn't say my life problems are the worst out there but well... yeah. I won't go into detail but due to life issues, i've been writing fanfictions for the sake of escapism. And mainly, this causes issues with my school-work. My grades used to be fine, but i've lost motivation due to personal reasons (i.e. parents forcing me to pursue a path i have little to no interest, and am now in a place i don't want to be. That's all i'll say.) and i've been becoming a slacker. Instead of thinking how to sort my life out, how i can work my way out, i just write/read fanfics to ignore my problems thinking ""It's tomorrow's problem."", ""I can't care anymore."" ; things and thoughts like these weren't an issue 2-3 years ago when my writing became more frequent, maybe because life wasn't shit yet and i found a balance to which i have now lost.

A logical step for me to do now if i can't find a balance would be to *abandon* the world of fanfiction (at least the writing part). But i can't, especially when i still have fanfics that are ongoing, people are waiting. But it isn't just that. My self-esteem has been quite low, and while i have real-life friendships, i often turn to the internet / internet strangers for help instead of them because they're either somewhat toxic or aren't so comfortable with hearing my problems- which is fine, fair enough everyone has their own problems so i can't judge on that.

 But then upon entering the writing side of fanfiction, receiving positive and excited reviews just felt so great. Admittedly, it felt nice to just wake up to a positive review and i'd just look forward to it because *damn, does it feel good to feel appreciated and not worthless or stupid.* It felt good to have some form of purpose like wow someones waiting for what i am creating (even if i think it's trashy lmao like wow people actually like this? ) 

And while i am aware of the severe consequences if i choose to continue to neglect my studies and real life as a whole, i can't stop because this form of escapism has became too addicting especially after life became sour for me.

I'm not really asking for advice, but if you do give it'll be nice. But what i am asking is just - is it just me who is like this? Lmao, or am i just a unique snowflake mESs haha"

401,t3_gd5hkd,FanFiction,Dear God Help Me...100k and counting.,"I was crunching the numbers of my Burning Stars series and thinking to myself 'Why can't I write this much during NaNoWriMo?' and also thinking 'OMG! What have I done'.

I'm at about 120k words in my series, and I'm only maybe at MOST a third done. X( If even that much. I created this story in my head all during the holidays then set out to finally write it in order to get it out of my head. Now I don't know how I'm ever going to finish.

I do a good ten to twenty pages every time I sit down to write, which is a huge feat, but I can't write every day, maybe couple days a week, then I can't look at my writing at all. I'm in one of those slumps again I think. Advice? I never knew I was so inspired by Star Trek...&gt;\_\_&gt;

I almost don't want to start writing anything for any other fandoms until this is done, but it will NEVER BE DONE at this rate. X\_x and I keep making up new plot threads and things that fit and are all wonderful and I can't help myself. I don't have a beta reader either, I do all the editing myself, going back to fix things myself later on after I post, and just generally re-reading my own writing between writing sprees to stay inspired.

I really don't know how I've gotten this far and quit, the longest I've ever gotten on a fic is 60k or  thereabouts. A little life support is needed."
402,t3_gct9uq,FanFiction,Why do people feel like they can demand that I drastically change my fics to suit them?,"OK. Let me just outline what's happened. I have a piece of Naruto fanfiction that I immediately prefaced with a note about how my intention with the fic was not about portraying strength, but about focusing on friendships, family, identity, and realistic development. Apparently, somebody didn't get the memo. This morning, I wake up to not one, but two massive PMs about my fic. Someone has become so enraged that my fic doesn't fall into the trope that they like that they wrote a rant so long that it didn't fit into one PM. Apparently, they love the plot and the premise, but my apparent failure to make Naruto godlike has, I quote, ""EFFING RUNED THE ENTRE EFING FIC!!!!"" (sic) This person has repeated themselves multiple times throughout this rant, and they have failed to reason exactly why I should want to follow this trope. The entire rant essentially all boils down to, ""I like this trope, so you have to write this trope specifically for me. You are stupid because you have not already done what I want, and I am angry about it. Grr.""

I'm sort of halfway between being mildly bothered by this person's audacity (I am writing this for free, for my own enjoyment, not for this person, and if they didn't like it, there are easily thousands of other fics that they can read that follow the trope that they're looking for, or they could even write their own), and laughing hysterically because someone out there thinks that this is an appropriate thing to demand.

I honestly have nothing against this trope and the people who like it. Making a character OP is an insanely popular trope. It's just not something that I personally want to write. My interests lie in other areas. What I don't understand is why people feel as though they have a right to tell me what I am and am not allowed to write. It's not their fic. I am not writing solely for them. I don't even know them. Why do they think that I suddenly owe them a fic written to their specifications?

404,t3_gd78by,FanFiction,Could I please get an honest opinion regarding my fic’s summary?,"Okay, so I’m starting to think my fic’s summary might not be working As well as I had hoped. I was going for something that gave the basic plot without being too on the nose, but it seems that I may have made it too vague.

&amp;#x200B;

**What does it mean to be brave? What does it mean to be a coward? An MIT graduate from our world will soon discover what it means to be both as he is pulled into a dangerous game of minds by Azula, who seeks to exploit his knowledge of Earth's technologies for her own dark purposes.**

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was alright but now I don’t know. I think for me, the biggest problem is that it puts more emphasis on the OC rather than Azula.

&amp;#x200B;

So I’ve written a second summary, one the puts all the attention on Azula.

&amp;#x200B;

**On the day of her 14th birthday, Princess Azula received a gift like no other; a mysterious object of unknown origin that glowed brighter than fire when touched a certain way. For some, it was little more than a pretty trinket. For others it was just an esoteric puzzle waiting to be solved.** 

**But for Azula herself, it would became a window into a world beyond even her comprehension; a world of glittering cities of glass and steel and lights, filled with technological marvels and wonders to make even the Fire Nation look primitive by comparison.**

**And now that she has had her first glimpse into this strange new world, The Fire Princess will not rest until she had reshaped her own in its image, where the power of technology is the only element that matters.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m liking this new summary so far, but now wonder it it’s a bit too wordy.  


What do you guys think?

I appreciate the help."
405,t3_gd63gy,FanFiction,Overdone crossovers and stretching the definition of crossovers,"I had the idea of doing a crossover of halo and mass effect which is pretty overdone but I was thinking of adding a bit of twist to it and not have it be a direct crossover and more the two universes overlapping at different points.
Like having commander Shepard and covering the broad strokes of events from the original trilogy but now having to contend with the covenant thrown into the mix, maybe having to uncover things about the reapers while the citadel council and the covenant engage each other in a Cold War.
Then have the story skip ahead again to master chief and the broad strokes events of the original halo trilogy.
I am kinda worried it’d be just a rehash of the original stories but with extra stuff but things could maybe deviate more, first contact between humans and the covenant be centuries earlier, the mass effect races and the UNSC working together, stuff like that."

I’m working on a fanfic (since I’m really bored and this idea came to me out of nowhere) It doesn’t have anything from the original story at all, just the characters since I love the characters from this show. It’s set in my own universe.

I had a question for fanfic writers. Do you generally finish writing the story first and then upload it? Or do you upload it while still working on it?

I’m worried that my story is going to be really short. I’m still plotting it out and I don’t think it should be short, but I’m worried that my writing skills aren’t going to cut it and it’s going to turn out super short since I sometimes rush through plot points and solve conflicts too quickly 

which is why I was wondering if I should just write it all first.

I guess it's less whether to use a trope or not, because I have one already in my story that's kind of canon. The story basically switches a canon ' hate to love' couple from the past, for a different set of characters from the future. 

When I originally started this story, I layed the ground for this new trope but now I'm not sure whether I want to keep it or not. I started the story because it was something I wanted to read (tacky or not, I love tropes), but now I don't want to disappoint any readers by overloading the story with one too many. 

The plots were very subtle so they could easily be brushed away, or I could ride this train to station on full-throttle. I'm not sure what to do, any ideas?"

I don't like the formatting on fanfiction.net anymore, I just find it harder to read. I don't even have an account. But I've been writing more, and I wonder if I should be cross-posting.

There have been some real gems that I've found on FFN that aren't on ao3, and it makes me kind of sad that I can't bookmark them with all my other faves. So I just don't want to be that fic for other people. 

Also, I really like the way that FFN authors have works in progress listed and generally just more personal profiles, which I don't see as often on ao3.

The one it was clear to me;

\-She will always be better than the canon characters 

\- She [speaks several languages fluently](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot).  

\- Her skills will often be unrealistic within the story's setting 

\- She's [incorruptible](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness) 

\- She is almost never depicted as putting any effort into *maintaining* her impossibly ""perfect"" body 

\-  She's a perfect judge of character, and she'll be right about everyone 

\- She's [So Beautiful](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse) 

\- [Mary Sue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue) is introduced with an incredibly detailed description of her every physical feature 

\- If Mary Sue is *not* on screen, the characters will be talking about her anyway 

To be honest, i was kind of aware some of them but i justify it by her superpower origin (which i can oversimplfy for you by saying ""she is from another dimension so usually by the time the story happens in the fandom she didn't even exist beforehand. Thus her powers and unusual traits belongs to that dimension""). So it wouldn't bother the reader. At least that's what i thought. Now that i read this i'm biased. But, she's the antagonist. So in the end of the stories she'll be taken down by my other OC(let's call him Protag for now). But i was thinking to start the story with how powerful she is and intentionally make it blury which one is protagonist and which one is antagonist  

So is it still mary sue? Should i concern about other OC (Protag) more? Is it depends on something i'm missing here?"

417,t3_gcwy79,FanFiction,Developing a character beyond canon and writing about unfamiliar situations,"Something I struggle with when writing fanfiction is imagining characters in situations that are unlike anything that’s ever happened in the canon. For example, let’s say the original material never deals with any romantic themes. But now I’m trying to write about a canon character in a romantic situation. It’s really hard to imagine how the character would behave because there’s nothing to go off of. No matter which way I write that scene, it feels out of character.

Do you guys have any tips on how I could approach these types of scenes? Is my understanding of the character simply not good enough if I can’t imagine how they would act?

The second part of my question refers to fanfiction where a character starts out the way they were canonically portrayed but over the course of the story, they grow/mature as a person and change. This really puts me out of my comfort zone too. I’d say I’m pretty good at analyzing a character’s behavior and motives and “mimicking” what I’ve seen or read in my own story. But when the character develops, I feel a bit lost. I want to keep a good balance between recognizable behavior (i.d. I want readers and myself to recognize the character as the person they’ve come to know and love) and showing how they’ve grown.

I’d appreciate some input or maybe just hearing that I’m not the only one struggling with this."

When I talk to people about it, they always give me some reason why he is great and cool, and they can relate or whatever.

To me he is pure evil, and his redemption is completely unearned. The character doesn’t work at all.

My idea, to illustrate this, is writing a 10031 chapter fan fiction (with an epilogue and prologue) detailing the murder of ever single Misaka clone, in gory detail to show how a person couldn’t possible murder that many people with their bare hands and still be called human.

Some chapters maybe be short (just a few hundred words), some will be dragged out.

420,t3_gcuwdk,FanFiction,How did you discover fan fiction?,"My introduction to fanfic was at a Star Trek convention when I was in college, way back in the day. I was browsing the dealers' tables and came across actual, bound fanzines (this was pre-Internet, folks)  of another favorite show, and I was struck dumb by the idea there were fans out there who actually wanted to continue the series by writing fiction about it and putting it in printed format for everyone else to enjoy. What a concept!

So I purchased a couple, ordered several more and was eventually inspired to write one myself later on which even got published in a fanzine, then another with an email collaborator for a mailing list's Virtual Season project. Then I found webpages and archives with fanfic of even more shows I knew and loved, and that was it. I've never regretted it since.

See, I've been a reader all my life (taught myself before I knew how to walk, even) and discovering a new source for stories was utterly amazing. I now read an equal amount of professionally printed and fan-made fiction feeling no shame whatsoever. Though I have to admit here I'm not comfortable talking about *anything* I read or write in face-to-face conversations. But then, I'm not good with small talk anyway.

For a while I got busy with one RL thing and another, and it wasn't until about six years ago I discovered AO3 and FF, took a hard look at my earlier stories and decided they stood the test of time, polished them off a bit more and posted to both sites. Then I wrote some more because it's fun and a great way to keep my mind off the problems of RL.

Currently I'm in the middle of a major WIP with well over a 100,000 words and (soon to be posted) 24 chapters and enjoying myself immensely. Reading and writing fanfic has saved my sanity more than once in these trying times.

Thanks for reading! Now what I want to know is, how did *you* discover fanfic?"

422,t3_gd58qg,FanFiction,A possible idea for a story.,"Hi, I’m new on this subreddit and I wanted to ask if my story idea is any good. I’m sorta new to writing long, well-thought out stories so it may not sound very good or it just sounds like cringe.
 This is a story set in a parallel version of Scott Cawthon’s Five Nights at Freddy’s universe. The story finds our main protagonist lost and alone in a world where he feels like an outcast. He was a former employee of the Fazbear Entertainment company before it hit rock-bottom. Twenty years after the last Freddy’s goes out of business, new entrepreneurs are trying to restructure the brand for a new generation. Our character finds himself swept up in this grand-reopening, taking the night watch, and seeing horrific relics from the past brought before his eyes.
 If it sounds good to the members of this subreddit, I’ll continue this personal project of mine. I may even post a more descriptive summary of it."
423,t3_gd2qtf,FanFiction,What makes a Sue/Stu?,"This is a question I've asked myself on multiple occasions.  A little while ago, I wrote a Cross Ange fic to pass the time and when I looked at what I had planned regarding my main OC, I realized there was no way I could write him as anything other than a total Stu.  But I was bored so I decided ""screw it I'll just have fun with it.""  To my surprise, people were surprisingly accepting of both him and the story in general.  So if you wind up making a Sue/Stu without intending to, does that mean you can make a non-Sue/Stu by intending to make them a Sue/Stu?

And what makes a Sue/Stu anyway?  I honestly feel a character can be attractive, intelligent, heroic, and capable and still be a good character.  Look at All Might for instance.  For all intents and purposes he should be a Stu.  But he's not because Horikoshi deconstructs the sort of effect someone like him would have on society as well as the pressure to live up to how that society perceives him.  It also helps that he's not entirely invincible.  On the other hand, look at MCU Captain Marvel.  Now I love the MCU films but her movie left a lot to be desired.  The entire thing was just a promotion for how powerful and great a hero she was which resulted in a boring movie and a rather flat character.  Perhaps that's the defining trait between a good character and a Sue/Stu.  It's not a question of how powerful they are but rather if they exist for the story or the story exists for them. "

I am a massive fan of the series Code Geass, and ever since finishing it a couple of years ago I've been working on a retelling of the story, fixing a lot of the problems I had with the plot and how the world itself worked. After looking through the works people have posted for this both of FFN and AO3 I haven't really seen any works that majorly change the way the world works, well not any way that don't bring in over the top fixes that fundamentally 'change' how the universe operates. Not that this is a bad thing by any means, some of them are my favourite stories, just that they are not what I'm going for.  
Call this self validation if you will, I'm just not in a space at the moment where I want to use what energy I have creating a polished piece of work to submit if I don't think anyone will enjoy the direction I am taking the story. This isn't so much a question of 'should I make this' as 'do people like this'. I will be writing it up for my own pleasure regardless, because I have issues with the story and believe that I can fix some of those (and I somehow got my teacher to let me write this for an assignment), however with the state of my mental health at the moment I would prefer not to put the amount of effort my mind would demand into a piece of work that no one in the community would actually appreciate.  
If this is not the right place to post this, or if it is in some other way inappropriate please let me know, I just decided I would post this to let my mind have a break worrying over this."

I spent hours plotting this story, chatting about the plot to another friend and just generally grinding out every ounce of me to write this thing. It mounted to 13k of words and a few of my friends favourite tropes (friends to enemies to lovers, angst, pinning etc). 

But then once I had posted it, I felt no happiness or relief. What I felt was utter sadness and disgust, I felt sick to the stomach and like everything was meaningless. Not necessarily that the story was bad, but in general that everything was awful about the entire writing as an art. 

So I napped, I curled up in bed and slept because I just wanted to get away from writing, plots, story building and characters. Anything that reminded me of writing made me feel sick and I wasn’t going to be okay with that feeling.

There was an author on Quizilla back in the day (I wanna say between 2007-2008, give or take a year on either side) called **lifesucksandthenudie**. They wrote an original fic, pretty lemony, called **Take My Innocence** about two emo stereotypical emo boys, Matt and Ryan, who fall in love. Then another boy, Alex, moves into the neighborhood and begins this kind of rapey/coercive sexual relationship with Matt and forces him to keep it a secret. Real psycho character. I remember his motive for tormenting Matt being that he was actually in love with Ryan and was somehow using Matt to...I don't even know, I don't remember it 100% making sense at the time.

Anyway. The author ended up writing several series in this universe before leaving Quizilla I think. The last series was called **Forget Me Not**. They moved all their fics to [FanFiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net) (I'm fairly positive it was this and not FictionPress) and had a Tumblr before kind of dropping off the map, but I can't remember their username from those two accounts.

I've never been able to find the fics again—does this ring a bell to anyone, or know where to find them? Couldn't seem to search FanFiction using the Wayback Machine.

Once I ignored those and tried moving on, someone (or perhaps a group of people) keep on doing what my friends and I call 'ringing the doorbell' incessantly. Sometimes for up to 12-15 times a day, someone subs to me, unsubs, and then very quickly subs back, rinse and repeat the damn cycle.

438,t3_gcrukk,FanFiction,"passing 30,000 hits","i’ve written fanfiction for myself for a few years now but always been far too anxious to post it anywhere public or let anyone, including friends/family, read it

about six months ago i started posting my first wip. for the first month or so i struggled so badly with the anxiety of having it up that i seriously considered unpublishing it every few days at the least. if i didn’t panic over it twice a week at a minimum it was a miracle. although i loved writing it, the fight of keeping it public was draining for me.

but it’s officially been six months since posting the first part and yesterday it passed 30,000 hits. no, that’s not an insane number, but i called my girlfriend (still the only person irl that knows about my fanfiction) and just started crying. she was predictably lovely. 

i didn’t expect to get so emotional or become so invested in this thing i do for no other reason than the fact that i love doing it, that it makes me happy, and that it’s helped me get over so much fear. 

i understand the fear of posting your own writing. it can feel vulnerable and personal and uncomfortable, but i’ve never been prouder of overcoming a significant anxiety. fanfiction is such a source of joy, whether you’re reading or writing, and i’m so proud to be a part of this community ❤️

tl;dr, take the risk. in all likelihood no one will be anything but kind, and you might grow in ways you don’t expect."

440,t3_gcimoj,FanFiction,Can people please properly tag their stuff?,"This is an extremely petty vent, because in this case I'm not talking about untagged gore or rape or any of that nasty stuff. In one of my fandoms on Ao3 it is *extremely* popular to write stories set in alternate universes, and it is nigh-impossible to sort them out at a glance. *""Oh, this looks interesting -- oh, it's a college/high school/coffee shop AU.""* Ad nauseum. Can I get my fantastical setting back please?

Of course this isn't to bash on people who enjoy these kinds of stories. It is just very frustrating to differentiate them from non-AU stories, due to a combination of freeform tags (making the filter system ineffective) and plain ol' not tagging at all."

I don't know if I should keep on reading or just stop. I feel amazing and a warm feeling every time I read a story and after I finish I want to read another one right away.

445,t3_gcpvgl,FanFiction,Fiction vs Fanfiction?,"So, the other day I had an idea for a Harry Potter fanfic that I've been obsessing over for a bit now. Only issue is, I don't know if I'm stretching the term ""fanfiction"" too far, or if an entirely new setting and characters would have anybody interested.

Here's the short of it:

It is set a while after Voldemort is defeated, and takes place out in Wyoming, United States. It's a small, secluded town that is kept hidden from muggles by a natural magic made by its founders [I was thinking of it being imbued into the natural landscape, like the trees or sand surrounding the town]. It's made up of witches and wizards who have almost no connection to the outside world.

How they perform, learn, and practice magic would be today different from that of Hogwarts or the other big schools. Maybe they don't use wands, but found something else to channel the magic. Maybe it's the parents job to teach the kids, since they don't have any big magic school to go to. It would be a way to explore all the ""what-ifs"" about magic in general, and how it might develop somewhere new. 

That definitely isn't everything, but kind of my starting place to develop. I'm wanting to have some kind of disturbance happen around the town, so someone from the Ministry of Magic would come to investigate, and show how different things work around there. 

Only issue I'm having is this: is this too far to be fanfiction? Or, better yet, would fanfiction readers be interested in such a different story from the books? It would be a whole new setting and characters, and I'm not sure if I'm alienating the audience too much. 

Would it just be better to make it fiction instead, take out the HP bits?

All advice welcomed!"

451,t3_gcntl6,FanFiction,Do I want a beta?,"The title sounds weird, but it's basically what I want to know.

I'm fairly new to writing fanfic, but in the two to three weeks or so I've started a WIP, I've been posting about once every two days, so now I have 14 chapters and about 42k words. I've started getting worried about pacing and character development (the main character's an OC) so, after reading through all the posts about getting a beta, I decided to look for one through the Beta Bartering system here.

I've managed to find someone who looked through thirteen chapters and gave me feedback on what I was looking for (and she was a huge, *huge* help), but she wasn't in my fandom so I said I'd look for another beta who was. But then I started beta-ing for someone else, and well, I'm not sure that's what I want?

I'm not saying I don't know what a beta is and that I don't think I'm doing a good job - he seemed perfectly happy with what I do. What I'm trying to say is that I'm not sure whether a 'beta' is what I want. I don't want help with SPAG (I make mistakes sometimes but who doesn't? Besides, the person who looked through my fic said any mistakes were minor enough - though I will be looking through the chapters later to sort them out) and I don't need someone to look through every chapter before I post. 

What I *do* want is someone to look through my fic occasionally (probably about every five chapters in - that's when I start getting insecure about my writing in general) and tell me if the plot's dragging or if characters are acting oddly. Someone who can, also, occasionally help if I get stuck on an idea would be great as well. 

The thing is, I'm not sure if what I want is better described as a reviewer or a beta. I assumed it was closer to the latter, but from what I've gathered, betas are more of an on-going thing (for long fics) that look at chapters *before* writers post.

To sum it all up: if I'm looking for someone to check-in once in a while if my writing's going in the right direction, am I looking for a beta?"

* If you share content with sex or gore or heavy violence, please put ""NSFW"" next to your fandom.  Right at the top of the comment, so it's visible.

I’ll keep this brief so it doesn’t border into relationships txt but: I recently started writing explicit fanfic. My s/o of four years doesn’t watch anime but he occasionally reads my sfw fanfic to be supportive. He knows I read hella romance novels, and as of last night knows I write nsfw content bc I mentioned it. He’s not a very sexual person whereas I really really am, which is why I read and write as a sort of outlet. However, the idea of him reading it makes me uncomfortable. Since he has a link to my aO3, I’m nervous about uploading it there (it’s currently on tumblr).

My explanation probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but that's the best way I can describe it.

Depur begs forgiveness for having been Depur. Ar-Amu refuses. I'm not sure what else they talked about, but ultimately Depur offered his face to Ekkreth as a disguise, to help Ekkreth free more slaves. 

Does anyone know this story? It's been a while, and I may be getting some details wrong, but the main thing is Depur repents, and offers his face as a disguise.

At first I thought it was just the multichapter stories that were missed out, but that was not the case. the *newer* multichapter stories (i.e. the ones with a more recent initial publication date) were still getting posted about whenever a new chapter was uploaded, but the older multichapter stories (eg. a story initially published in 2018 which has many new chapters posted in 2020) are not being posted about at all.

That's not the point.

The point is is that I do *horrendous* with attention but I love posting stuff, getting feedback, and making people happy. I hate the expectations that come with it, and the eyes that are on you constantly.

The last longfics I posted I killed them. They're dead in the water, orphaned and forgotten forever, stopped midway. And I'm scared I'll do that again because, this time, I have about thirty friends between tumblr and discord who know me pretty damn personally. I even know one of these people in real life.

I'm fucking terrified. I hate this, and I don't want it to get popular. Hopefully it doesn't, but because our show is on a hiatus and will *hopefully* be renewed for its second season, I'm suspecting people will want to read to fill the months long gap...

Does anyone else have this issue? And if so, how the *hell* do you deal with it? Deal with the fear of not being good enough, of judgement, of rejection, of becoming a disappointment if you slip up or mess up...?

I use it to label each of my fics in the stage of the writing process they're in (outlining, writing, editing, or up next) and I linked to my Trello board on both my Fanfiction and AO3 profiles, but I recently had someone PM me on Fanfiction to let me know that they can't access Trello for some reason (I don't think their internet is allowing them to open the website for some weird reason) and asked if I had any tips to help them see it. I wasn't sure if anyone was actually using my Trello, but I'm so glad to know that people (at least one) have been using it to stay up to date on my stories. Regardless, I enjoy updating it, it helps me just as much as it helps my readers, and I hope that my readers do actually use it to stay up to date on my stories.

Since this reader reached out to me, I've started wondering how many of my other readers might have similar issues and I'm considering finding an alternative platform to use to update them. I'll probably keep my Trello because I really do like the platform and I've been considering making alternate boards to start organizing my stories.

If the piece in question is a 'traditional' piece, could a translation be paraphrased and be considered legal? Because from what I understand, a translation would be still considered lyrics. Even if the piece may be in the public domain, the translation may not be? Or am I mistaken?

But haha I received a few notifications that some people have subscribed to my fics. No favourite author, no fave story, just the subscription (this is on FFN).

I went to stalk their profiles because I'm curious like that and noticed that they're fans of a very common popular ship in my fandom (these fans were also well-known for bashing my ship during the fandom's heyday, though I personally never got any negative reviews). Their fave authors and stories all centre around that particular popular ship.

Yet they still subscribed to my story. I suppose they could be the kind who's okay with reading other pairs (but given my experiences this really usually isn't the case).

I've also had people admit to me before that they hate my ship but the writing is so good that they just swap the characters for their favourite pair. Which is kind of strange but also flattering I guess?

So yeah, this is it, this is my entire spiel. I really like it when I can make people who dislike my ship secretly read and follow my work because it's like admitting that I write that well haha.

477,t3_gcgexk,FanFiction,Thoughts/Advice on long-form Relationship/Slice Of Life-ish Fic?,"I am outlining a fic that involves a couple that has a goal to achieve that requires them to venture out into the world together. It isn't pressing or urgent and instead serves as a background plot. Instead the story focuses on this couple and how they adapt from a relationship that begins in an educational setting to one in the real world. They deal with insecurities and personality flaws that weren't apparent prior to their journey. They also deal with the fact that they are adults now not kids and some coming-of-age elements. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say long-form, but I don't think this would be more than 20 chapters and even that might be overestimating it a tad. Presently I'm torn between having the plot lead to a break-up and getting back together after solving their own personal problems and complete the task at hand, or having the couple lean on each other to help the other overcome their issues and therefore ending the story with a stronger relationship than in the beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

For something like this, would you solve the external plot of the journey before the relationship plot or vice versa? And would that depend on which way I took the relationship plot? Should I flesh out and plot in more dynamics to the relationship plot like a romantic rival/ex to keep it more engaging, or am I overthinking it?

482,t3_gcgr84,FanFiction,Starting my next fanfiction...,"Hey guys. I'm thinking of starting the sequel to my first fanfiction, and whilst a part of me REALLY wants to do it. It hasn't been a week since I finished it, and I feel like if I don't take enough of a break (at least one more week) then I'll get burnt out and lose interest in completing it early on, which is something I don't want to do at all.

So I'm conflicted. Do I trust the part of my that wants to get back into it already? Or do I trust the safe part of me that wants to take a further break to ensure that I won't get a burnout? Anyone who has written a second fanfic sometime after their first would probably be able to help me out here. Thank you!"
483,t3_gc1i6k,FanFiction,Why do some authors delete their fics?,"To give some context: I've been searching for this fic for pretty much forever, but it was deleted on AO3 and I haven't been able to find it anywhere, including on the Wayback Machine, which is strange since it was a fairly popular fic. I've finally decided to put the search to rest.

But I can't help but wonder why the author deleted it. I don't want to be invasive, so I haven't asked her since she obviously has her reasons (and she's not that active online either), but I'm still curious. The fic did fairly well, to say the least, was loved by many members of the community, was recced in multiple lists, she even commissioned art for it, but then... it was just taken down. I have no idea why. She didn't take a break from the fandom either, she continued to write for it immediately after she deleted the fic, under the same name. It wasn't the ship that was the issue either- she mentioned it in a couple of Tumblr posts, and there's even a drabble for it on her account. It wasn't just some story she'd written as a teenager and was embarrassed about years later.

It's almost as though the fic never existed. There are no mentions of it on her Tumblr. After it was deleted, nobody else in the fandom mentioned it. The only proof it existed is a reblogged post with one of the art commissions, and multiple rec lists.

I really don't mean to be rude at all, but does anybody have any idea why a fic might be deleted in this way? Or if you've deleted a fic, what was your reason?

Again, I don't mean to be rude, and it's totally up to you if you want to remove your work. I'm just curious, and I am hoping for some closure since I've spent way too much time searching for this fic.

Edit: at one point the author did say it was probably her favourite thing she's written.

Also, I did send an ask to her back in April 2019 but since then she's become pretty much inactive on Tumblr and AO3, so not hoping for much on that front.

Edit, again: Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences and opinions!

If anyone is curious, I've basically concluded that the author in question probably deleted the fic to rework it into her original work, since that would explain pretty much everything."
484,t3_gcsdch,FanFiction,"A message to all writers: If you lose interest in a project, please don't flip out and delete all traces of it","So there was an AU Attack on Titan fic I've been following for about a year. It was definitely a long one, book 1-book 2 type deal. The author seemed a dickhead because he rarely responded to my reviews (there was a random commentator who always did who I thought was the guy but I digress) so I should've realized something was up.

So the story goes on hiatus a couple months ago, I think ""No big deal, I'll just check in later."" I come back a few days ago and there is no story. No announcement, no A/N, no fanfare. Guy just deleted his novel long before it was concluded. His author buddy is currently reuploading the parts that were finished for some reason, not even all at once.

We're all writers, yeah? I totally understand losing interest in something, even if it totally had a decent following but it hurts so much more that he tried to stealth kill it. And the radio silence bugs the shit out of me too. I know dude's alive at least because his actual magnum opus is still going but man was that annoying. Don't be like him folks, at least address it."
485,t3_gcag5f,FanFiction,Unhealthy relationships/Co-dependency/Love-Hate tropes,"Hi all,

Am trying to find some fics with unhealthy relationship/co-dependency dynamics. What are some of the best you've read? No matter what pairing. I'm digging the love-hate tropes -- the kind where they are dysfunctionally in love, but there's too much baggage, and they can't get away from each other, but they are maybe not good for each other either, very mutually destructive, but also mutually saving each other -- the complex kind. Any suggestions would be very welcome."
486,t3_gceqoy,FanFiction,Original Fic vs Smut Version of Fic,"Has this happened to anyone else? I have two Fics that take place in the same world, except one is the sexual side and the other focusing on other mishaps in the story. The smut version has more traffic than the original version. Do people like smut that much? lol"

488,t3_gci4zd,FanFiction,Is it normal to clump your one-shots into one book?,"I have about 9 ideas and more floating around in my mind at the moment and it just seems like a waste to not clump them together in one book, y'know? What does everyone think?

Edit: 2 people are for it and 2 are against. Interesting."
489,t3_gc8a3m,FanFiction,so. I have a conundrum.,"I have this fic that I wrote about 6 months ago and have been updating regularly (I haven't updated it in April at all though), and I decided to reread it to see if anything needed changing. 

You know that specific feeling where you re-read your own fic and go, ""Wow I can't believe I wrote that, it's so good""? Well, me re-reading it was like that, but the exact opposite. I *know* I'm a better writer now, and I can't help noticing how many words I've overused, and how much better it would be if I wrote it now. 

It now has 11 chapters and I really want to rewrite the entire thing - but it has more than 100 subscribers, and I really don't want to delete the entire thing and re-upload it, you know? But if I just rewrite the entire thing and just update it, I feel like I'm dissapointing my subscribers and also would scare away anyone new who would want to read it. 

Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks."
490,t3_gcdnte,FanFiction,Having a problem with AO3 bookmark collections,"(Not sure what flair to use for this, sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

I've never actually made a collection on AO3 but I recently wanted to bookmark some works and make collections for them for easier navigation. I made one collection, then bookmarked a fanfic and tried to add it to that collection. However, for some reason when I tried to type in my collection name it wouldn't show up. Has anyone else had this problem?"
491,t3_gckdxh,FanFiction,Any illustrators looking to collab?,"Hello! So I'm looking for someone who does digital art who would like to make comics with me. I'm great at coming up with stories and drawing single images. But repeat and panel art in general is really difficult for me.

Before anyone asks, no this wouldn't be a paid gig kind of thing. I just want to actually get a story out there and work with a person or team for fun too.

Preferably I'd like to work with someone who draws stylistically more or less like anime, or kind of cartoon comic.

If you're interested please PM me!"
492,t3_gcextz,FanFiction,I think I may have to write a smut scene for a fic...,"And I don’t want to! I think I may just imply it, but one of the characters is a rape victim and I want it to not seem forced.

What do I do? Do I bite my tongue and write the scene? Or do I imply it and try to make it seem natural?"
493,t3_gcjgzj,FanFiction,What is a good kudos/hits ratio?,For both reading and writing- what ratio is indicative of a good fic/what’s a good ratio for you to achieve?
494,t3_gc7goa,FanFiction,Revealing Mysteries within the Plot,"So I'm in a bit of a dilemma here. My fic has been steadily going well, but now I've reached somewhat of a ""roadblock"" that has kept me stuck for over a week now.

So far, I have planned to make small bits of clues that have the main characters slowly unravel the mastermind behind all the events happening around them. The problem is how I'm going to depict that reveal, in an attempt to appeal to my readers. There are two ways I found but I'm unable to find which one is better.

&amp;#x200B;

* Have a section told from the POV of the villains, as they reveal to the readers that they were behind everything all along. I've seen plenty of stories in books, movies, comics that use this to success but I'm still doubtful.
* Having the protagonists discover the clues themselves through in-fic events. This one I'm leaning more towards to since it also promotes reader engagement.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is which may be the best way to deliver that ""punch"" to the reader and make a big impact on my story? I want to avoid lowering their enjoyment of my story or even outright ruining it. If there are other suggestions or tips besides the ones I mentioned, I'm all ears."
495,t3_gbr0s6,FanFiction,Someone just went through and commented on almost every posted chapter of my current project.,"As well as the first fic in the series that this project is part of. I have 18 unread comments in my AO3 inbox right now.

498,t3_gbn45d,FanFiction,This wasn’t tea...,"I was writing a scene where a character goes on about tea. I spent the next ten minutes looking up how tea can loose its flavor in relation to hot and cold water before I went back to finish the scene.

Thats when I reach for my hot mug. I expected tea and forgot I was drinking dolce Leche coffee.   I reflexively spit it up all over my shirt and parts onto my Bluetooth keyboard. Sigh. I cant be the only one something like this happened to."
499,t3_gcd9f4,FanFiction,Have you ever not watched a show because there's no fanfiction?,"This is a weird thing with me, many older cartoons and live action shows have premises that I'm sure I would enjoy watching. However, I'll often not watch them simply because I don't see the fanfic side of the fandom as very active. 

For example 6teen, I remember watching it as a kid and enjoying it because it was a cartoon with a catchy theme song. Unfortunately when I check out AO3 new fics are pretty scarce meaning that once I finish I won't have much to keep engaging with. Anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?"
500,t3_gc6vui,FanFiction,FFN activity decline?,"Have you noticed a decline in FFN activity? I cross post on AO3 and FFN and my AO3 posting has gotten 2x the amount of views the FFN post has. Same content, same story/fandom, updated on the same day. I know certain fandoms are more active on certain platforms, but I was curious if anyone else has noticed something similar, especially after the new ads they have on FFN."
501,t3_gc54md,FanFiction,20 kudos and counting,"So even though I have not touched my story in like 6 months, I still got some kudos. Strangely enough, yesterday night began writing a new chapter, and even though it hasn't been posted yet, as it isn't finished, I got the last kudos so far. I am glad people are still liking the story despite it being in hiatus!"
502,t3_gbzdjj,FanFiction,What are your no-go tags?,"I hope this was not asked before, because I couldn't find a post about this. 

What are the tags that make you go: nope! 
Give me all, from you get a bit annoyed to straight up recoiling in horror.
I don't want to kink kinkshame, whatever tickles your pickle, mate. I'm simply interested in what others dont like to read. 
What makes a whole nice description sour for you with just one tag?

So here are mine:
Mpreg, 
Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics, 
Magic made them do it, 
AU (light canon divergence is ok, but no AU Highschool or AU Moviestars or whatever)


Edit: added commas

Edit Edit: thank you for reminding me of even more tags I hate like: Crossovers (unrealistic ones), Age gap, OCs, OOC, Knotting, Mating Cycles/In heat, Soulmates, Gender bending (nothing against trans characters,  but stuff like female!Harry Potter)"
503,t3_gc7ygb,FanFiction,Shooting yourself in the foot: your most questionable tags,"Given all the recent discussion about tags we won't read or don't like, I thought it would be fun to think about the tags for our own fics that might, let's just say, be hindering our stories' attempts to find an audience 😂

So, I'll start. Here's my most notoriously tagged fic:

Mystery, Case Fic, Alternate Universe, Non-Traditional Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics, Gender Issues, Sexual Politics, Discrimination, Dystopia, Implied/Referenced Rape/Non-con, Implied/Referenced Child Abuse, Consent Issues, Sexual Assault, Weird Biology, No Rape/Non-Con Between Major Characters, Omega Character 1, Alpha Character 2, Angst and Porn, Knotting, Underage Sex, Minor Character Death, Violence

Wow, yeah... so that's a lot! It does look bad when I see everything written out in tag form. And I'm not really sure how well it reflects the actual contents of this story, exactly, but it's the system we have. 

This is not my most popular story, which is probably an understatement. Overall, I'd say the fact that it's the third part of a series, and has an extremely, extremely rare pair, may be hurting it more than the tags. But, of course, I've kind of shot myself in the foot by including literally everything that always makes it into the top ten of 'most hated tags' lists. I suppose I could've also made it a high school AU... 

But what about you? Do you have a fic with 'questionable' tags? How is it doing? Limping along? Enjoying notoriety? Despite the tags or because of them?"
504,t3_gc55kx,FanFiction,Oneshots,"Hazza... I recently finished a oneshot that was just an absolute chore to work on. I hated working on it, but when I finished it, I went onto another oneshot.

Moving onto that new oneshot just felt like a clean slate. It wasn't hard to work on and I was actually proud of how it was going! It hit 1100+ words in just two days (I'm a slow writer sometimes)...

It's not THAT big of a celebration, but it just made me happy to work on something that didn't feel boring or dead...

Not only that, but my long running (almost a year in 22 days!!) Fanfic also recently got a 5th book!

Augh, I can't believe I've hit 5 books in just one year! It just makes me feel like I achieved something!

Im so confused. I don’t have any sense of humor, im the most boring person on earth.

Has this ever happened to you ? I really dont know how to react to this lmao"
506,t3_gc61n1,FanFiction,How to recapture the joy in writing?,"What is the best way, in your opinion, to combat feeling discouraged when writing? For example, second-guessing your story and your ability to do the tale justice. 

Instead of opening up the word document and looking forward to writing, it’s a slog. And the draft comes out sounding like a slog. It’s like cooking when your heart isn’t in it: you can almost taste the meh. 

I know that writing is a very difficult thing to do. No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and the craft improves over time. Do you have tricks you use to get out of a literary funk?

Your input is appreciated, thank you in advance."

510,t3_gbxmgl,FanFiction,What’s your weirdest fic’s “origin story?”,"Hopefully that question makes sense. For me, I’m currently writing a medieval fairy tale mashup- for a modern superhero show no less- and the whole thing started when my mom found me watching an episode and commented that one of the characters “looked like Snow White.” The seed was planted. My brain immediately went “well, if she’s Snow White, this girl could be Sleeping Beauty. And wait, these two are literally shape-shifters so let’s have them be Beauty and the Beast! And wait, this dude has an evil not-quite-stepmother and two evil ex-girlfriends, he could be a genderbent Cinderella! And this could happen, and this, and this...”

Voila. A fic. All from one little comment. I’m curious whether anyone else has a story like that! Where did the idea for your weirdest fic come from? *settles in with a bowl of popcorn to hear the wild tales*"
511,t3_gc7x2m,FanFiction,just me whining abt my ao3 stats,"uhhh anyone have tips for not caring about ao3 stats? 

i posted something on ao3 on Thursday and i have 35 hits and 4 kudos and a comment that amounts to ""this is nice, but it's too short."" and it sort of hurts. 

like out of the 35 people who checked this story, only 4 thought it merited a kudo - and the one comment i have is about length, which is something im sensitive abt bc i'm really bad at writing longer stories? and at 1.2k this was the longest i've gone in a while without the story feeling drawn out. and i know that the comment is sort of a compliment because it means the reader wants more of it, but what i gave is all i have and all i want to give. and it sucks being told ur story is insufficient. 

 i understand that 1. it's only been up for a couple of days - so ... it's still really recent and it takes time for responses to rack up, 2. it's for a big fandom so maybe it's not being seen bc its being buried in everything else uploaded since then, 3. it's a short one-shot, so unless i post another chapter the responses i do get will crawl, 4. for all i know the hits could be from fewer than 35 readers and idk the people who kudo'd it could be rereading it or something, or from people who ""marked it for later"" to read at a different date - which makes the reader/kudo rate kinder than it looks. 

but it's hard not internalizing stats bc i only know what i think of my work, and a writer's perspective is different from a reader's. we have different criteria, different needs, and i rely on other people to know if my writing is good or not. and even tho there's a lot of variables behind a sucky response rate, it's hard not to go from ""ooh this looks pretty good"" to ""well, it's okay ig,"" to ""it wasn't that great in the first place,"" and so on. 

posting fics is always sorta weird bc i do it for the validation - i write a thing and i want people to tell me it's good and cement the work as ""finished"" in my mind. if i was just doing it for the joy of writing, i wouldn't be sharing it all. but i'm starting to realize that i have a limited window for my ""validation high"" - after 1 to 2 weeks, i don't care anymore, i've already established how i feel abt the piece and i'm onto the next thing. kudos and comments (not counting really detailed or specific comments) won't really spark joy. it's just another thing in my in-box. 

tldr: it's not really about the amount of comments/kudos/hits i get but when i get them that matters. and i'm not sure how i feel about that."
512,t3_gc5uoj,FanFiction,How do you deal with a parallel story?,"Currently, I want to write a ""what-if scenario"" for my long fic and I need to get it out of my head before it makes a mess in my head, but I'm not sure how to deal with it properly. When I think of it, I feel like a shitty asshole because I made my OC develop his feelings to a canon but right now I want to write him doing the same thing with another canon character. It feels wrong but I don't know, I just want to write it down and post it as a new story.

Back to the question, I want to know how you do it, and I'm sorry if I say something wrong."
513,t3_gc364w,FanFiction,"Looking for some Mob/Yakuza fanfiction. Or if you know a tag for stories like that, let me know.","As the title says.

514,t3_gbexvk,FanFiction,Having a hater,"A week or so I made a post, and some anon decided to comment nasty, uncalled for things on it. They were banned, I forgot about them. Next day I woke up to my ao3 flooded by anonymous hate comments from this individual. Deleted the lot of it, didn't think more about it. Cue next day, same deal, I deleted, turned on comment moderation. This has happened every day this week now, I wake up, full inbox, it's from this person, commenting stuff like ""fans of \[my fandom\] are r\*tarded"", ""this is shit and boring"", ""lol never update this no one will read."" etc.

It pisses me off that I now have to disable anonymous commenting or show works only to registered users, just because of this person. It hurts to see new comments when you barely get any in the first place only to realize it's from this deranged troll who seems to have some huge issue with me and my fandom. I regret being too candid in one of my earlier posts and it leading to them picking up my ao3 user, and it's unwise to even post this, because they're on this reddit and they'll see they've successfully upset me. But I needed to, cause I'm tired and don't understand what they want to achieve with this. Fanfic is usually fun, but today I feel like not writing a single more word even though I planned on updating two of my fics this weekend, because this sucks. That's all.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit; thank you so much everyone who've commented, you really lifted me up, I appreciate with all my heart. I'll keep writing and hoping no one else has to go through this."
515,t3_gbyzyd,FanFiction,Celebrating milestones and reviewing overlooked fics,"I am one week away from the one-year anniversary of my long fic. 

In that one year I have written 93,673 words and have accumulated 519 kudos, 216 favorites, and a combined 575 subscribers/followers on AO3/FFN. I am so proud of what I have accomplished in this last year, and absolutely honored that out of all the millions of fanfics out there, people are enjoying *my* little story.

Tonight I posted the last chapter of book 2 of the fic, chapter 27. And in honor of that, I want to give back to this community, which has been such a great support to me in this. I know lots of people have been doing this lately, but it has been my intention to do a review post around the one-year mark for quite some time. Hopefully no one is tired of this yet. ;)

***I am trying to be realistic to what I can actually commit to doing, so I apologize that this is less expansive than many of these posts.*** Here are the rules:

If you have a fic that is **rated T or under** (or a very mild M) and that **has a low number of reviews** for your fandom/genre (I didn't want to put a firm number on this, but please be realistic - I'm trying to target stories that aren't getting enough love), post the link below. I will post one review for each of the **first 27 fics** (one for each of the 27 chapters I've posted of my fic) linked on this post. **Please let me know if you would like concrit**, and I can send that your way, too, in a private message."
516,t3_gbsaqb,FanFiction,Doing research for your story,"I've been recently researching a lot on Japanese schools for my story and I feel that took a lot of time out of me than doing the story, but it was a fun process.

It's not the only instance where I tried to research some stuff, I've also researched on how sleep deprivation affects the psych, subjects on Japanese folklore, how to take care of plants (my main character takes care of a small plant as a way to distract himself) and even researching on whether or not Japan gets certain games just to justify some references.

517,t3_gc4z47,FanFiction,Is it bad to start a new one?,"I'm at the final conflict of main fic-in-progress. The battle has begun. I can't do the battle justice right now because I keep wanting to impose freaking quarantine rules on these characters for this story that was conceived long before Covid-19 was a freaking issue! Before I spent six+ hours of my eight+ hour shifts forcing idiots to conform to social distancing. Before my biggest concern was, how am I going to get enough TP to not run out during *that time of the month*? Before I had a man scream at me about how I'm an awful, degenerate human being because my store (a convenience store, BTW) does not and never has sold eggs, bacon, or *Takis*. (I am really beginning to hate this snack on principle, I kid you not.)

Long story short: I'm not in the right mental place I need to be to do this fic justice. Is it wrong to just--side line into something different for a little while, or does that play with readers too much?"
518,t3_gby037,FanFiction,I don't think I can do better.,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm not much of a fanfiction writer, I've always been primarily a reader. However, a few years ago I got super into a small fandom and wrote a couple things, one of which being a 45k word parody fic. Since it's a small fandom I didn't get much in the way of interaction but I did get 30 reviews which were almost entirely positive, something that meant a lot to me since I figured everyone would hate what I was doing. 




Since then I've mostly taken a break on writing, due to being completely and utterly burnt out after writing that huge (to me) story, but lately there's this persistent itch to write. I've went back and looked at my fic and it honestly makes me cringe now because I can see all the flaws and places where my execution was less than perfect. Not to mention, there were also plot lines I started but dropped because I got unmotivated halfway through and said f it and I regret that. Seeing everything with ""new"" eyes honestly makes me want to start over and rewrite it and make it into more of what I wanted the original fic to be.



But I feel like I can't do any better than I did the first time. And some part of me is also afraid that I'll do worse and destroy what people liked about the original fic in the first place. So this fear has me frozen, paralyzed really, because I desperately don't want to screw up that fic for people, even though current me definitely isn't happy with how it turned out."

I understand if RPF is not your thing, but downvoting on every single kpop ff post on here is not going to change the fact that they exist

honestly, this is exhausting. many people just want to find each other to talk about writing certain bands, ships, dealing with events in kpop, etc, and we can't find each other since almost everyone downvotes everything relating to that.

they can't put it in the kpop tag because other people will hate it there, too, so there's really nowhere where kpop ff authors can talk freely

\*\*EDIT\*\* there is a subreddit, i was not informed. still, though, the hate and the downvoting on every single kpop post on the FF tag needs to stop

I'll find all that out if you just let me read it. You've ruined all the suspense your good writing would have built up!



SELF CRITICISM

* Sorry this isn't good!
* I'm not good at smut/angst/fluff!

Let me be the judge of how good it is or isn't. Don't do yourself down for crying out loud. That's the best way to lose  reader confidence even if it is actually great stuff!

* long drawn out excuses about why your update was late. 
Just post it when you can and we'll read it. I don't need to know about your dog vomiting.

Finally a controversial one: 

* Using the beginning/end notes as your blog. 

It interrupts the flow of the story. Maybe use comments for that level of chat."

526,t3_gc0f08,FanFiction,Concrit Commune - May 02,"Welcome to the Concrit Commune, where you can get bits of your fic looked at... for a small ""price.""

For the purposes of this thread, concrit is defined as - pointing out things that could use improvement *and also* giving suggestions on how to do so.  Compliments are always welcome, of course.

The rules:

* State your `Fandom | Title | Rating | Any Applicable Content Warnings | Link - AO3, FFN, etc.` at the top of the comment.
* Post a few paragraphs (copy and paste to a comment, please) of your fic, or your plot premise, or your character bio, or your world building, whatever you need help with.  
* There is a soft **limit of 500 words**.  [Not your whole fic.](https://i.imgur.com/NTb9Mwu.gif)
* Please post an outside link to underage and extreme-explicit violence/rape content.  Pastebin is simple and doesn't require an account.
* If you, the author, are looking for something specific - the phrasing of a particular part or if a character's reaction is believable - please ask!
* If you just want to hand out advice without throwing your own fic in, you're quite welcome to.
* **If you post part of your fic you must give concrit to someone else in the thread!**

---
Since we're all here to give and receive help from other people, a certain level of respect for the author and the work they've put into their fic is expected as a baseline courtesy and should be reciprocated.

Tearing into a fic or author without regard for their effort isn't constructive even if there is decent criticism attached.  Moreover, it discourages people from participating if they know that insults await them.

You aren't expected to treat this thread like the Comment Cooperative, advice and honesty and pointing out flaws is what we're here for.

Some helpful tips to keep things running smoothly:

* Keep your comments helpful to the author, not just smashing out your opinion.  
* Be polite and civil.  
* Be kind. At a minimum, showing your peers professional courtesy is expected.
* Phrases like ""I think"" or ""I believe"" can lighten your tone.  
* Elaborating on *why* you think something could be changed is not only more useful to the author but keeps statements from being abrupt."

529,t3_gbrhvz,FanFiction,Getting close to twenty thousand words.,"This is my first work, writing, exploring and enjoying the community. When I started writing, I was just new into the whole fanfiction thing. I never red anything related to fanfictions, maybe saw drawings or heard a friend talking about how creative people have to be to start their own fanfiction. I though: that can't be to hard, and so I started writing, and hey let's go a bit over the top and start writing in an other language and over a topic, at least I have not seen a thing of. That means for me, long nights, researching, waiting for a response and writing, editing and repeat.

I uploaded my first try and it was doing great. 70 views in two days. This is now  over a year past. Since then I was driven away from writing. Only because of the Corona crisis I was again pulled in, into the deep see which was my writing. A friend had just finished the game of thrones series and was eager to learn more about the lore and history. He was most fascinated by Valyria. The greatest city in the world. Destroyed by something unknown. And so I recommended him to read my fic. 

At first I wrote this piece of paper to get over the (insert insult of your liking) of the last season of GOT. I wanted to explain to myself, why things happend, how they happened. Of cause I couldn't figure out, how they teleported and such things, but maybe I could go into the psychic of the characters and develop something, why they acted like they did. And this is the start of how I started.

Going deep  into the lore of GOT, reading the books and watching the TV series again, yes every episode, till the last one, and i figured out, to know why this happend I had to explore the past.

Now I'm closing the 20 000 word mark and I am very happy to share it with you.

Thanks for a great last year of reading and writing :D"
530,t3_gbrz2o,FanFiction,The 'unofficial conventions' of a fandom...,"Some context: I've been wholly invested in a single fandom with my writing and most of my reading, but a bad conversation with another fan has made me realize that I may be getting fed up with some typical elements in that fandom. I decided that I should put the ideas that I have on other franchises out there too.

But this got me thinking... It seems that fandoms have a attachment to certain concepts that earlier fics or even art introduced. Should these be respected? For the sake of popularity, but also because it's something that is in the 'zeitgeist'?

If so, it would follow that people not only need to understand the canon, but also have an understanding of the most popular fics in the fandom?"
531,t3_gbofql,FanFiction,Writing too slowly,"When I started uploading my story in March (I even made a post about it back then and had some wonderful comments from people on this subreddit &lt;3) I had a schedule in mind of 1 chapter per week.

Since I'm unemployed and therefore have all the time in the world writing one chapter per week shouldn't be too hard right? Well I was wrong.

I have insomnia (self-diagnosed I've not seen a doctor since like 2012? but I'm 99% convinced it's insomnia), I have an incredibly difficult time falling asleep and when I fall asleep I often wake up within 2-4 hours (4hours of sleep is a ""good"" day) for example earlier today I finally fell asleep, and then I woke up after 5 minutes (not even kidding) and it took hours to fall asleep again and I slept less than 4 hours and I'm exhausted.

Anyway, it just means that I'm in this permanently tired  zombie-like state of mind and have great difficulty concentrating on things - I can still chat fine and writing a post like this isn't too hard either, but watching a movie is impossible and writing a fanfic means I can spend 10 hours on like 300 words. 

Back in 2015 I used to write 1000 words per hour and sometimes I could even pull of 2000 words per hour. It's not even a writer's block like I will have an idea of the scene or an outline to follow but thinking about the words just takes a really long time?

I found out that writing smut can still be easier than writing plot because it requires less thinking so there's the occasional outburst of me just writing filth. 

Now I'm two weeks behind my schedule and I'm not yet finished with my chapter I also don't want to break it down and release a part of it now, I know to what point in the story I want to get and I don't want to upload anything less than that. 

In the meantime I got inspiration for a really short one-shot smut thing that I was just going to dump on Twitter as it's so much easier to type away and I immediately got an anonymous comment asking if I could update my story on AO3 instead and I know they don't mean it in a negative way but like I just want to scream. 

Does anyone else write really slowly?

I know some people gave tips like write 5 sentences per hour but those don't really work for me either."
532,t3_gbh5c7,FanFiction,I want to thank you guys,"Hi, first post here I just want to thank you guys.

I ran into your sub two days ago and you gave me the motivation to post an OS.

I always liked to write. It’s not even my first fanfic, when I was younger I wrote some (probably horrible but I would be curious to read them now haha).

However, I stopped writing for several years. When I was 13, my French teacher (im french) enrolled me in a writing competition. She thought I was good and had my chances. I worked for two months on a short story.

After sending my story, I received a letter from the jury telling me that they loved my story and I was invited to a ceremony. I was really proud, just imagine the average student invited to a ceremony haha.

Of course my life sucks so when I got to that ceremony, the jury realized they invited the wrong person. They had no idea who I was ! I thinks its funny now but at the time, it really destroyed me. My French teacher was really angry, it created a big drama, actually.

This teacher was great and she said, ""Hey, you’re good, don’t give up. Keep writing,"" but I didn’t. I just couldn’t, you know?

Anyway, I’m 20 now and for the first time since all that, I started writing again. I never dared to post though, I’m freaking insecure.

After reading your sub all night, I decided to post a small OS. I woke up this morning and saw 4 reviews  asking me to keep writing.

So really guys, thank you. Without this sub, I wouldn’t have dared post my OS and yet I needed it. I need someone to tell me I’m not writing shit, it’s probably kinda ridiculous but I needed it."
533,t3_gbnac8,FanFiction,Vaguetweeting about fanfics,"Isn’t it funny how people will tweet about a fanfic, sometimes adding a screen cap of some of the fic itself, but they won’t include a link or even mention the title or the author?

I’ve come across tweets, either by accident or by someone directing me to them, where people talk about my fics. It’s always nice things, which is good, but it feels a bit like being talked about as if you aren’t there, or like when people repost art and don’t even bother to credit the artist. 

Sometimes it’s people who have their AO3 account in their twitter bio and they don’t even bother leaving kudos or a comment (okay, maybe it’s weird to check, but if someone is a known entity in the fandom, I’m gonna remember their name). It’s a compliment and maybe they’re shy, but it feels a bit like they’re trying to get clout for their reaction to the fic rather than appreciating the fic itself.

Ah well. There are worse problems to have. It just leaves me with mixed feelings. I’m flattered, but I’m also a little bummed. When I tweet about a fic, I link the fic and @ the author if they have their twitter in the fic or AO3 bio. I know no one is obligated to promote a fic, though. Once it’s out there, people will do what they want. Just the way it is.

I’m watching my sisters puppies right now. Gotta keep a constant eye on them or they destroy things in the yard. I HAVE to stay outside and watch them while my mom and dad are at work. (We have a huge yard, plenty of room for them to run and burn energy, and it’s better than being cooped up inside where there’s even more opportunities for them to chew things)

So, it begs the question: WHY do I only want to write when I physically can’t!? 😂

I want to preface this by saying that I *am not begging* nor do I expect anyone to give me *anything.* I'm dumb, but I'm not an entitled brat. This is just me venting about some feelings I have. Feelings that I'm aware can sound stupid, entitled and irrational, but I just wanted to get it out. 

To be very transparent, I'm jealous. Jealous of all the people whose fics are loved enough that they are gifted art. I didn't used to be before, but recently I've just been down on myself and my writing and especially my (soon-to-be-former) main ship. It was compounded when an artist I'm (or used to be now) friends with got involved in a new fandom and started posting about it all the time. 

Now, don't get me wrong. It is 100% OKAY for people to jump fandoms. Interests shift, things go on hiatus, etc... People are allowed to have different tastes and not be pigeon-holed into one fandom and I respect that. BUT, then they wrote a post asking people to send *fic recs* for this new fandom because they wanted to do art for them (for free) and when people did, they gushed and gushed about their fics and made this pretty art and I couldn't help but feel a little jealous of these authors. 

This artist, as far as I know, never made a similar request while in my fandom. And beyond commissions that I paid for (and have no qualms paying for. I like to support artists), neither them or any one else cared a lick about my fics and my ship and despite them being not terrible, no one ever asked to make art for me. Heck, I can't even get them to comment without begging and crying. 

It just makes me a little sad is all. And, as irrational as it is, makes me feel like my ideas and writing were never ""good enough"" for them or the fandom, even though I know and have been told that my writing is not terrible. Some of the ideas they had for these fics and this new ship are ones I had before too, but they stopped answering my DMs (I'm patient and I do not spam. I sent one or two messages over a few weeks), so I gave up asking for commissions and unfollowed them because I just got sick of looking at this new thing and watching them gush over all of these fics (which I'm sure aren't bad. I'm just not into the medium) when they never followed through on any of their promises to read mine in the past. 

Is it petty and stupid? Yes. Totally. I admit that. Which is why I keep it to myself. Because I know it's not my place to tell anyone what to do or what they should like. If this makes them happy, they can go for it. I'm glad they found something they love so much. And yet, I still can't help being sad and jealous about the whole thing and wishing that they had cared enough about my content when we were friends. 

Thank You for listening."

545,t3_gbpypm,FanFiction,What should I know before beginning?,"Hi!

Variations of this question were probably asked one hundred times, but I hope mine isn't too redundant.

A few months ago, my country knew a intense period of strikes, especially in the transports. I agreed with the strikers, but that didn't protect me of long waits in train stations or under bus shelters. Then an idea begun to hatch, a story for a Pokémon ROM hack. I loved this idea, and wrote things with my frosted hands. The strike finished (unfortunately without a victory), and I stopped writing. The idea, however, never left me, and I continued to think about it from time to time. Because of the confinement, I decided to try something else and, instead of creating a game, I begun to write a little novel.

You're probably asking yourself now: “why is he saying all that? We are not in r/PokemonROMhacks ! And even if we were, what's the link with the question?”. I can assure you that I didnt wrote that because I love to speak about me, even if my life is exciting to follow (spoiler alert: no it's not). No my point was: **I'm now writing a fanfiction, but I never have read one in my life**! So I'm asking for advices as a total and gigantic noob, not only as a writer, but as a reader too. I discovered fanfictions because I was writing one...

Obviously the first advice (and I begun to follow it) would be to read fanfictions. English is not my first language (you probably already understood that reading me), so the second would be to find a beta reader. I'll try when I'll have something more consistent to show.

But I'm sure that's not enough. Which advices would you provide to someone in my situation? Is there a “The world of fanfictions 101” somewhere to read?

Thank you!"
546,t3_gbip6s,FanFiction,How many bookmarks do you have of stories you've liked? (Not on your own work) Do you remove a bookmark once a WIP is complete?,"I've noticed huge variations.(I use mostly AO3)

One 'big name' author has only about 10 bookmarks on their profile. I guess only the 'crème de la crème' get bookmarked by them. 

Others have over 1000.

For me, unless it had a big impact on me once the final chapter is posted I'll remove my bookmark.

I have 140 bookmarks. They are stories I would read again or had an impact on me.

There was one good author who had about 80 proper bangers so after that if there's a prolific and excellent author I would bookmark just one story with the note 'everything by the author is worth a re-read - great historical accuracy' or something like that. Usually they will be works with lots of bookmarks already so I don't feel like that's 'depriving' an author of a bookmark on each work."

554,t3_gbbbzw,FanFiction,A disagreement with the “Please write a summary that is actually a summary” post!,"The original post is [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/fx5ts0/please_please_please_write_a_summary_that_is/)

First of all, I definitely agree that people need to write actual summaries instead of just saying “I’m bad at summaries, read the fic”. BUT, I definitely disagree with your definition of a “bad summary”.

Plenty of beautiful fics have short summaries that are just one or two lines of dialogue - for example, one of my favorite stories *ever* is [Misethere](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9168430?view_adult=true) by Astolat. The summary goes:

&gt; Emhyr was looking at him for once, with a strange expression. “I have misjudged you,” he said, sounding irritated actually: how dare Geralt surprise him.

&gt;“I get that a lot,” Geralt said.

Without needing a slightly cheesy summary like “Emperor Emhyr gets cursed with a love spell! Will he and Geralt ever cure it with Yennefer’s help? Will their relationship stay true?” 

Or something like that, we get a beautiful, short, and subtle summary that not only intrigues the reader, but also shows the dynamics at play: we can see that Emhyr is a man that hardly ever guesses wrong, and is in a position to be confident in that skill, while Geralt is a man that often subverts expectations in a casual way. We are able to see the personalities of the characters in those two short sentences without the need for an overly long and unnecessary rhetorical question.

 I actually prefer fics with those kinds of summaries, because the characterization and writing is usually so much more developed, as well as just more fun to read. (Maybe that’s just on AO3.) There are plenty of question-style summaries that are really good, but I dislike how the original OP makes it black-and-white: quote summaries are bad, while question summaries are automatically good - because a lot of times they’re not.

Very sorry if this comes off as rude. I just wanted to make a case against that post."

557,t3_gbq4pi,FanFiction,Huge spoilers were released into my fandom. What do I do? (Does not contain actual spoilers),"Throwaway account, due to the excessive targeting trolls have been doing to users that are in the fandom.

I won't say what fandom it is exactly, just in case, but it's for a long-anticipated upcoming season/sequel. The fandom itself is a decent size, but the fanfiction community is pretty small, less than 3000 fics in total for the past five years. Earlier this month, massive spoilers were leaked and trolls have been aggressively targeting fans all over Reddit, Twitter, Insta, etc. It's similar to when Avengers: End Game released and people were DMing each other with misleading names, topics, etc. just to reveal the spoiler. It's truly a stain on what is going to be a remarkable piece of art.

I haven't been spoiled yet, and I've been really conscious about staying away from places where that could happen. I've even installed a browser plug-in that censors keywords that could reveal this information.

I guess what I am trying to figure out is - has anyone experienced something like this before? I want to keep posting and writing my WIP, but I worry that someone terrible might barge into the comments. I poked around on AO3 last night and it didn't look like anything malicious was happening. The season/sequel doesn't release until later this year, but I don't want to take a hiatus and disappoint my readers since I have been posting chapters consistently. I don't want to live in fear, and I want to support other writers in my fandom and community.

Any advice?"

560,t3_gbeykp,FanFiction,Longfic WIP fatigue,"I've been working on a longfic since January. It is a sequel to a one-shot I loved so much I decided to turn into a 'verse. Originally I wanted to have it finished by April. Now I don't know if I'm going to have it done by the end of the summer. I keep coming up with new ideas and adding to the story. It doesn't help that I'm burnt out. I've been writing it exclusively for months now and the past few weeks I've been focusing on shorter works to take a break. 

Now I'm struggling to get back into the WIP. I'm so invested in this story, it's all I think about before bed (I'm the type of person who must imagine stories to fall asleep). I've put so much time, effort, and thought into it. I can easily envision where it will go, and there's so many scenes I want to write. But my endurance is waning. I know the end product is going to be great, at least in my opinion, but I can't muster the energy to see it through. It isn't a lack of motivation--I really want to do this!! Which makes my fatigue even more frustrating, thus worsening my block. I don't have much experience with longfics and this is probably the most ambitious project I've started in my career as a fic author. I know there isn't a time limit, per say, but I fear the longer I struggle with this the harder it will be to overcome. So... any tips?"

I'm reading a book call  ***""The Only Grammar Book You'll Ever Need: A One-Stop Source for Every Writing Assignment""***  but need more about the basic of writing stories like the use of ""said"" I get so much feed back about the way I used said is not right I think, and other Story grammars."
563,t3_gbfgtg,FanFiction,I Learned A Thing,"And it might explain why I write more fanfiction than original works. (And it also explains why my beta reader/editor/official artist is officially the best person on the planet for me to work with \[she's also my girlfriend\])

What I about learned today is a thing called [Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia). What it is, is the lack of ability to visualize things in your head.

I was curious when I saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewsGmhAjjjI) about it pop up in my youtube feed cause I'd never heard of it before, and after watching the video I realized that my extreme difficulty visualizing thoughts in my head (I don't have a complete lack of visuals, but I can't visualize anything I haven't seen before, I can pull up memories of things I've seen before and put them in place of whatever I need, but the visuals I get from that are often vague and slightly off in some way either lacking detailed colors or hazy or blurry in some way) isn't normal. I'd never thought about it before, cause I'd just assumed most people are like that.

And when I started thinking about that, I started to realize that it explained a lot about my writing. In my writing I don't tend to use a lot of set pieces or give a lot of detail about much of anything. I can say what should be there in the scene, and what should be happening, but I can't actually see it in my head. I think that's part why I ended up turning to fanfiction for most of my writing, to hone my skills and all that, because in fanfiction *especially* fanfiction set within the canon world (even if it's an alternate story line or canon divergent) I don't need to describe things much as most of my readers already know about the place the story is set, they know what it looks like if I just say the characters are in \[a specific location from the game\]. My beta/GF on the other hand, she's the exact opposite, she can visualize just about *anything* in her head (so much so that I've asked her multiple times to design things for me and draw them out because I *can't* see them but I *do* know what they shouldn't look like to be able to tell her what to change until I can point to the thing and go ""that's the thing!"")

I just thought this was all really neat. I'm curious now about other writers here. How many of you have trouble visualizing things in your head? If you do have that trouble, is it part of why you write fanfiction instead of more original works?

EDIT: I'm also curious from a reader's point of view. If you do have this trouble, does it have any relevance to whether or not you prefer fanfiction to original fiction/novels?

567,t3_gbasl7,FanFiction,When Fanfiction is Better,"So, in this fandom that I've in, in one of the recent cinematic reboots they changed this one character to a different character. I hated the new character. I was browsing the fandom and she seems to be a fandom favorite. And when I read this character in fanfiction, I love her. She's smart, cynical, and funny. I thought; I must be wrong about this character. I went and watched the movie again and--nope. I still can't stand this character. Her fanfiction portrayals are much better to me and I can't watch her on the screen without thinking violent thoughts. So, the fanfiction is better, and I'm avoiding movies where that character seems to have a lot of screen time, which kind of saddens me. See, I like the other characters just fine. Their new interpretations are pretty fun to watch--but that one just. I don't know.  I can't stand her. And at the same time, when I come across her in the fandom stories, she's done really well. I think the writers knew what kind of character they wanted, but didn't know how to make her work. I sincerely hope that if they make another movie with this character that one of the writers sees how the fandom is portraying this character and makes some changes because that, in my opinion, is the only way to salvage this character. Thanks for reading my vent."

I want to finish what I started for my (late) shipping week fic, and even if I didn't, I told my audience on tumblr that I'd be doing this and I want to go through with my words.

That being said, I'm having a lot of difficulty being motivated to get it done. Probably a mix between exhaustion and being stuck a lot. Like, seriously, school has left me drained and exhausted. I would use a co-writer or editor, but I don't have friends who could help me.

Like, this is taking forever. Last time I participated in a shipping week, it took three days to write (granted, I only wrote for one day, but still). I wish I could write faster.

It kind of just sat untouched after a few weeks of struggling to write, deleting, struggling to write, deleting, and repeating ad nauseum. 

I sat myself down yesterday and decided that I was going to finish the chapter. I’ve been getting messages and comments from readers wondering about an update and those honestly gave me more motivation than anything else. Today is an important date in the game that my fic is based on, so I figured as a shout out to the date, I’d publish the new chapter finally. And I did! I was up until 4:30 this morning working and I wrote the entire day today up until half an hour ago when I finished, and it’s finally out there! 

What’s better is I’m actually proud of it again, and I figured out some serious story kinks that were holding me back while I worked on this chapter, so I now have a much clearer idea of where I’m going. So hopefully now it’ll be a bit easier to work down the line. 

But yeah!! I’m just excited to finally be at chapter 10 (48,215 words)!! Thanks for reading!"

Something unique that can easily be missed... (in my au, one of the soulmates doesn’t realize the other is their soulmate right away, so it has to be something that isn’t extremely obvious in the first meeting.)

I know reddit is perfect for all things unique ideas, so please hit me with your best shot!

EDIT: in my specific au, soulmate a realizes right away that they are soulmates, and soulmate b does not. this is part of the plot. so the idea would have to be obvious enough for one soulmate to realize, but easy to miss for the other to pass it by completely at their first meeting. thanks again!"

So, from the title, I wanna ask if you know any fanfiction that has a transmigrator (the oc or reader) that knows the storyline (they can decide how they'll deal with it) or even a reincarnator as long as the character was an outsider from the story... (preferably the cannon ships aren't disregarded)

I was hooked by this one naruto fanfic where the oc watched the anime then knew what will happen so she tried to save those who was suppose to die yadda yadda. Another was a Dr. Stone fanfic which is cute. I still have no actual comment since the story was still being built. There was this The Promise Neverland(??) which is another great fanfic but was yet to update...

If one knows a fanfic like this for bnha... that would be awesome~!

583,t3_gb8sl1,FanFiction,AO3 vs. FF reading preferences,"So, this might be just me, but despite the fact that both sites are used for the exact same thing, to me, they’re wildly different.

For example, I feel like FF is more lighthearted, more PG rated, and I think the sense of community is stronger/more consistent. i.e. it’s more common to see a core base of readers for your story that routinely review the work.

On the other hand, AO3 feels a little bit more distant, at the same time I feel like people review more but favorite/bookmark less when my experience in FF is the opposite. In AO3 very few readers comment consistently, but then appear in like chapter 15.

Also, am I the only one who thinks that you sometimes get more “serious” or “grownup” or “dark” works in AO3? Don’t get me wrong, I’ve read kickass fisc in FF, but I also feel like the general quality of AO3 (at least in the fandoms I follow) tends to be that little bit higher.

I have 2 main stories, a HP darkfic WIP (7k) and a generally lighthearted One Piece AU that’s branching out but the main story (57k) is done. They’ve been posted at roughly the same time on both pages and the difference in their performance is staggering.

On AO3 - 2 weeks posting time 
- HP has 18 comments, 257 kudos and 81 bookmarks at 4 chapters, and 3k hits.
- OP has 89 comments, 94 kudos and 30 bookmarks at 18 chapters and 1300 hits.

ON FFnet - 1 month posting time
- HP has 8 reviews and 60 favorites at 4 chapters and 3k views. 
- OP has 218 reviews and 232 favorites at 36 chapters with almost 50k views.

I’m sorry this is so long, the thoughts just wouldn’t leave me alone. Does anybody agree/disagree?
Has had like a widely different experience?
Has any theories about why the communities behave like this?

In my infinite wisdom, my full fucking intelligence, I hadn’t pasted the entire ending. There was a significant chunk that had not wound up in the clipboard when I had pasted it. And because it didn’t contain any obvious errors, none of my readers were any the wiser. Christ almighty, my entire AO3 readerbase got an unfinished ending. Fuck my life.

But... literally STRAIGHT after that (completely incidentally), my enthusiasm for the fic vanished. I honestly hated the next chapter I was working on and it was a complete anxiety-inducing slog to work on.

My enthusiasm has not been with this fic very much ever since (minus the epilogue which was a joy to write, but how to get there? Ugh.) 

I hope they can't tell, but I bet they can.

I don't want to give up the fic (or even go on break) because I'm SO close to the finish line. I'll feel so happy and accomplished when it's over and I won't disappoint the handful of consistent readers I have if I just get it done.

593,t3_gb11m8,FanFiction,Where does FF.net draw the line?,"As I write smut which is almost exclusively Explicit, I've been publishing all my stories on Ao3, largely as I've seen people talk about how their account has been deleted from [FF.net](https://FF.net) for breaking their policy on no MA rated fics.

Recently though, I've started using FF to publish extracts and abridged versions of my stories, if for no other reason that to get them out there to as wide an audience as possible, and see if I get any different responses. I also figured if I'm gonna cut them down, then I might as well make them T rated to see if that gets more readers.

Today I've just written and published a fic which I would consider to be Mature rather than Explicit. It uses words like cock and pussy a few times, and obviously talks about the sexual acts that are happening, but the descriptions of what's going on are a lot less graphic than my other stories.

I wondered if I'd be able to post this one on FF without cutting it down (or suffering the consequences) at all?

595,t3_gb58y3,FanFiction,Epilogue - How to tie up all the plot threads?,"Hi, I hope this isn't *too* specific of a question to ask. I'm one chapter away from finishing my first multi-chaptered fic. For the final chapter, I was planning to write an epilogue, and I thought it'd be fairly straightforward. I had a pretty clear idea on what tone/POV/plot point I wanted to end on. But...it really wasn't. At this point I don't know whether I'm facing creative burnout or just general issues with writing an ending?

To start off, the previous chapter was very dark and ended at a very intense point. (A character has to make a hard decision, and it's vaguely implied they choose the option that better serves the story's villain). There are events that happen between this chapter and the epilogue. At the time period of the epilogue, everything appears ""normal"", at least to the POV character, who wasn't affected or involved in the events of the story. But it should be clear to the reader that the characters who *were* affected are now scarred.

There were multiple characters affected by the events of this story, and I wanted to briefly touch on each of them within the epilogue. But one of the main issues that cropped up is just...length. I haven't even finished writing it, and it's already longer than any of my previous chapters. And I feel like an epilogue shouldn't really ramble for *that* long. But I don't know how else to have the POV character organically observe/interact with each of the affected characters.

Should I just let my epilogue be double the length of previous chapters (like 8-10k)? Should I scrap this idea and think up a new epilogue that only focuses on the main character? Is there any general advice people have about tying up the loose ends of a multichaptered fic?

I feel so close to the end, but I'm constantly doubting my ideas, and I think maybe just taking a break from this story might help, but at the same time posting an epilogue like...a year later would be weird."
596,t3_gb39o0,FanFiction,What's your thought on writers projecting themselves onto a character?,"Before I come with my opining I'm gonna make it very clear that a lot of the fanfiction where writers to  projecting themselves onto a character is really good, it's just different and not always what your looking for when looking up a character.

Alright so, by  projecting  themselves onto a character I don't mean as in using their own experience to write from, I love when people do that (or use research), makes the fic a lot better and reality like.I mean as in, writers that almost write themselves as being the main character and  projecting  their own traits onto the character forgetting about the characters own traits.

Like, look at the MCU spider-man. He's know to be smart, get good grades. In most fanfic he is super cuddly, has sensory overloads, are freaking stubborn, get's hurt a lot of is saved by his mentor iron man, and those two have a weird dad/son relationship. Right.But when a writer  projecting  themselves onto a character that can both give good things, like the older more mature collage Peter, but sadly... I sometimes jump into a fanfiction and get the feeling that the main character isn't really themselves, or act a lot younger than they usually would.

""Exactly like you said it. projecting traits is not the issue, its ignoring the characters original traits. if not, you are creating a completely new character that has the physical appearance of a known character"" - Friend of mine that I discussed it with.

I hope that made just a little sense. I'd like to hear your opinion on the topic."

I may also edit those posts in the future if I have any other questions.

I’ve read some lore or rather I listened to lore of Destiny and Destiny 2 from Youtuber “My Name is Bfy” (awesome guy who does great work regarding Destiny Lore and many other things) and I remember him reading a lore tab about how Warlord Shaxx was able to break through a concrete wall during the Battle of Six Fronts or something like that, so that narrows it down a bit but not enough. Which is why I am asking, how strong are guardians physically? Like can they move tanks with ease or are they slightly weaker than that, or does it depend on the Guardian in question and their light level? 

Obviously, Titans are the most powerful in terms of physical strength given their role the Destiny Game but specifics/comparisons like “a Titan is strong enough to lift and throw a bus”, or “A Warlock is able to summon lightning like Thor was able to do in that scene in Thor Ragnarok where he summons a massive lightning bolt”, or “Hunters can draw their weapons faster than the human eye can see”; things like that. I just want to be certain I am accurately displaying my main character to Destiny lore when I do start the story.

Question 2: In lore, are Guardians bound to one single class or are they able to switch between classes of Solar, Arc, and Void; and can they access them more readily than what is shown in the game?

Question 3: (This is more of a comparison and there might be a little bias since I am asking this on the Destiny Subreddit, but please try to be unbiased in your answers) Is the Hive more powerful/dangerous than the Reapers from Mass Effect?

Question 4: Are there reasonable grounds for Oryx to return or is he permanently dead/defeated because I remember a video that Byf did that explored the possibility of Oryx being alive and being able to return in someway.

Question 5: In Destiny, there is a term, Paracasual, and to my understanding, it means that a being has the power to break the normal laws of physics because their power or the limits to their power exist on a higher plane of the universe. Does this mean that Oryx and the Darkness are literally able to do anything/break every law of physics/existence in our plane of existence or are there still some restrictions that apply?

Question 6: Would it be appropriate to display certain/specific weapons like the Whisper of the Worm or other such weapons as more powerful/devastating given their origins then what is shown in the games?

*Edit*

Question 7: Would it be better to start the story during the events of Mass Effect 1 or Mass Effect 2? This is important because the Hive will play a role in this story and will be brought to bare against the Reapers as mentioned in a previous question."
598,t3_gaxs6f,FanFiction,Do you care about your author persona?,"I know many writers are present on other fandom platforms or social media. How much of a connection do you share between everything? Are most of your accounts connected (either linked or easy to find by username)? Do you keep most of your personality in fic notes, comment replies, etc.?

I made a new username a while back that's only been associated with fic work. I've always admired the friendly, composed authors, so I tried to emulate that. But I'm wondering if I should relax a bit..."
599,t3_gb3l8q,FanFiction,How open are you with reading/writing fics?,"Since fanfiction generally has a \*bad\* reputation (I'm sorry, it's true) how open are you with friends and family about your hobbies? Have you told anyone, and if so, how supportive were they of it?

I know I'm being dramatic about this lol, but I was just curious. I am an author and a reader and only one member of my family knows, (my brother) and pretty much forgot about it straight away. We don't talk about it.

Only the people closest to me in my friend group know that I read and write fanfiction, and then only one person has read my fic, and continues to read it. It's not that I don't trust those that don't know and are close to me, it's that it's just difficult to explain.

I'll be honest - I only got into fanfiction around the New Year, and before that believed it to be pure smut. I was wrong. Fanfiction is, well, it's great. I have always been a Harry Potter fan, and it took me too long to investigate into the world of fanfiction. I really enjoyed reading all different types of stories about the characters I love, and never imagined that I would be releasing my own fic and actually have some good responses to it.

My fic is more on the dark side of things, and not so family-friendly, so I kind of know that I could never be open about it. But sometimes it's hard not to talk about the thing you think about all day long and write thousands of words about. 

How is it for you?"
600,t3_gb7j0x,FanFiction,Branching out,"Hello, I'm an author of fanfiction involving ships between K-pop bands. I've been writing for about two months now, and because I'm writing about ships involving Korean bands, I've been posting my fanfiction on asianfanfics.com because I'm just writing for fun and it's relevant.

However, recently I've been interested in posting my fanfiction on other platforms. I've attempted to post one on AO3, but it didn't receive much attention. It may have just been because I'm not that great in tagging, or I was just starting out, or maybe my ship wasn't exactly popular.

I'm considering uploading my other fanfiction on AO3, so I was wondering if anyone here knows how popular K-pop is on that platform.

Alternatively, I'm also interested in posting my fanction on other plaforms, but I've just started out and I'm not aware of popular sites, and would appreciate it if you could help me discover and learn.

Thank you for your help."

What's a nice way to tell someone no, I'm not ever going to continue?"
602,t3_gb8phn,FanFiction,Looking for an InuYasha fic,"So....I literally joined Reddit specifically in an effort to find this fic. I neeeeeed it. (I saw a couple of other posts like this, so I don't think it violates any rules???)

It was originally posted on y!gallery, and had 40+ chapters as best I can remember. I know y!gallery imploded, but I'm hoping someone knows if it was cross-posted to another site or happened to save the text.

It was an InuYasha/Sesshomaru fic where they sort of accidentally became mates. Because of this new bond, Sesshomaru witnesses most of InuYasha's memories and realizes his brother has really gotten the shaft in life (from Sesshomaru himself and others).

So Sesshomaru resolves to be a better person to his brother and drags InuYasha to the castle and tries to make him feel at home, but all it does is make Inu mad most of the time.

InuYasha keeps having serious health problems (I believe it was because his human half was very unhappy with chugging along for 200 years while at the same time his demon half was finally trying to mature). The last I remember reading, InuYasha had just become more demonic because his human half couldn't hold out anymore.

I do remember the art for the story had marks of a sun on one and moons on the other 🤔"
603,t3_gaxlhg,FanFiction,Be careful with using e-mail apps for writing on mobile,"I’m kicking myself pretty hard atm because yesterday, after over a week of hardly being able to write anything at all, I finally got the spark again and spent a few hours for writing between a couple different story ideas. Originally, I’d been doing this in the Notes app on my phone as I’m not physically able to sit up at my computer and type for the time being so I figured using my phone was the next best thing if I’m going to be in bed for most of the day, but yesterday, I decided to try writing via my primary e-mail app instead. My plan was to put myself as the recipient in the “To” section, write in the empty field, keep it saved as a draft, finally send it when I was all done and then copy and paste everything into the Microsoft Word document on my PC containing the rest of the story. In theory, I liked this idea better because it felt a little more comfortable for me using that app as opposed to the Notes because of the design and even more than that, I no longer had to copy and paste what I typed in Notes to the e-mail which I would then have to paste to Word after I received it, so it was just one less step for me to go through.

In practice however, that wasn’t what happened. Instead, when I woke up this morning and eagerly checked my drafts to work on them some more, I was shocked to discover that one of them no longer had anything in the whole text field except for “(null).” I refreshed the app and even tried to edit the draft when I reopened it just to see if it was a glitch and unfortunately, it wasn’t. I searched online to see if others have had this same problem and strangely was unable to find any answers or even questions about it. What made me feel even worse was that that was the draft I’d spent the overwhelming majority of my time on yesterday, at least a couple hundred words and probably a few hours’ worth of time iirc, and now it’s inexplicably all gone for absolutely no discernible reason whatsoever. I know for a FACT that I saved and double-checked it before I went to bed last night, but it doesn’t matter now because  at this point, there’s nothing I can do except try to remember what I wrote and start from scratch again from Notes this time around so I’m cutting my losses and moving on.

In short, while the e-mail draft method may work perfectly fine for you without any problems at all, be aware that this particular issue is out there and can wipe out an entire story you have saved completely out of nowhere at any given time. This is the first and last time I ever use something that relies on an Internet connection for writing as I no longer trust any of it unless I can fully access it offline after what just happened today."
604,t3_gbddhj,FanFiction,Details in stories discussion.,"I'm currently working on a fic that uses tarot card reading as a foreshadowing technique, I go over the details of the card and what it means for the character(s), then the character(s) move on without giving it any more thought.

For sake of time and what seems like excessive descriptions I chose the 3 - 1 card method meaning only 3 cards are read versus 10. 

Either way I thought this was a really neat way to foreshadow and engage the readers a bit; but now that I'm almost done writing the reading scene, I am starting to second guess myself.

I've set the scene up like a general card reading, with minimal reading details: just the cards being pulled, reversed or upright, and then the reading. 

But as a reader, I'm also starting to think of it as a tedious detail.... any thoughts or suggestions?"
605,t3_gb0b93,FanFiction,How do I avoid long sentences?,"It's basically what the title says.
Whenever I'm writing, I find myself writing sentences that are often too long or sometimes too short. Maybe I'm just imagining it, but I do sometimes think it makes reading my stories much harder. 

Do you guys have any tips for that?

Edit:

A fellow redditor recommended adding a few examples, so here are two:

""A cocktail of emotions he definitely didn't like and a poisonous cocktail which made his stomach feel like a hole...an empty, black hole, consuming everything which made the Brit feel a bit better.""

""Without the city displayed right in front of the man, the cocktail of emotions would have spilled, maybe causing a panic attack, which in his current state of mind wouldn't help him at all.""

These are from the same work, I kinda like them but i'm afraid they're too long :/"
606,t3_gavhn6,FanFiction,Tips for Anybody Interested in RPF,"RPF (real person fiction) is an already an ethically murky ground, so I thought I'd make a post for anybody interested in RPF or anybody considering joining a real person fandom. I'm a part of multiple fandoms, and for the past few months, one of them has been a real-person fandom, so I believe I'm fairly qualified, and hopefully, I can help someone out there with these tips and opinions.

1. **Set boundaries.** Now, this is VERY, VERY important. Never forget you're writing about a real person, not a fictional character. Especially if you're writing anything with romance or smut, remember that what you're writing is not real. Those people you're shipping in your fic are not necessarily together. Don't ship them in real life or delude yourself into believing they're actually  in love IRL. *You have your boundaries as a fan*, and you might already be crossing them if you're writing or reading RPF. Don't go any further. Another thing I think all RPF fandoms should follow is not interfering in the person's real life. Don't write about people in the person's personal life. For example, if you're writing for BTS, don't include the group member's real-life parents- their parents are not in the public eye and it might come off as especially creepy.
2. **Set boundaries for yourself.** *Especially* when it comes to RPF (and this also applies to other fandoms), it's totally okay if you're uncomfortable with certain things as a reader or a writer. Personally, I have a rule for myself: I don't write smut for RPF. And if it is in a fic, I tend to skim over it. Nothing against smut, it's just personally something I'm not very comfortable with in (my own) RPF. For you, these boundaries might be different- it might be you don't like ships at all, or that you don't want a person written a certain way, or you only read AUs. Don't feel pressured into doing things a certain way.
3. **Be careful when venturing into the fandom.** This might sound a little paranoid... but please don't go into parts of the fandom that you find creepy. There are really people out there who believe the members of their favourite band are \~in luv\~ and hiding it from the public. There are really stalkers out there. There are really people who do all sorts of ridiculous things in the name of their idol. Some fandoms are extremely toxic. In my experience, though, the people who make the 'Why X and Y are really dating' analysis videos are not usually the people who write fic.
4. **Consider disclaimers.** By this, I mean consider putting a disclaimer at the beginning of your fic. I don't think most do this, but I personally find it comforting as a reader to know that the writer of the fic I'm reading is not delulu, and as a writer, it just puts my nerves at ease. To give you an idea: usually my disclaimers involve explaining that this fic is not reality, I don't ship any people in real life, and the characters in my fic only borrow certain aspects of real people.
5. **DO NOT SHOVE YOUR FIC OR FANDOM IN THE PERSON'S FACE.** This is one of the MOST important tips I have. Don't tag or send your fic to the person you've written it about. Just don't. I believe most K-Pop fandoms (I'm not sure about others) have a really strong culture of hiding fic away from idols, and I am 100% in support of this. Most people are already aware of RPF, so don't fucking show it to them or mention it to them, if you ever do meet them. I *cannot emphasize this enough.*

That's all the tips I have for now, and if I think of any I'll be sure to add them. What about you guys? Do you have any tips or boundaries you set?"

I've tried rewriting it probably 5 times already, and taken days (and days and days) away from it to refresh... But it's just not flowing.

I'm wondering if maybe 1) it's just challenging because the emotional content is kinda personal to me, or 2) it's the chemistry between characters that's making it uncomfortable (my MC and the ex-wife who cheated on him, then let him wreck his career to cover up the affair for the sake of their daughter).

Maybe it's *supposed* to be uncomfortable? (Life isn't always neat and tidy, after all.)

I wanted to ask around and see some other opinions. Is there such thing as too long a one-shot? Too short? Personally, as a reader, I avoid reading drabbles and go for one-shots of around 5-10k words, but I'm usually more concerned with tags and summary. How about you? Would a long, single chapter turn you off?"

619,t3_gaaib3,FanFiction,Fanfiction saved my building,"I read a lot of fanfiction. Since I was twelve, I’ve stayed awake many nights until three in the morning glued to a screen just because I couldn’t wait to know what happened next in a story, or because, like a junkie, I was browsing for one that would fix my emotional needs at the time. It is how I cope with life. It has messed up my sleep schedule to this date, and some of my grades in high school. 

It payed off. First of all, I want to thank everyone who ever has published anything, because this could have happened anywhere and anytime and to anyone. This time it just happened to me, that day.

I was reading late into the night, like so many others. I was stressed, like so many of us during this weird period - we are living in interesting times. Chapter by chapter, it went by, and the hands in the clock went forward. It was 2 am and was forgetting how to process words. I put my phone down, and went to the bathroom to take my contacts off, they were pretty much glued to my eyes by that point. 

It smelled of incense, or at least it smelled like that to my sleep addled nose. Like a church during Easter mass. But I was not in a church. I was a bathroom. I smelled the smoke, opened the window, and almost got my head stuck in the window grating for my troubles, trying to see where it was coming from. 

There was a fire in my building. It had started almost 10 floors down, in an area that is not visible from many angles, not from the street, not from the condominium, and according to the firefighters, not even from floor level on the side where it was. 

I was the one who gave the alarm. The fire was outside, it didn’t trigger the building’s fire alarm. It was in a low visibility zone, even I had difficulty seeing it, no one would have noticed it from the street. Even if people were home, who would have noticed? It was bloody 2 am. 

I noticed. Because I had been reading fanfiction, I was awake to notice, give the alarm. 

I had my father call the firefighters, we live close to their headquarters, it is just one street over, and no one needed to be evacuated. I was caught early, before it did much damage. It was a happy ending. 

There are 144 apartments in the building where I live. It still haunts me what would have happened if I wasn’t reading fanfics at night. I have not been sleeping well since. Still don’t. 

But still. Fanfic has given a lot of us happy endings for stories we didn’t want to end on a bad note. That night, it gave a happy ending to this part of my life. I am grateful to all the authors who have given us these stories, and I want them to know they may have a greater impact on people’s lives than they might think. 

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart ❤️"
620,t3_gaq03o,FanFiction,COVID-19 Fanfiction Crash,"It appears as if the COVID-19 lockdowns all over the world might increase fanfic activity, and for a while, it appears that it did. Writers have more time to write and readers have more time to read.

But I'm starting to see something different. As the lockdowns wore on, it appears that this boost to fanfic is leveling out. With more fanfic being created and updated, there's more competition, and this cancels out the higher number of readers and the higher amount of time they're putting in. You might even get pushed down the list so fast that most readers would just go to the top 3 or top 5 most recently updated stories - it basically becomes a game of 'fastest finger first' (note: this term is the name of a mini-game from Who Wants To Be A Millionaire). The 'rich-poor readership gap' might have grown during COVID-19.

But then there's the extended isolation. I can feel it. It's wearing me down, and it's harder to write. The lockdown gave me something like a boost of 50% to my writing speed. I used to write 25k words a month, and now it's like 38k words in April. But I don't know how long it'd last. It doesn't help that I have real-life issues to worry about. Career and finances, for instance. Would readers grow tired of reading? I can imagine that they might, for all the same reasons and more.

In short, personally, I feel like I've hit the wall. I fear I might write less and I fear the quality of my writing has dropped, and fewer people appear to be reading my work and/or engaging with me  (ie review and comments, etc) despite having written much faster. It's discouraging, and though I try not to let external factors affect me, I'm afraid that it might.

Are you guys observing the same things?"
621,t3_gb0uqh,FanFiction,Running Commentary,"~~for someone who doesn't post a lot in most places/things I certainly have been posting a lot here imo~~

This is just something I started to do today, but I think it's going to help me in the long run so I wanted to share the idea here for anyone else who tends to have problems keeping track of things they're trying to foreshadow or things they're referencing or just little trivia bits (you can put just about anything u decide to tbh) while writing. 

I was sharing a chapter with my beta/editor this morning, and while we were discussing the grammar and how I could word things better, I started realizing there were some things I knew that she didn't because she's not inside my head for the writing and the story itself is in a super limited point of view and neither of us wanted her to change things that were written oddly intentionally because of the character's voice. So I started leaving her comments (on the google doc we're working in) about things I was thinking of changing and places where I wasn't sure if a better wording would help. 

And then I started leaving her little notes about the lore, the backstory, and other little things like the thoughts of a character that isn't the POV character for the scene but are still important for the story later on because it'll come up later. I thought it would be helpful because she's never played the games I'm writing for, all she knows is the stuff she's learned from listening to me for the last four years. She loved them! 

So I started adding even more and now I have like this really interesting running commentary on the side of my google doc with some things that are not only interesting for my beta but also good for me because I do intend some of those things to come back up later and having them noted will remind me. 

Does anyone else do something similar? What are y'alls methods of making sure the things you're trying to foreshadow (or things you intend to have a scene about or reference to later) actually work out?

I highly recommend trying doing running commentary in the comments of google docs if you do google docs! Especially if you share the google doc with an editor or beta readers, sometimes the comments might get you better suggestions/feedback about whether or not your current method of trying to get that point across is working."

624,t3_gaodxm,FanFiction,Writing and posting fanfiction makes me ridiculously happy :),"I've just joined this site after lurking for months since everyone's so nice and supportive and I really, really wanted to talk to people about fanfiction. The only person who knows I read/write fanfiction is my sister and she can't read anything over three pages long without losing interest and, yeah, I love her but not the best person to rant on and on about how much I love fanfic with.

So! I've been reading fanfiction for about five (or is it six?) years by now, and I can't even remember why I started but I'm so glad I did. Not all of them are well-written, but the ones that are, make everything worth the effort, and I love how I fall into new fandoms every once in a while. That happened to me with Naruto, BnHA, Avengers and a couple more that I can't remember at the moment. 

After a while though, I wanted to start writing fanfiction myself. I've always loved writing but could never find the time and it never occurred to me that I *could* write fanfics. It always felt like something other people did. 

And then all of a sudden I just decided, hey, why not? and since I've got all these ideas in my head (just because I've never really thought about putting them down on paper doesn't mean I haven't had them for years :)) I chose one and started writing. Posted my first about three or four years ago.

It, uh, ended up being abandoned after chapter two 'cause I didn't think of a plot before writing (only the OC) and got caught up with editing and editing because *it wasn't ever good enough* so, um, I kind of got scared about posting anything after that. It was actually decently received (in my opinion) with people reviewing and fav/following more than I expected and I didn't want to post anything when I wouldn't even finish, so I stopped posting and started writing.

But now that I didn't have to post, I kept touching on this fandom and that, thinking up OCs left and right and never got to actually writing past the first chapter if I ever even got to that stage. Again, not what I wanted. I wanted to write a *story,* something with a beginning and end and twists and turns along the way.

So I decided, since I'm terrible at sticking to one idea and knowing when to stop editing, why don't I just stop thinking as a whole? As in, don't think about 'what about writing a character like A?' or 'this part feels too awkward, why don't I rewrite? and for that matter, why not rewrite the whole fic?' So I stopped thinking too much, stopped letting my mind wander, and just began writing. 

*And it's great*.

I'm the type of writer who needs to post a chapter for it to feel finished, otherwise I'd end up clinging to it until it never sees the light of day, so I post almost as soon as I finish, only checking for any mistakes in grammar/spelling. That makes sure I don't keep working on it for days and months, and I love how it works for me. I've started looking forward to that time at night when I start writing and every time I post I go to sleep with a smile on my face.

That tingly feeling in my chest when I sit down to write? That's the *best*. 

Now I'm posting about once in two days, I've already written up to chapter 12, I've got a handful of reviews that make me giddy when I think of them, and sure, I'll probably never get a huge following like some people do since I know my writing isn't the best and I like writing OC fics, but still. I'm writing and posting and *actually sharing my ideas* and that makes me happy. 

This turned out longer than expected but I just wanted to share 'cause I'm really happy whenever I think of writing and I wanted to let it out!"
625,t3_gb2bf1,FanFiction,How to write music into fics?,"I really like doing modern aus when I write, something contradicting the magic au streak I'm on right now, but I was writing a story before taking a break to write my other fics. I like uploading chapter by chapter scenes to Wattpad before going and putting it as one work on ao3 just to get some recognition and motivation to continue without the promise of its finish being on my main writing place. I started writing a soulmate work with the concept of whatever song is stuck in your soulmate's head gets stuck in your head, including the parts just continuously repeating when you can only remember the chorus or the opening. There's another aspect to it but I'm not trying to get advice on it. 

I'm a very small writer everywhere as I'm new and this fic is the one with the most recognition on my Wattpad and I know some people wish for it to be continued as they've saved it. So, I wanted some help on writing music.  I don't want to just say, ""then \*insert song\* started playing in his head,"" like I did in my initial writing. I want advice on how to write in music. Especially since I want do fics based on songs all the time but aren't sure where to start."
626,t3_gaq3wl,FanFiction,So I got this review...,"Long....long time lurker here, but I'm so giddy about this, I gotta tell someone about it:

So here I am, after fighting an uphill battle against a particular chapter in my newest ongoing (damn you fight scenes, damn you) for the better part of a month, when I get a notification that I got a review on that very same story. ""Cool,"" I think to myself, ""they're slowly trickling up."" At this point, I'm honestly more encouraged by favs/follows than the rare reviews I get (I'd be lying if I said they didn't make me all warm and fuzzy on the inside though lol), but I click on it, half expecting another encouraging ""update soon!""

What I got instead is a guest reviewer not just calling my writing ""good"", no, he called it a ""masterpiece"".

I'm just...smiling like an idiot right now? I'm not gonna say my writing is trash, but I haven't put out anything in years...and my works before this have been...like night and day, to say the least lol Regardless, it feels good to know that someone considers little ol me's writing something to strive towards. 

Thanks for the motivational boost mysterious Guest, I'll be sure to put it to good use!"
627,t3_gb0dut,FanFiction,Horror Fanfic Exchange (nominations and signups are open until tomorrow),"[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/threedayrental01/profile](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/threedayrental01/profile)

A multifandom exchange (does not have to be a horror fandom) where you can request and offer fics with any pairing or no pairing, over 300 words, inspired by one or more horror films.

You can nominate any fandoms, horror film prompts, or pairings that aren't in the taglist, or make requests and offers for ones that are. It looks like it's going to be pretty good.

I've requested...a rarepair and a platonic fic between people who are more usually shipped, amongst a few others...but in some combinations with horror films that I think are quite interesting."
628,t3_gank19,FanFiction,Just start with one,"Set yourself an alarm on your phone, which repeats at the same time every day. Time it for when you're not doing anything; lunch break at work, an hour after you get home from school, right after dinner. Whatever. A time of day that you never do anything. And tell yourself that every time it goes off, you will write one sentence. Just one. Tell yourself that, it's important, because that's all you need to do. One sentence per day. That's easy. Even if you've hit a block in the story, you can still just write the *literal next thing that happens.* This will allow you to chip through the blocks one little bit at a time. And even better, sometimes you'll tell yourself it's just one sentence, but that one sentence will make you feel like writing more.

And if you miss your writing appointment, and are away from the device when the alarm goes off? No big deal. Just hit snooze, or wait until tomorrow.

This is what I've started doing, and it works. I hope it works for someone else too."
629,t3_gb4bx1,FanFiction,Any advice for finding a Beta Reader?,"It's been a while since I've written and I'm a little bit out of the loop as it were. I've got a decent chunk of a Dragon Age fic written up (\~20 000 words) but I kinda want someone to look over it before I start posting. I know [FF.net](https://FF.net) offers a thing to help you connect, but since I'm not planning on publishing there I'd feel weird using it as a medium for that. Are there other options, or should I just leave Beta requests in the first few chapters of the fic itself once it goes up?"

637,t3_gb1gbm,FanFiction,"I wrote half a book without realizing it was fanfiction! Made a video about it, thought you might enjoy","Hey everyone!

Long story short: I was reeeeally into Magic The Gathering 10 years ago (don't get me wrong, I still am, but I was cra-zey)  — a cardgame about battling wizards — and one of my biggest pleasures was to organize strange and whimsical tournaments, where we'd flip all the game's rules and have a lot of fun.

One day I tried to go all-in creative and organize a narrative tournament, kinda like a LARP, but our friends were not so keen as it would require moneyz.

So, inspired by the many existing Magic The Gathering books, me and a friend decided to write a book about the characters we'd created. Which, of course, was fanfiction! But we didn't realize by the time and didn't connect to the broader fanfic community.

I reeeally wish we did!

If that story sounds cool, [here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZvzkHDvYoA)! And hey, I would love if you could critique it! I wanna get better and better =)

Cheers and keep the words coming!"
638,t3_gbdgk6,FanFiction,I think the fic I was reading is an ad.,I found a fic and it was good for the first two chapters but then it had a whole chapter that was like an ad for a restaurant so I think the restaurant wrote it as an ad. I don't want to read an ad. I left a comment to tell the author I saw they did that but now they'll probably stop writing it because they know I know it's an ad. It was a good fic until the ad.

I read back my old stuff now though and kind of can’t believe it was me writing, feels like a different lifetime ago. Some of it I’m really quite proud of, but I’ve tried so many times since and every-time I open a blank document now I just can’t get any words out of my head. I feel like I’ve “lost” the ability to write now. I also worry that nobody would be interested anyway as there’s so many other great writers now. Does anyone else ever feel the same?

Since I only read English stories, I kind of didn't know about it. I've been considering rewrite my story, so far I only typed 16k words, but I'm somewhat afraid of doing so, because I'm not used to write in English, never even tried doing so.

i should probably add that this is a crossover that follows the plot line of the series i’m talking about, and one character from another series ends up in that world and i feel like this character would have some really interesting reactions?? idk. 

but at the same time i have a feeling that a lot of my readers are anime only fans, and i don’t want to spoil them at all. the last few arcs are something that i feel should be experienced by reading the manga and not just explained by some dumbass on ao3 lmao. should i just put spoiler warnings on the chapter before and the beginning of the chapter where there might be spoiler stuff? at the same time i feel like that won’t be a proper ending to people who stop reading at that point, which is a little unfair imo. 

i’m quite a bit away from this yet. i’ve got maybe 4 or 5 main arcs and a few mini arcs to cover before i even get to the manga stuff, but i thought i’d ask before i get to that point.

I'm asking something like ""They have to debate waffles are superior to pancakes whatever they like it or not. what do they said? what do they do? Go!"" or it could be goofy, it could be serious. Preferly think outside the box."

I was reading a series and I had to stop on the third story.  The author just blatantly plagiarized entire sections of the original author's work -- some of the dialog was almost word for word.  Seriously, it is author's such as this that give fanfiction a bad name.    It is a shame, because the author had a great idea and I was very excited to see where the fic went.  It was one of those fics where I gave a kudos early on in the 1st fic (I think chapter 1 or 2 --IDK) and now I just want to take it back.   Every once in a while,  they would diverge from canon and those lovely little nuggets kept me hopeful, but they were few and far between.

Why do some authors feel the need to go to the original work and extract dialogue to put into their fanwork.  Do they not know any better or are they just lazy?

EDIT:  I found an [interesting forum on FF.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/2872/178677764/1/Question) in which copying is considered plagiarism or not.  I love reading threads like this, because it gives a variety of perspectives."

673,t3_ganfpv,FanFiction,What would be the weirdest fandoms to do crossovers with?,"To be clear, though I say ""fandoms,"" even IPs (intellectual properties) with essentially no fandom would be fine. I'm looking for both:

1. What the weirdest two IPs to cross over would be (regardless of whether or not any crossovers between them already exist), and

2. What the weirdest single IP to cross over with *anything* would be - something where the very idea of crossing it over with anything at all would be weird. (The fact that it's crossing over with something is what needs to be weird - the IP itself being weird wouldn't be enough on its own and isn't even necessarily required.)

If you only have an answer for one and not the other, that's totally fine. And to be clear, I like weird stuff and I'm hoping to get some ideas from this. ""Weird"" as a concept isn't meant to be a bad thing, though it's fine if you think the crossover would also be a terrible idea so long as you don't bash anything."

They basically said that it was their favorite fanfiction and they were sad it stopped updating. Their comment was part of the reason why I came back, but now I've seen them comment on every single chapter of 2 other people's fanfictions. Meanwhile, they have commented once on mine, and I've posted 5 chapters since they said they missed my fiction. The latest chapter which was a very important chapter and which I stated I really wanted comments on, they did not comment on. This makes me both angry and depressed. My fiction is their favorite but I'm not worthy of comments as much as the other fictions? After seeing them comment on the other fictions I don't even feel like updating mine anymore. Can anyone else relate?

edit: problem solved. They couldn't find my fic. From sounds of it they were filtering out some tags I added in some months ago. "

676,t3_gap0s3,FanFiction,Beta Bartering [Find or Offer Fic Betaing] - April 30,"Welcome to Beta Bartering!  Here you can look for a Beta for your fic or offer your Beta services to fic authors.

The rules are straightforward.  

* Make a comment below with the following information.

* Reply to people that you want to trade with.  There is no one making matches for you, reach out to likely people in the thread.

If you're **looking for a Beta:**

* Name and Link to your fic (if it's not published, link something else as an example of your writing).

* What fandom you're writing for.

* Can someone who isn't in your fandom make sense of your story?

* The genre of your fic - romance/smut/gen/mystery/horror/etc.

* What you're looking for from a Beta - Grammar/Structure/Plot/Planning/Idea soundboard/etc.

* What your projected word count is.

* How frequently you update.

* What fandoms you are able/willing to beta for **or** what you can offer in exchange. *

If you're **willing to Beta** for someone:

* What fandoms you're well versed in or if you're willing to take on anything.

* Preferred genre/types of fics.

* Any subjects you're **not** willing to tackle.

* Types of Betaing you're good at or willing to try - Grammar/Structure/Plot/Planning/Idea soundboard/etc.

* Minimum or maximum word count.

* One-off (single session) or ongoing Betaing.

* Time constraints.  Do you have a fast turn-around time?  Is it going to be more than a week for you to get back to an author with notes?

* What you'd like in exchange * for your services.

\* **Bartering!**

Since some people want Betas and are too busy to reciprocate or aren't confident in their writing skills... and some Betas don't write fics themselves, you can offer other things in exchange.  (Let's stay away from monetary exchanges, shall we?)

Here are a few ideas for bartering:

* Reciprocal Betaing (of course that's welcome!)

* Write a fic for a fandom/subject/pairing/brotp of their choice.

677,t3_gag9bs,FanFiction,Tips for starting to write Fanfic for a first-time writer?,"I have been a fanfiction reader for a bit more than a decade now and I still enjoy it immensly to this day. However, I have not yet made the step into writing fanfiction myself. Through COVID-19, self-isolation and exploring of new FanFic Series the urge to write myself seems to grow more and more everyday. The problem is that I have no idea where to start. To make it a bit more organised about all the points I am considering and waffeling about, please see the bullet point list below:

* Weirdly enough I have never managed to cultivate (online) friends through Fanfiction and thus nobody that I really talk to about Fanfiction. Most of my friends really don't understand it.
* As a perfectionist here, I am really contemplating if I should start of my fanfiction writer career by starting to write one-shots/short stories or a longer more developed, plot-oriented and researched story.
* Reasons why I want to start writing; For example within the HP Fandom have read many varied and amazing stories, but (maybe this sounds weird) not a story that hits like all the major points I wish a story would hit. Additionally some other Fandoms (example is the tv show Haven) have some great pieces, but I think not nearly enough and I would like to add to it.

Basically, any tips of how you FanFic writers start your process, pull your inspiration, build your OC'S, plot your plot, incorporate a truly shocking plot twist and any other tid-bits that can help me start, would be very welcome!

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thanks for all the wonderful advice, I'm gonna have a crack at it!"
678,t3_gasnns,FanFiction,For any fandom,"What should my MC's kids (ages 4 and 16) get for her boyfriend for Christmas? He's gotten them some things and he's been dating their mom for a month (but was best friends with her back in high school), and what should my MC's boyfriend's 8 year old son get her for Christmas? She got him something, too, but it's sweet to get things for the kids, maybe awkward for kids to get adults their parents are dating, something for Christmas."
679,t3_gai3hl,FanFiction,Supportive of Your Fanfics?,"Today, I definitely saw how supportive my mom is of me writing fanfic.

A bit of backstory: my mom loves writing fiction, but she uses her creative writing degree for marketing, and now owns her own advertising agency writing copy and being a creative head. She does have fiction books in the works, but she's more focused on her business at the moment.

She's known I've written fanfiction since high school, and will actually help me out if I'm stuck on something and she also is interested in the fandom I'm writing about (a surprising few because she is also a nerd). She has read some of my stories (if it's not smutty) and even told me that one fic I wrote as a gift was my best character work she's ever read.

Among my mom's many talents, she's also in a band where she sings, plays a few instruments, and writes her own songs. She's been a musical person for as long as she can remember and has been writing songs since she was 17.

Today, since I didn't have work to do, I decided to get started on the 3rd installment of my Witcher series ""The Bard &amp; The Witcher"". In my fic, I go into how Jaskier wrote a ballad about the monster hunt that happened in my last fic. I was stuck because I've never written a song before, and I'm not musically inclined apart from listening to music and singing in the shower. I just knew that Jaskier has a tendency to exaggerate stories and that I wanted 'true love's kiss' to be how Jaskier recovered from a wound in the song. I told mom when she had a break from work that I was stressed about writing a Jaskier song, and she just started making up lyrics. In 10 minutes, we ended up writing a Witcher ballad complete with embellishments a-la-Jaskier.

The craziest part is that my mom only saw 2 episodes of the show and declared it wasn't really her thing. And the only reason she listened to ""Toss a Coin to Your Witcher"" and ""Her Sweet Kiss"" is because I asked her to. She already got a feel for Jaskier's songs because of that and got the song spot on. In writing the song, she asked me questions about my story and the lore of the monster I used so she could accurately write the song. She's even going to record herself performing it for me.

Do you have any friends or family who are supportive of your work like this?"
680,t3_gai2uq,FanFiction,Good Omens,"Hi people!

I just finished Good Omens and as I was binging it about every 5 minutes I thought ""damn, this is good fanfic material"" so now that I've finished it I'm almost giddy with the idea of the new fics out there waiting to be read \^ \^ .

And I'd thought I'd ask here if any of you have some favourites you could recommend me?"
681,t3_garigu,FanFiction,Can fan fiction be converted into video?,Is there any platform out there which can convert fan fiction into a simple video with very little design work? How amazing would it be if we could easily put out videos of our stories with very little character design?
682,t3_g9z7z4,FanFiction,I did it!,"I can't stop crying! I've completed my first ever work. It might not be perfect or good but I finished it and I'm so happy. 80k words! I've basically written and light novel. I'm excited for the next project, hopefully it'll be better than the first. Thank you to this subreddit for allowing me to post this celebration!

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you for all the well wishes, I feel like Im on top of the world. Thank you so much kind strangers! Happy writing."
683,t3_gaodhy,FanFiction,Destiny and Mass Effect Crossover,"Was thinking about making a Destiny and Rising of the Shield Hero crossover but decided to change it to Destiny and Mass Effect. Figured it might be easier given they are kinda similar to each other, but more to the point, I was wondering if anyone knew a good point where to start the story? Mass Effect to my understanding is very complicated given that you can make many different choices in the story that’s effects the final outcome, but to make it simpler, would it be better to start the story in Mass Effect 1 or 2?

There are more details I want to go over so expect some other edits."

685,t3_gaekyd,FanFiction,FFN bug?,"Had anyone seen ads coming up in the middle of stories on FFN? Starting today perhaps? I I just brought up the site on PC and every paragraph or so there's an ad now and it definitely wasn't like that yesterday. The weird thing is it only happens on Chrome for PC, not on my phone or even Firefox"
686,t3_ga6ap3,FanFiction,I broke my word count record... again,"Made a similar post a few days ago, but I did it again! And I’m so happy, my last record is 1,722 and now it’s 2,022, so I broke by 300 on the dot, not a lot in retrospect, but I’m very happy! I feel like the chapter is very well composed, not too wordy, and very similar to my idol’s writing style, J feel that it is very easy to read. It’s currently 5:30 in the morning and I’m supposed to be in bed, but my sleep schedule is all messed up and I had that idea and it wouldn’t go away. I’m proofreading in the morning though."
687,t3_gab62r,FanFiction,"What's the best way to phrase ""I really want you to update soon!"" in a review?","Because let's face it, when you find a great fic you really want to encourage the author to keep going, and fast! But saying that outright can be a stressor for authors, or feel demanding. 

I tend to express it as ""I can't wait to see how ~specific plot thread~ plays out!"" but would love advice if there's a better way!"
688,t3_gamnyf,FanFiction,Forgot a My Hero Academia fanfiction and want to find it!,"I remember the fanfiction fairly well but dont remember what it's called. Tried looking up what about it was special but didnt get anything.

I remember that it was Izuku was born with OFA and he couldn't control it and would break everything (not himself like in canon). Then Recovery Girl found him and helped him train to control it, and eventually gave him a rabbit to prove he was able to control it. Meanwhile All Might tried to give Togata OFA but it didnt work."
689,t3_gam9f0,FanFiction,Help finding a Naruto fic,"There's a fic I remember reading a while back that I can't find anymore. 

The only part of I remember is that during the bell test, either an oc in Sakura's body, Sakura herself, or a stand in for her tries to intentionally fail the test because she doesn't think they are ready. I believe Kakashi calls her out on this saying she ""didn't want to be on this team anyway"", and the team is made regardless of her wishes.

Any help is appreciated."
690,t3_gadpu6,FanFiction,Ever write a story that is a start to a series but the next story in line doesn't do as well as the first?,"I'm writing my own sort of series of fanfics that all follow the same sort of plot and the first story was really well received. I've already started the second fic in the series but the story is only half as popular as the first, is this normal and when I've written more, will it get more popular?"

692,t3_gaf19e,FanFiction,What to purge and what not to purge?,"So I've been writing fanfiction about ten years now. Looking back at some of my old stories especially at the beginning makes me want to laugh and cringe so much. I'd really like to delete some of my old stories but looking at the stats I'm seeing people are still reading some of my old stuff. 

Part of me wants to keep some of it up since it shows my progress as a writer. The other part wants to delete it all. I figured some other writers might have went through the same thing and thought to ask what you guys have done."
693,t3_gafvcb,FanFiction,Questions about translating for Russian speakers,"I'm in the process of translating one of my fics into Russian. Not because it's been a big hit (it hasn't), but because I'm trying to improve my writing ability and this seemed like a good way to do it. I'm not fluent in this language so it's slow going and I can never really be sure if I'm doing things wrong, or indeed, *how* wrong I'm doing them.

I have a few questions for native Russian speakers. Hopefully there are some on this sub. How do you indicate dialogue and what tense do people typically write in when telling a story? Also, any other tips for writing in Russian that I should know about to make it sound more natural?"
694,t3_ga3lnz,FanFiction,Started my 20th(?) fanfic in 2017 after many failed attempts. Finished it yesterday.,"I FINALLY FINISHED MY FANFIC YESTERDAY! It took 3 years of on and off writing, and after I stopped and started so many others, I swore to myself that I would finish it and I did. I'm extremely proud of myself.

It also crossed 300 reads on wattpad (which I realize is a small number compared to a lot of others) but it makes me extremely happy. To all the others out there questioning whether they should finish their own works, I hope this gives you some encouragement. It is so definitely worth it.

Good luck! :)"
695,t3_gaajy6,FanFiction,Readers relationship with fandoms. How do you go about reading?,"There are some fandoms that are old faithfuls. I always return back to and see what’s happening in them but I don’t read on a frequent basis- HP, Star Trek. 


I find I tend to watch a new film or tv show and go search out the fanfic for those, reading only fics in that fandom for a few weeks before checking up on my old ones. 

But has anyone else also gotten into fandoms of things they’ve never even watched? I read a fanfic, looked up what else the author had wrote, read an intriguing fic by them even though I knew nothing of that tv show, loved it, it got me hooked. I’ve still not seen anything of the tv show but I still love reading fanfics for it. There are  just so many creative writers in that fandom. Every now and then I have to research a character that’s mentioned in a fic to see what they’re like."

702,t3_ga1vrx,FanFiction,"Anxiety about ""using up my good ideas"" on fanfiction","Just as background, I studied Creative Writing in grad school and now teach writing in university. Writing is essentially my career. I try to publish short fiction when I can, even though recently I've hit a bit of a slump.

Lately I've been having lots of cool ideas for possible fanfiction, but at the same time nurturing a growing worry that I might be robbing myself of interesting characters, moments, scene descriptions, or dialogue from my ""real fiction"" if I go on with it. What if I write a stellar piece of fanfiction only to later wish I had that punchy line of dialogue back? Obviously I don't want to self-plagiarize. 

I'm aware this is kind of a dumb problem, but I'm curious if anyone else here has struggled with it.

Tl;dr I don't want to use up all my best ""writing ammo"" on something that's just for fun rather than something for my career."

704,t3_g9tz81,FanFiction,I left a toxic fandom and am celebrating my 3rd year on AO3!,"I had been a part of this fandom for about 10 months (somewhat, I was mostly lurking towards the end). It had always been somewhat toxic, what with the fact it's an RPF, but I finally was able to realize I wanted out. I had one WIP in it, which I closed down and marked as abandoned. I cleaned out my tumblr for that fandom and remade it into one for my current (and much nicer) fandom. I unfollowed everybody related to that fandom. I just couldn't be a part of the drama anymore. 

And boy, does it feel like a weight lifted off my shoulders! I don't have this pressure to finish a work I don't find enjoyment in. I don't have to worry about being flamed or doxxed anymore. It's great. 

On a lighter note, I'm also celebrating three years on AO3! I've been on this amazing website for 3 years now. In fact, I still remember checking my phone after seventh grade PE class on the way to math and seeing my invitation e-mail, and signing up right after school. It took me a couple of months to post my first fic, but I don't regret signing up for it at all.

Now, three years later...wow. I've been in amazing fandoms, toxic fandoms, tiny fandoms, slightly less tiny fandoms...

Amazing how time flies, especially with good fic at your fingertips! Thank you so much to every single volunteer, donater, and author on AO3. You make the fan world go 'round. Thank you for all that you do.

(And to the readers: Thank you so much for your never-ending support! You guys mean so much to me &lt;3)

AO3 and fandom in general has been a bright spot in getting me through these tough times. This community is amazing."
705,t3_g9y6n2,FanFiction,"Adds, adds, and more adds. Fanfiction.net I trusted you!","Alright, I have to ask, is anyone else finding web adds in the middle of fanfiction. I was on my computer today when I found an ad in the middle of the fanfiction I was reading.

So far the only fanfictions I can read on my computer without ads are the ones I published myself.

Is [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net) running out of revenue so much that they resorted to placing adds in the middle of stories or is this an error in the add program that recently popped up and has yet to be fixed?"
706,t3_ga7tzb,FanFiction,Teen Wolf - Couples Counseling?,"Howdy! I feel like I am going nuts trying to find this fic.

It is a teen wolf fic where Stiles and Derek are moving apart. Like Derek lets the pack treat Stiles like trash, and Stiles gets therapy. He tries to get Derek to go to couples counseling, though Derek never shows up so he leaves.

Lydia and Jackson are going through a tough time, and I’m pretty sure Stiles buys and apartment because Derek won’t let him decorate. There is also a side OC who has a thing for Stiles.

I’m 90% certain it was unfinished on AO3, but none of my tag searches are working."
707,t3_g9xdsh,FanFiction,How Do You Feel About Non Traditional Tags?,"I personally like it when the tags are silly or ultra specific. It makes me feel like I'm talking to the author and getting a bit more of a glimpse into their writing style/personality. I also notice that these types of tags stand out to me as a reader and I'm more intrigued to read the summary (on AO3 if the tags don't interest me I don't read the summary).

Some of my favorites are 'author wishes to be fought' &amp; 'because they love each other damnit' &amp; 'I ruin character A's life and feel bad about it' &amp; 'Character B's a dick' &amp; 'I meant to do this' &amp; 'I just want them to be happy' &amp; 'Character A is a good bean' &amp; 'idiots in love' &amp;  'The au no one asked for' &amp; 'I'm sorry I made this'

I've heard that these kinds of tags annoy some people but I think they're a really fun way to talk about your story and what the reader can expect.

I usually have some of these in my own stories and I'm wondering if it's really a turn off for most people? Do you ignore them? Do you not like them because they cover up the 'real' tags?"
708,t3_ga501h,FanFiction,Would you still read a fanfic that had slight religious/Christian references?,"I saw another post recently talking about this, and the general consensus was kind of negative, which has me a bit concerned because of the slight religious stuff in one of the fics I’m planning. So I thought I’d describe what I’m doing and see whether people would still be willing to read the fic.

I’m currently in the planning stages for an Ancient Roman AU in one of my fandoms. When I write an AU, I like to go for broke on the research bit of it and make it as historically accurate as possible. So, after all that research, my story’s emperor- the Big Bad- has basically become a cross between Nero and Caligula. And both of those guys have a bit of a reputation for not being especially friendly towards early Christians, which I decided to use as a plot point. I needed a reason for the Big Bad to hate a particular character, so I decided to have that character and two of his friends be early Roman Christians. It wasn’t an arbitrary decision; it advances the plot, and all three of them have a very “goody-two-shoes” personality in canon already, so I felt it worked well. 

Literally the only mention of Christianity is “these three are Christians which is why this guy hates them.” That’s it. Theology isn’t discussed or debated, and I don’t use it to preach at my readers. I don’t show any of the characters praying or going to church or any of that; it’s just stated as a fact about them, in the same vein as “he had blond hair.” It doesn’t factor into the story beyond serving as a historically-accurate reason why these three are on the emperor’s bad side. None of them are main characters either, just side characters.

I didn’t think people would have a problem with it, seeing as how I’m not preaching or starting debates, I’m just using it as a fact. But after reading through some of the comments on the other post about religion in fanfics, I figured it’d be a good idea to explain my specific plan for the story and ask whether it would be a turn-off for readers before I start writing. I’d appreciate your thoughts!"
709,t3_g9zu11,FanFiction,How to Politely Drop a Fic?,"I'm in a few discord servers from my main fandom and one of them has a relatively novice writer that just posted their first fic for the fandom.

Wanting to support a new writer, I decided to pick the fic up and have been regularly commenting on the updates. However, as of late the fic has gone in a direction that I REALLY cannot support. Basically, the fic is a bit of a love triangle between a girl and two guys, and the girl recently got sexually assaulted by one of those guys.

And according to the author in discord, the guy that did the sexual assault is planned to be the endgame pairing with the girl... and for me, I guess this is just a bit triggering? I don't think I'll be able to continue reading/commenting on the fic if that's what is planned. But I feel SO bad because the author is new and already doesn't have many readers (outside of the discord).

Is there a nicer way to approach this...? I just feel at a loss in this situation and I really don't want to discourage this author, but I also don't want to keep reading a fic that is emotionally distressing for me. The author will no doubt notice if I suddenly stop commenting and will likely bring it up in discord."

We are talking about a 6k words chapters in 3 person and written as past, so its a littel bit hard."
711,t3_g9zzn5,FanFiction,... oof. First roast (and/or troll) review.,"Hello everyone, not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish with this other than getting it off my chest so that I can get back to focusing on writing. Apologies in advance if this comes off as whining!

Basically as the title says, I received my first ever blisteringly negative review on my longfic. The reason I think it could potentially be a trolling attempt is that's it's a rare review from a guest account that starts off with ""bad fic, absolutely bungled everything up. bad premise, bad setting, bad storyline, bad everything"" and never really gets any more specific from there.

Now I've been absolutely blessed with reviews that range from positive to concriit, the latter of which I genuinely appreciated and did my best to incorporate into my work. I guess what's annoying about reviews like this is that there's nothing I can really glean from it to improve my writing in the future. 

Anyway that's it, I appreciate having this space to vent and thanks to anyone who read this. :)"

Now for how to play this game. :)

**Posting fics for review:**

* Select a passage from a fic you want a comment/review on.  
* There is a soft **limit of 500 words**.  [Not your whole fic.](https://i.imgur.com/NTb9Mwu.gif)
* Top level comments should be fic snippets. 
* First line should be `Fandom | Title | Rating | Link - AO3, FFN, etc.`
* Copy and paste your fic tidbit directly to the thread. (Unless...)
 * Fics rated Mature or Explicit are welcome, 
  * **BUT do not post plain text** of scenes that contain explicit sexual situations,  extreme depictions of violence, or underage content.  **Links** to these fics, with appropriate tags/warnings, are acceptable.
 * If the specific scene you've chosen to post contains none of this, please warn those who might go link-clicking about the content in the rest of the fic.

* If you, for whatever reason, would not like the review also put on your actual fic, please say so.

* **If you contribute a fic, you must leave a review for someone else!**

---

Formatting example:

**Fandom | Title | Rating | Link to offsite**

(new line, double enter) *Any applicable warnings*

(new line, double enter) Your fic text.

---

**Leaving reviews:**

* Above all, be kind.
*  30+ words when leaving reviews, please.  This is to promote fair play and level the field. If you want to ramble on from there, go right ahead!
* Quoting parts of the fic *does not* count toward your review word count.
* **It is highly encouraged to review in this thread and also copy/paste it to the actual fic or chapter they've linked.**
* If you see something that doesn't have a review yet, please try to give it a read to spread the love around.
* If you have the time, reviewing more than one fic would be a thoughtful thing to do.  If you're here, you'd probably like to get more than one, so why not give an extra or three yourself?  This community thrives when people contribute to it, and the more people participate, the more people we tend to get in these threads.

---


* If you just want to hang out and review fics without putting in your own, you're more than welcome to!

---

**Tips and tricks for leaving a positive review:**

When a line catches your eye, quote it and say what you liked about it.

If there's an overarching theme or technicality the author did well, point it out.

If you get a nifty theory about where the plot's going, share it!  Try to keep your phrasing positive: ""I think X is going to rob the train, that'd be cool!"" rather than demanding: ~~""X and Y should bang now and that's how it's going to end or you, the author, are wrong.""~~  *Bzzzt, wrong answer!*

Be clear about *why* you liked certain parts.  Elaborate if you can!

If the fic made you feel something, most of the time, that would be a good thing to add.

You may have no clue about the fandom, but did you get a good sense of a character, or the scenery, or the plot, the action, the feeling of the scene, the interactions, the dialogue?  I'm sure they'd like to know!

And, honestly, if you feel the need to get your squee on in here, I really doubt there's going to be objections to the occasional ""asdhgdasdfsadf"" key smash or emojis as decorative additions to your review. :D

Don't forget to have fun!"
716,t3_g9s9to,FanFiction,Excessive crying in fic?,"I've noticed that in fic, especially when the main/pov character is a woman, there's just so much crying. As soon as something difficult happens, BAM, tears prickling her eyes. Remembers something sad? TEARS. She overhears something she wasn't meant to? SOBBING. She's a Strong Female Character but she's just so overwhelmed by \[completely understandable and predictable development\]!

Obviously this isn't every fic, but it is a trend I've noticed and it drives me nuts. Emotionally healthy adults do not act like this, right? It makes the character I'm reading feel like a child who doesn't know how to look after herself and is instead constantly blubbering about how she's sorry for overreacting while the love interests wrap her in their strong, masculine arms and tell her it's okay, she's the strongest woman they've ever met, etc ad infin.

**Edit: I'm not trying to say crying is a sign of weakness or strong characters cannot be emotional too. My complaint is when writers use crying as a one-size-fits-all way to portray any kind of extreme emotion.**

**Edit 2: ....when they don't behave that way in canon and there's no context explaining why they may be emotionally vulnerable.**

(For context, I just read a fic where the main character cried multiple times a chapter, just whenever she felt moved by anything. It was exhausting.)"

726,t3_g9p7zi,FanFiction,"Since starting to write fanfiction, i haven't looked forward to something so much in years!","Just for context: i have depression and anxiety. My life isn't going very great, every day was a blur and i am used to feeling kind of numb. I don't have much money and my parents don't want to pay for hobbies (understandable).

So i got really into an anime recently, specifically a pairing. I really love their dynamic and all the headcanons the fandom has about them, i even see myself in one of the characters. I've been reading fanfiction since 12 i think? 

but i never thought i was capable of writing something. Turns out i am!

I just started 2 months ago and IT'S SO MUCH FUN! i get very nervous when opening the document because i am very bad at it, and i could be doing something ""useful"" instead, but i can't really stop now 

i'm constantly thinking about the plot and sometimes dialogue or phrases come into my head out of nowhere! It's really fun when the characters are together and they just ""click"", it's easy to see them interact and talk to each other in my head. 

My first fic wasn't good, and it got a bad review. I deleted the fic, but then i just. Kept going and i'm in the middle of another one. And i'm liking it a lot too! i think i might have improved, and i hope readers like this one.

This may seem weird but it's huge for me! i don't deal well with discouragement at all, i'm actually proud that i kept going even when nervous and was okay. I wake up looking forward to writing even a few sentences or just editing everyday

And even if my writing is awful, i get really happy thinking about someone enjoying it (18 kudos on the second chapter! i know some people leave pity kudos but at least one of them must have found joy in my fic :) i think that's wonderful)

There isn't really a point to this post, just gushing about how writing is helping me and how i like it! Do any of you feel this way too?"
727,t3_g9wkqv,FanFiction,Ads in the middle of story on fanfiction.net,"The title says it all. Usually the ads are in the beginning and end of the chapter, but now there are multiple ads smack in the middle, and it's really disturbing the reading experience. 

I understand that they need the ads, but I feel like this is too much. Might have to permanently migrate over to Ao3. Is anyone else experiencing this?"
728,t3_ga4eh0,FanFiction,Having word count goals,"Years of reading and writing fanfics have truly skewed my perception on word counts. I only ever write one-shots, and I have a tendency to set goals between 15k - 25k for ""longer fics"", depending on how long the outline is.

Sometimes, I think having a word count goal is extremely motivating. I like to keep track of how many words I write a day, and it's always sooo satisfying when I enter a large number into my spreadsheet. Other times, having a goal feels so extremely demoralizing, and especially when you realize you've only written 100 words all day, all motivation goes out the window.

I've always been curious as to how other authors work on their wips! I've tried not looking at the word count at all, but I'm too obsessed with numbers and how much progress is made to be able to do that.

Which comes to my question, do you guys like having goals for your word count (whether it's for a one-shot, or for an entire chaptered fic or per chapter)? Do you have a daily goal? Do you find it beneficial to have goals?

730,t3_g9xohf,FanFiction,"Looking for Star Wars fics where Anakin doesn't turn to the dark side, but Palpatine survives","Many years again on alternatehistory.com, a user posted a well fleshed out scenario where Anakin doesn't turn to the Dark Side and Palpatine flees when he can't make an apprentice out of him. I've had a clean break with the site and it's admins but I remember the following details:

* the initial PoD (point of divergence) is when Grevious throws Obi-Wan a little bit harder during their fight. This allows Grevious to get away, and Obi-Wan heads back to Coruscant in time to give Anakin the push he needs to not be swayed by Palpatine.
* Sidious flees after his duel with Mace Windu, and goes to the Separatists, telling them to ramp up battle droid production (with the Republic after him, he has no reason for Gunray, Tambor, etc to be held back).
* Tarkin, who values loyalty to Sidious over the Republic, defects and becomes the new head of state for the CIS.
* Sidious takes Asajj Ventress as a temporary apprentice. After Padme gives birth, Grevious/Ventress is sent to kidnap the twins. Palpatine's goal is to raise both of them in the dark side, but only gets away with Luke. He is subsequently raised like a Sith apprentice by Sidious, and fed lies about his family by his master.
* Some detail is given to the war over next 18 years, but the second half of the story takes place around the same time as the events of Episode IV. Anakin tells Luke ""I am your father"" in an author designed ironic role reversal. Ultimately, Luke is brought back and is the instrument to Palpatine's downfall.

While I doubt I'll be able to find that particular story again, I was wondering if anyone had encountered anything similar. There are a lot of ""Anakin stays good"" type stories, but few where the Clone Wars continue."

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Jacksickle**

You're Jack Torrance, a frustrated writer, husband, father and recovering alcoholic, who takes the job of winter caretaker at the remote Overlook Hotel, hoping to break your dry spell. But the hotel is haunted and you're plagued by visions that you deal with less well than your twitchy six-year-old boy. Next thing you're getting drunk with ghost bartenders and terrorising your family with an axe. In the book you get blown up along with the hotel for failing to tend the dicky boiler, but in the movie you freeze to death after chasing your crafty kid into a maze. *(The Shining, by Stephen King)*

**2. Wrung out**

You're Bilbo Baggins, hobbit of the Shire, bachelor about town, proud of your home in a hole and its well-stocked larder. But you're pals with notorious stoner Gandalf the Grey, who tricks you into an adventure that nearly gets you killed by trolls, elves, dwarves, a dragon and a malevolent former hobbit called Gollum. And to make matters worse you forget your handkerchief. Your only bit of luck – finding a ring of invisibility – turns on you when it's revealed as the ultimate ring of power and transforms you into a wraith-ish addict. You write 'The Hobbit', aka 'There and Back Again, A Hobbit's Tale', and pass the ring to your nephew Frodo. Which ruins his life into the bargain, but he does manage to knock out 'The Lord of the Rings'. *(The Hobbit, by JRR Tolkien)*

**3. Demolished**

You're Ford Prefect, writer-at-large for 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy'. On assignment to Earth you're nearly run over and name yourself after a car, initially believing automobiles to be the dominant species. Given the Ford Prefect was discontinued in 1961, the joke implicit in your name is incomprehensible to anyone under 50 (at a pinch), plus your best friend is an errant man-from-out-of-space, a character more 1970s than the band from The Muppets. You're nearly demolished on Earth, thrown into space, attacked by missiles and trapped on a spaceship aimed at the sun. Worse still, your sidekick is a whining Brit in a dressing gown and your comprehensive review of Earth is reduced to the words ""Mostly Harmless"". *(The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams)*

**4. Hounded**

You're John H Watson, known as Dr Watson, and your best pal and flatmate Sherlock Holmes is a cocaine-addled egotist. He drags you into mysteries at great risk to your own life but doesn't let you in on his stratagems, including fake sickness and fake death. He generally dicks you around. Even in your own accounts of the adventures you share, you seem like a fool, and you must endure being patronized daily, not to mention Holmes' squalid untidiness. Frankly, it's a miracle you don't empty your service revolver into his face while screaming ""Deduce this Motherfu....!"" *(The Sherlock Holmes series, by Arthur Conan Doyle)*

**5. Humiliated**

You're Bridget Jones and you have a perfect relationship with a grape called Chardonnay, but your interfering mother insists you get off with dull Darcy from next door, because your life is a weird echo of Pride and Prejudice. Lust is your guide and you're defiled by a two-faced cad, played by ""Huge Gland"" (as the 'Four Weddings' actor is known in Japan) in the movie adaptation. Your attempts at betterment in the world of media lead to national humiliation and, worse, your ghastly cheating mother was right all along about the man of your dreams. In a humiliating twist, you're played in the movie by an actress significantly shorter and fatter than your byline photograph. *(Bridget Jones' Diary, by Helen Fielding)*

**6. Duped**

You're Samson Young, an American writer living in London, suffering from writer's block and terminal illness. You meet smoking hot sexpot Nicola Six, who's got a date with death on Bonfire Night... plus ghastly small-time crook Keith Talent and nice-but-dim Guy Clinch. You're staying in the flat of famous-for-being-famous English writer Mark Asprey, who shares initials and wankerishness with author Martin Amis. Half in love with Nicola you turn into her appointed monster, while Mark Asprey steals your story, her story, the story. *(London Fields, by Martin Amis)*

**7. Hobbled**

You're Paul Sheldon, writer of pulp romances. You've just finished the novel of your life, a balls-out work of true literary merit, but you crash your car in a remote part of snowy Colorado, only to be rescued by ""number one fan"" Annie Wilkes. The good bit is that she loves you and is game for tending you back to health. The bad is she's madder than a badger, burns your novel and chops off your foot – or smashes your already auto-wrecked legs with a sledgehammer if you're watching the movie. Finally you bash her skull in. It's ok though, you're able to rewrite your good novel AND publish the pulp job she's encouraged... so critically and financially you're aces, it's just the old walking's a bit tricky. Not to mention the nightmares. *(Misery, by Stephen King)*"

I especially loved E.B. White's description of figuring things out on his own, only to find out that he's gone about it in some weird, convoluted way that made things harder for himself, because if that ain't a fanfiction mood! Also just a really nice narrative from a person who came to writing in a roundabout, nontraditional way, which I can certainly relate to. 

It's not specifically about fanfiction, of course, but given that we get so many posts from new writers who are unsure where/how to start writing, I thought it might be helpful to someone.

I've come up with his entire backstory, his personality, and role in the series, but I can't come up with a name or how he'd even look. He's pretty much a god (or the equivalent of one for the series). His main ability is being able to create illusions to trick and manipulate people. He always tends to keep the situation humorous, even if he's causing the literal end of the world (for example: ""You know, I really took to heart what you told me before. I've decided that destroying this world is not enough for me. I will destroy all worlds instead, and become the king of the new ones I build upon their barren frames! I sincerely thank you for the suggestion, I'll invoice you later.""). I'm mainly looking for name suggestions, but if anyone has an idea for appearance that would also be greatly appreciated.

744,t3_g9pkez,FanFiction,Outside-the-box type things you've seen authors do that enhance the story,"I love when authors do things out of the ordinary that seem like they probably shouldn’t work in general but do for whatever reason in the context of their story, especially with text formatting. There’s a *Static Shock* oneshot I came across where Richie’s thoughts play a major role in it due to how intrusive and constant they are. Rather than just being in italics, they’re also colored blue to make them stand out from the rest of the text and it’s mostly just random math/science stuff haphazardly strewn together like it’s a constant flood of technical information that can't really be controlled, which is pretty much what it’s like in the canon too from what I understand. The oneshot itself is very bittersweet and the use of that formatting definitely adds to the ""bitter"" part as it really shows you the pure hell it must be to have powers that you never asked for nor can ever turn off from his perspective. I’ve never before nor since seen anything like this done anywhere else."

Sometimes I don’t post for months or even years on end and then I rewatch something and I’m like “ah yes, I should write”. 


This happened to me recently. I replayed my favorite game after months of not caring about fandom at all and wrote a one-shot that I don’t feel is particularly great, but which scratched my itch for writing.


Lo and behold, I wake up to comments and bookmarks from people who read my previous works a long time ago and who say that they missed me and that they love what I wrote, and that they wish I’ll continue writing.


I don’t know, man. I think this is the reason why I love writing fics. There are complete strangers out there who liked what I did enough to keep tabs on me even though I’m completely unreliable and disappear whenever I feel like it."

Amazingly it took me just about a month to do, which I guess isn't bad to hammer out a book in a month.  I just wish more people left feedback on it.  I've gotten a couple rave reviews and it seems it's getting a fair amount of traffic on the four sites I've posted it on and lots of repeat readers coming back to read more chapters which makes me happy, but it's always nice to actually hear what people think and it's more motivating.

750,t3_g9sk4q,FanFiction,How do I End this Plagiarism Adventure?,"So this is a long story spanning the last few years but I'm gonna do my best to condense it. There are also a bunch of different players with different perspectives on this. This is just my side of the story.

So as the result of a dumb joke gone too far, I started working on a sprawling fantasy au with a few of my other buddies in the fandom, ""K"" and ""A"". We get super into it, going nuts with the world building, doing all the things you do when you get excited creatively. This dumb joke turns into a passion project of mine that I hope to one day turn into an original published work.

A server for the writer portion of this small fandom gets made in part by one of these friends, so we migrate over. The admin seems nice at first. Insecure and childish, but nice enough. My friends and I keep talking about the AU and ideas for it in that server, but not as much as our private chat.

One day, Admin contacts me and K, who also writes for the fandom, asking us for tips on writing. We give them tactics that we've adopted, but the biggest point we hammer home to the new writer is Practice Practice Practice. The conversations, which span over the months we were friendly with Admin, were uneventful but K and I both got the impression that Admin wanted ""The Grand Secret to Writing Good"". (For the record, both K and I struggle with self esteem issues and are both extremely critical of our own works. Neither of us consider our stuff Good. Fun, but nothing exceptional)

A couple month's later, after I had posted 4 or 5 chapters of my Fantasy AU, Admin announces that they will also be doing a fantasy au. At first, I'm excited. I love AU's and love seeing what people do with the freedom of genre switching, how they thing Character A would be outside of canon. In the past, Admin's writing has been uninteresting on a conceptual level and weak in prose, so this project would be a great challenge for them to improve their work.

Then they start talking about their AU.

It's.....eerily similar to mine. (For the sake of keeping parties anonymous, I'm not going to name the ideas or link Admin's fic)

Not wanting to start drama and nonsense, I tell myself, as well as K and A, that I don't have a copyright on these ideas. It isn't like they're making money off this. Sure, it hurt that they would just take something my friends and I had worked so hard on and claim it as their own, but again, I don't have a cornered market on these ideas. There was also a part of me that knew that Admin's work wasn't a threat to my own, as their quality was ah.....lacking by comparison.

The breaking point came when Admin posted their third chapter. Despite claiming repeatedly that they hadn't read my work, their 3rd chapter was beat for beat, almost word for word an exact copy of mine. I pointed this out to Admin, who simply said what I had been saying to myself since this started. ""You don't own these ideas."" The conversation turned to Admin asking why I write the gross stuff I write (nothing super bad, just gore and Bloodborne themed stuff) and that I ""Should write about something else"". Needless to I was more than a little mad.

I talked one of the servers mod about this. Mod and another fandom writer talked to Admin about this. I don't know what went down in those conversations, but Admin began work on rewriting their AU (not to any great effect, mind you) and eventually Admin left the server entirely, handing ownership of the server to Mod.

Honestly, this whole situation just makes me tired. Part of me wonders if I had been firmer in the beginning and said what was on my mind in truth that it wouldn't have gotten this bad. Admin still writes for the fandom, I don't know the status on their AU as it hasn't been updated in a long time. I want to put neat little bow on this and be done with this but Admin refuses to talk to anyone from the server anymore. Where do I go from here?"
751,t3_g9yigh,FanFiction,Any advice?,"I have some issues with writing. It is hard to me but i really wanna try it.

752,t3_ga0gr1,FanFiction,TL:DR (want niche fic recs) No obvious internet archive of rise to power fics.,"Having been an avid reader of FanFiction for many years now my tastes have varied wildly from OC fics to absurd crossovers... however I have recently run into a problem. 
There are no archives or reading lists of fics in which a main character goes through a rise to power and then goes onto leading a country by (for example snippets of their election campaigns or context then) subsequently being voted into prime minister/president and modernising the military for conquest or diplomatically taking over Europe. Alternatively a species(preferably humans) gets absolutely curb stomped by aliens and have to lay low after their supposed ‘extinction’ till they come back with a vengeance and a taste for Xeno blood.

Out of all my time searching I have found a total of 3 or maybe even god forbid 4 fics which fulfil at least one piece of that criteria. Those being “The Leader” - a Youjo Senki/ Saga of Tanya the Evil, “A Young Girls Delinquency Record” - a Youjo Senki/ Saga of Tanya the Evil, “Emperor” - a Harry Potter AU-ish and a fic I can’t remember the name of (although I loved it) in which humans in the Mass Effect universe are hit with a super radioactive lump of metal from the Turians and they adopt the motto ’For the Innocent Dead’.
If anyone can find me any fics with as strenuous a tie as they want I will be forever grateful."

755,t3_g9ro1g,FanFiction,Regarding writing a character with PTSD...,"I'm writing a story where the MC is suddenly thrust into a loop of forced universe hopping. As in, she'll suddenly find herself in a new universe, and it goes on for 4 universes before she's back at the first universe, and it loops.

In one of those universes, she died a very gruesome death. Seeing as this is a loop, she'd be visiting that universe soon, which frankly would be very triggering.

Would it be realistic if she grows detached about it, manage to get by it, and then she crashes and breaks down later in a (to her) completely unrelated everyday thing? If not, what's a good way to tackle it? It's an important part to the story and I'd like it if it was pretty realistic."

Still, it can get discouraging when I don't really get any comments.  

But the silver lining is that my there are always around 8 people on FFN who read my most recent chapter nearly right away, within a few hours after I update.  That must mean there are people who get that update email and click right to the most recent chapter because they're following my story! It doesn't sound like a lot, but the idea that there are even a few people who have read all 70k words of my fic and still want to keep reading makes me so happy :)"
759,t3_g9k0vg,FanFiction,finding motivation for a dying fandom?,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit and on this thread so I hope it doesn't offend anyone or anything!

So there's this one fandom I always go back to (it's been a decade I think), it was pretty much the first fandom I ever wrote fanfiction for so it has special sentimental value to me.

I got popular in the fandom mostly because I wrote for a niche (in the beginning) ship that ended up getting more fans over the years. But then, as you know, life kind of catches up and I stopped writing regularly, going back to the fandom once every couple of years.

I'm back in my writing phase but the fandom is kind of dead now and it's really sad but understandable I guess. I still write for my favourite couple and all because of nostalgia, but since there aren't a lot of readers (just one or two dedicated ones who've followed me since ages ago, truly grateful for them!!), sometimes it just feels like kind of a waste of time/effort.

I guess it also goes back to the whole, do I write for only my enjoyment or is it just for eyeballs? I don't really want to fall on either end of the spectrum I guess?

Does anyone else have that problem? Where you kind of just really can't let go of a fandom, but at the same time contributing content to it doesn't seem to go anywhere."
760,t3_g9qvoo,FanFiction,a question for harry potter fanfic,"hi, i am currently in the process of writing a harry potter fanfiction that focuses a lot on the character of Severus Snape. he is my favorite character, but i prefer the movie portrayal. in my writing, i still wanted to keep his grey morals and complexity, but over time have him become a ‘nicer’ man in terms of his actions towards the students (i plan on this being a long fic in order for this development). 
my question is, as readers of hp fanfic, do you prefer reading a more book representation of snape (he was overall much more mean in the books) or the movie representation, and also what bothers you the most about how people typically write Snape? i am trying to give him more realistic representation while going through this transformation. thank you!"

Sometimes I just want to say ""thank you \[for commenting\], I'm glad you liked it!"" even 1000 times. Sometimes there's one or two people who comment on every chapter and I realize I might be filling their inbox with responses that are just like ""skfkeljgl thanks!!""  And on AO3 whatever the number of comments is, half of them are mine lol. Anyone else do that??"
764,t3_g9olhm,FanFiction,Just posted my first fanfiction after a long break!,"Around two years ago, I posted my first ever fanfiction on AO3. Surprisingly, I had a blast. Growing up, I was consistently told I had no creativity and that I was an awful writer, so I never felt comfortable enough to write out those stories that I'd daydream about. AO3 gave me a wonderful, anonymous platform to spill out all those stories I had buzzing around in my head, and for a while, I really enjoyed posting every chapter of my story.

Unfortunately, after a while, I became addicted to the statistics. Instead of thinking of every hit, every kudos, and every comment as actual, real-life people, I started obsessing over the numbers. I was still extremely grateful that anyone was reading my story at all, but I started noticing that if I didn't get any comments or didn't get as many kudos, it heavily affected my mood. Also, I found myself changing the plot of the story to what I thought people wanted to see, and long story short, it was just not healthy for me. 

So I took some time off of writing fanfiction. I tried writing for myself, but I found that I couldn't, which depressed me even further. Thus, I decided to just take a break from writing.

Today, I just posted the first chapter of my new fic after two years of taking a break from fanfiction. I still find myself wondering if people are going to even click on it, but I feel... free because I have a much healthier view of statistics and writing fanfiction in general.

Part of that is because of the wonderful community here. Up until I found this subreddit, fanfiction was something I read and wrote in secret. As a result, I ended up bottling up a lot of the joys and frustrations related to this beautiful hobby of mine. Reading people's posts and going, ""Hey, I felt that way too!"" was essential in me finding my love for writing again. So... I guess what I want to say is...

Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
765,t3_g9l7ux,FanFiction,"[Request] Fics where the MC doesn't have special abilities, but in a good way.","First of all, my preferred fandoms are Harry Potter, Star Wars and possibly Doctor Who, as in these are the properties I'm least clueless about.

I'd like to read a story where the protagonist prevails by being competent, rather than having some specific niche power that only a few people know about. 

For instance, I'm reading a fic at the moment where Harry is secretly an animagus, without training, as a result of accidental magic at the Dursleys'. I don't believe he's a Mary Sue in this story for a variety of reasons, but I still kind of want more. 

I want to see how the least enhanced Harry Potter, the one with the least raw power, would deal with a dark wizard; how the least powerful Luke Skywalker would defeat Vader and Sidious.

I hope this makes sense, suggestions much appreciated."

767,t3_g9h87y,FanFiction,What Your Comments Mean To Me...,"(I guess this fits under venting? Positive venting, maybe.)

Because I needed the inspiration, and because I am super encouraged by the reviews I have received, I have printed out the comments on my fic and pinned them up on the wall above my desk. It makes me giddy and laugh, but I also caught myself tearing up.

Here's why - growing up, most people were very encouraging of whatever I put my mind to. I loved doing art and I loved to write. However, if you had one very influential figure in your life oppose your harmless interests and try to drag you down (i.e. You're not good enough, Your work is shite, You'll fail at this like you fail at everything, yadda yadda) it impacts you harder than you realize. That was my mom to me. I closed off big time thanks to that behavior, mainly because she did things like destroy my first original work from when I was seven when I discovered I liked to make my own stories and put them in writing. It wasn't just this one instance, because I was faced with similar events through out my life. Most of everyone else in my life, both of huge influence and minor, has been very supportive (and I am so thankful for them).

But you see, having something you worked so hard on be welcomed, like a fanfiction, is such a big deal to somebody like me. Especially since one day I'm determined to have original work published. It's the words of my readers that are pushing me towards my ultimate goal, whether they realize it or not, because even the words of a stranger hits home in such precious ways. Part of what keeps me writing is knowing that there are people out there looking forward to my story, being just as excited as I am about it, and that's the best feeling ever.

So, from a fanfic author, I thank everyone who leaves those encouraging words on fanfics they read. Because you have no idea what those writers have been through and you may be one of the few encouraging them to keep pushing, and your words may wind up pinned on their wall for them to pause and re-read for that extra boost. You guys are wonderful and I love you."
768,t3_g9k2d1,FanFiction,A thought about writing silent protagonist characters from series with silent protagonists,"There's a lot of issues with trying to write silent protagonists. There really isn't much to tell about their personalities because they don't do much in game other than the actions you direct them to doing so. This is most prevalent in Ace Combat and Armored Core. I thought to myself that it was kind of awesome but weird at the same time that almost all cut scenes never actually involved the protagonist AKA the player. But when it comes to the end you are suddenly pulled in and they call out to you as if a stranger calling another for help. Then I realized... maybe this is the most effective way of utilizing a silent protagonist? Keep their intentions and viewpoints a mystery and have them purely be defined by the actions they take?

So maybe you have a main character but you never write even a single line of dialogue for them. You don't input any of their thoughts but rather it's always a third party describing them and what they do, like an outsider looking in?

I know this is mostly done in cases like those so the player can self-insert themselves into the shoes of the protagonist but I think there's also a unique air to it that makes it more than an empty vessel that readers can project themselves into. I feel like doing this, the readers would have their own interpretation of what this character is like, they'll judge and attribute their own thoughts into the character, keeping them engaged. I feel like it's kind of like a damsel in distress moment wherein the reader doesn't know the hero at all, but they know everything will be alright as long as the hero is around.

I personally find this an interesting idea to approach silent protagonists as I scour the ace combat section of fan fiction and I find that characterizations of the silent protagonists to be something I personally don't like.

Is this a good way of writing silent protagonists? Is it a bad way? Have you ever tried writing like this?"

A couple hours ago, I posted the prologue for a long fic that I've been working on for a while. As soon as I hit 'Post' I felt a little nauseous at the thought of people reading my fic--in a good way and an anxious way. Since it was my first fic, I had my expectations really low. I thought I would maybe get a few hits, no comments, and if I was lucky maybe one bookmark.

Until now, as tempting as it was, I waited a little bit to see how people were reacting to it. I am happy to say that the reaction was way better than I expected.

*50 hits, 9 kudos, 9 bookmarks, 1 subscription, and 1 comment!*

Obviously not on the same level as someone who's been posting for a while, but it made my day!

772,t3_g9fck3,FanFiction,The best kind of inspiration,"I was feeling discouraged with finishing my current long fic. Already planned out but writing it felt like a chore, and no one was rly reading it either so I put it to the side.

So today I randomly got like 5 notifs and they were all comments on the fic. Over the course of 6 currently published chapters they continued to leave like 20 comments— they’re quite good at guessing things (or I’m bad at hiding them)

And apparently they didn’t check the chapter count, and said on the latest chapter: *aaaa no cliffhanger!!*

I was about to reply saying that they made my day with all of the comments, but then they messaged me and said (paraphrased): [hi— I read [title] and uh it’s rly good- you don’t have to update if you don’t want to but I just wanted to say that I’m looking forward to it, thanks for writing it! I hope you see this]

And my heart just B U R S T

I immediately got my ass back to writing. I didn’t spend weeks on this 10k words outline for nothing!!

My writing is truly bad so I never thought I’d get something like this- it’s really boosted my inspiration, now it doesn’t really feel like a chore anymore, knowing that someone is looking forward to it &gt;.&lt;

Greetings, everyone. I come to you all seeking friendly advice about a neat little thing I'm doing as a personal side-hobby. I'm writing a story where the MC is usually seen going through a prolonged manic episode. I've done my fair share of research online regarding bipolar disorder and I even project some of my own anxieties/insecurities for good measure.

With that, however, comes the challenge of writing the character's dialogue.

What are some ways I can portray the intensity of his rapid-fire and pressured speech through words? I've tried purposefully making run-on sentences and merging words together *justlikethis* from time to time, but I feel like it's not enough. The MC's friends and people around him will occasionally remark about how they have a hard time understanding him (especially when he gets excited), but I want to express that in his dialogue. Can anyone give me some pointers? Human input, I feel, is crucial.

**P.S. I have no plans of posting this story online, in case you were wondering.**"

The two friends are close, such that they can and do over the course of a pretty short fic discuss deep, personal topics and also less personal topics. They care about each other, and they fuck. 

But no one's up in here catching feelings. 

And so I'm looking for similar fics. Just chill, casual friend sex with someone that the character trusts and feels safe with, but none of that pining or anything. Just not in the mood to read about all those emotions.

It's based off of FFXIV between a Miqo'te (Cat girl) and an Elezen who meet in a wine cellar after the Miqo'te runs away from her previous master. She's skittish, shy, and untrustworthy of newcomers. But eventually she trusts Aymeric enough. As she develops feelings for him, the (unnamed) Warrior of Light comes in. Then it becomes a love triangle to see who Aymeric loves better. 

Idk, that just sounds too cliche and predictable. What's your advice? How would you make it better?"

I write for a fandom where people are so negative, constantly bashing writers, stories, and one half of the ship. So, if I reach a milestone and come on neutral ground to express myself, then I shouldn't be judged for it. It takes time and dedication to write. No, it shouldn't be done for public approval and I am a massive advocate for writing for oneself, but like it or not, there is a tendency to be sensitive about what you write so much so that a good/bad review can make/ruin your whole day. Although we all have similar experiences on a general scale, on the specific side of it, these things are unique to each writer. 

Fanfiction is just that; fanfiction. There are no rules as to how it should be enjoyed or what pleasure people take from it. It just felt like policing to me and I realized that I'd express myself here rather than be turned off by the sub because of one post."

Main character thinking or actually talking some, changed dialogue, new dialogue, etc etc)... I just wanted to double check

Edit: Sorry... also meant to say that in I have tons of plans for it, to a point where the percentage of parts being identical to in-game would be very minimal. (Also I have no idea if the 50% is correct, I’d say at max that’s what it is, so it could be a smaller percentage)"

And man their translation was sooooo good. When I was reading it, it was almost like reading another author's take on what I wrote. The word choices were spot on. Their Chinese is definitely 100x better than mine! They captured exactly what I was going for in the fic!

822,t3_g91v2u,FanFiction,When a reader suggests a plot point change,"I posted my latest chapter of my fic last night, and received a comment asking a very good question that would potentially send my plans off the rails, if I'm not careful. 'Can Character X not marry into Family Y? They're doing more harm than good.' Family Y has a standing agreement with X: they will help him take the throne of his country, but only if he marries into the family.  My plan was to have X go through with it, despite not being happy with the marriage partner, for the sake of the throne and his people.

Then the comment happened.

If I oblige, I'll have to rewrite the story arc, and completely overhaul the second part of the story, where we follow X on his journey to retake the throne. It's not unfathomable, but I've already written my draft, and had all my loose ends  nicely tied up.  Family Y, who has a lot of political standing in the country in question, would be very angry if X reneged on the betrothal. They could join their forces with X's rival for the throne. It \*could\* be an excellent source of conflict, but would it be worth the rewrite? I'm not averse to rewrites, and welcome all input, but this is a game changer.

Have you ever had a comment like this? And, if so, how did you approach it? I don't want to discourage this reader by a flatout 'no,' but they do pose an interesting question. One I'm really tempted to explore and possibly incorporate.

Thank you in advance. Your input is appreciated! :)"
823,t3_g9eirw,FanFiction,Looking for a bit from what I think was a Mass Effect crossover,"I can’t remember what the actual overall plot or whatever was, but I remember one section that I want to revisit because I’m not sure if I’m starting to make things up in my memory. There was an alien race that I think was part of some sort of coalition with the humans, and they develop a anti nuke field of some sort. There is a line something like, “they only ever dropped a nuke once, and not because they found a better weapon. Rather they developed an anti nuke device”. This comes up when I think the Turians nuke one of the human/alien worlds in a first contact mess, but the nuke doesn’t go off and just falls harmlessly to the ground. 
Sorry if this isn’t the right way to tag this, but I would definitely appreciate if anyone remembers what this is from."

825,t3_g8zmqh,FanFiction,Britpick advice re toilets,"
In American English a bathroom is used as a euphemism for toilet.

In British English a bathroom is a room with a bath or shower.

If you were in a restaurant you would not expect to find a 'bathroom' only a toilet.

Some younger British people, probably due to influences from American movies and series are using 'bathroom' for 'toilet' but standard usage is still toilet.

Now I've just come from reading a fic which used 'loo' throughout. I think they got confused and now even when the character is going for a bath or shower they are going to the 'loo'. Not correct. 

You have/take a bath or shower in the bathroom. 


Bodily functions involving the urinary tract and colon have always been shrouded in euphemism. There is also a class distinction in British English.

Standard English = toilet.

Upper class = toilet/lavatory

Middle class/ 'ordinary' = toilet/lavatory/WC

Informal = lav; loo; john; shanks; bog; see a man about a dog; spend a penny; going for a piss; visiting the smallest room."

828,t3_g9ahts,FanFiction,Structural Editing - Split Long First Chapter?,"I'm almost done with my WIP and I found while looking at the word counts for each chapter that my first chapter is about twice as long as the average word count for my other chapters (average chapter length, 1162; first chapter, 2073). While I understand that chapters are as long as they need to be, there are a few complications. My main inciting incident (in fact the hook that I'm putting in the summary) is in the second half of the chapter, which would then become chapter two, and the first chapter would seem like an irrelevant action scene put at the beginning of the fic to get people excited (though there's a lot of important exposition regarding the central mystery of the fic). 

In original fiction, contemporary or literary, that would be fine. What I'm worried about is if it will look like a bait-and-switch until I post the second chapter. On the other hand, I'm worried that if I post the extra-long chapter, people will expect the rest of the chapters to be of similar length when they are very much not. I guess my questions are: 

1) Do you mind when a fic's summary isn't necessarily reflective of the first chapter?  
2) Do you mind if a fic has chapters of wildly varying length?  
3) Am I way overthinking this?"
829,t3_g8z3k4,FanFiction,Let's talk about the Soulmate AU fanfictions?,"So, Soulmate AU-fics are some of the most popular kinds of fanfictions out there where everyone has a partner who is their ""soulmate"" and who should be their perfect match.

I've honestly got mixed feelings about this as sometimes I like it but other times not.

While I often find it cute when characters are simply wondering who their soulmate is, end up meeting them and actually try to get to know each other, I don't really like how sometimes characters act like their only purpose in life is meeting their soulmate and upon meeting straight up kiss them without any thought.

I say again, it really depends on how it's written on how I like it.

Also, while the Soulmate AU is popular, I've seen tons of ""types"" where you all find or connect to your soulmate in a different way.

So far I've seen Soulmate Fics where soulmates:

\- Have matching tattoos/birthmarks

\- Have timers on their wrist counting down till they meet their soulmate

\- Feel each other's pain

\- Grow flowers from their bodies on places when their soulmate for injured

\- Start seeing color for the first time upon seeing their soulmate

\- can hear/see what the other is hearing/seeing if they concentrate hard enough

\- Have a ""string of fate"" connected that they can follow to each other

\- Glow only for each other to see before meeting

\- can give each other their own life-force

Am I missing something?

Anyone else have an opinion on this or know if a popular Soulmate AU that I forgot?"

For everyone I know who reads fanfic, there are those special works that are so unforgettable you don't need a bookmark to find it. 

Here is to all those beautiful fanfictions that will always be in the back of our mind. To the works that feel so satisfying when you finish them, for when you sit back you understand the love that went into them. Here is to those bittersweet moments when you finish reading an epic fic, simultaneously yearning for more of that world and enjoying the arc that has completed.

Fanfic is a beautiful fruition of love from those who write it, those who read it, and those who created the original media basis. To me, this culmination of dedication means that fanfiction can touch the soul and have impact in a way that is so unique and so powerful."

I haven’t posted any E-rated fics on my main account, but my T-rated fics get way more hits than my M- and G-rated ones. 

In general, I just don’t see a lot of M-rated fics, so I come across T-rated fics that have full on sex scenes and E-rated fics that have only passing mentions of sex. My theory is the people who don’t want to read smut tend to go for T-rated fics and people who do want it go for E-rated fics.

Does anyone who posts fics of all ratings have any thoughts on this? Are G- and M-rated fics doomed to lower visibility?

And I don’t know how this applies to violence because I don’t read a lot of violent fics, so I’d be curious what people’s thoughts are? In my experience, fics with war/gunfight violence (in other words, gritty but not lose-sleep-over-it disturbing) do tend to use the M rating."

839,t3_g8tp2k,FanFiction,How Fanfiction changed my (previously a non-English speaking immigrant) life,"As [my FFN account](https://www.fanfiction.net/~nobody426) is turning 10 in two months, I have been reflecting upon how this space -- created by fans, for fans -- had changed my life completely (beyond bounds of my imagination).

I was a lonely kid. Before I turned 13 I've moved 6 times in my life, across three regions that speak vastly different languages. I didn't have friends because social media wasn't really quite a thing, yet. When I was 12 years old, I nearly couldn't speak any English. I was that kid whose mom tried buying her a book in English (it was *The Prisoner of Azkaban*; my mom didn't speak English, either, and didn't know that it was the third in a series) and couldn't even make it past the second page because 11yo me couldn't figure out what ""damn"" means on Page 3 and I became too discouraged to continue.

Then came the *Percy Jackson and the Olympians* series, and my world *changed*.

I found the book on my sister's (she was in second grade) Scholastic book fair handout and I was hooked by the concept of a boy my age, half-human half-god, having to battle both the monster *and* the mortal bullies in his every day life. *I was dealing with a lot of bullies*, I thought, *maybe I could relate to this.* I was trying to learn English, anyway.

I couldn't afford the books but I borrowed it from my only friend, then, and oh my gods, the book was *amazing*. I mean, it was a really difficult read for me. Most kids probably had the ability to read it at half of my age then, but I enjoyed the hell out of it, just reading it side by side with a dictionary. I got 0 references of anything that was even remotely related to American culture but that was fine. I loved the story and I wanted more.

So I finished the second book through the fourth book, and my friend mournfully told me that she didn't have the fifth. My parents couldn't afford the book, so I started to look for ways I can read more of the series and *wow*, what a *world* I have discovered.

I waited until I was 13 like a ""good kid"" (FFN said I had to be 13 and I was terrified of breaching the rules) and I started writing my version of how that story can go. That *changed my life*.

Essentially, I was inspired to learn English at a quicker pace and participated more avidly in class, which helped me improve my English skills in both reading, writing, and speaking. I read for hours every day, but I wrote more. That gave me the confidence to be more involved in everything I did in my life, such as school extracurricular.

Years later, when I was working on my college applications, I used the approach I did with my stories to plan, write, and edit, and I did the same with my scholarship essays. I ended up being awarded a full-ride scholarship to one of the top schools in the country, and that completely changed me (and my family's) future socioeconomic outlook. I've been beyond grateful.

Prior to 2020, it had been four and a half years since I was active on FFN and *one day*, I got a ping from one of my readers. They wanted to check-in with me. I joined their Discord and that dragged me back into my daily cadence of writing. That has been a saving grace for me this quarantine, and I am so happy to be back. 

Now, I just want to take a moment and really, *really* reflect upon how lucky I had been to have stumbled upon Fanfiction and be a part of this enormous global community. Thank you."
840,t3_g9baki,FanFiction,"Lost Kingdom Hearts Fanfic, Addicted by spellbounddreamer?","Hello all first time poster but need help.
Im looking for a lost Fanfic,

It was a set of 3 fics that all began with with A, two of which were Addicted and Angel. They were split between Sora, Riku and Kairi. 
I think the author was spellbound dreamer or iwasoncespellbound.

With Sora being a bottom rung loser and his ascent to being popular and confident
Kairi being the pretty new girl and it being like a mean girls type story with tragic history. 
And finally Riku being the cold bully that had an awful childhood and is merciless to Sora. 

It had a strong theme of music with each character being able to sing and being part of the school play 

It was a high school type setting that had characters from Disney and Final Fantasy in different roles. Like sephiroth as rikus strict father but also the theatre group which was a main plot in all the fics. 

Also Vanitas as soras cooler slacker half brother and ventus being soras twin. And Aerith and Cloud being soras divorced parents etc. 
 
I've been lookin on and off for a few years I got desperate and made an account after seeing a similar post on this thread. Anyway thanks 😂😁"
841,t3_g9b03s,FanFiction,When readers misinterpret what happened,"So I basically had 3 characters that were opposed to working together, but they came right in the end and passed the objective. Great.


So, some of them tried to sabotage each other because they misunderstood the objective. Later on they get into a fight which is caused a misunderstanding. 


So all 3 characters have trauma from their past that colours how they deal with friendship and all that. I made that so explicitly clear.


Somehow, my MC is the only one not getting heat for it though. Like wtf? You don't compare trauma obviously, but all 3 of them had it pretty bad in the past and then a few reviewers just brushed aside all of the trauma the other two had and instead shat all over them for how they treated the MC.


That's not the point of the story!!!


Dude, read the fucking story. No one is in the right, damnit. They all have issues they need to work through to work together properly even the people that are seemingly in the right when in reality they were just as bad.

Please, no one jump down my throat for writing fanfic about people who have been dead for 200 years. Also, *please* don't hassle the people who did this. I already posted a comment asking what the heck they think they are doing. I just wanted to share because it's very funny.

I wonder if the rest of the plot got in the way for them? Or if they just wanted easy content? It's weird because I only recently posted content for this tag too.

It blows my mind that this is the first time I've ever seen my stuff yanked. I'm just baffled.

They mystery deepens! I realized I should check the rest of their profile and I found more of my writing in their fics, once again just copied and pasted with no credit. Left another comment. 

Their most recent fic is dedicated to me, though. ""*For XXX, \[Me\] they inspired me to begin writing on here!*""

I was looking for some fics to read on Ao3 **(because having 3 pages of 'Saved for Later' fics isn't enough😖)** and saw one that looked somewhat interesting. In the author's notes, it said that the original writer **(OW)** had deleted the fic, but they had it saved, so they were reuploading it for us.

I wasn't gonna say anything, mainly because it's not my place to do so, but is that ethical? Maybe the OW deleted it because they're absolutely not interested in having it online anymore. The fact that it was deleted rather than orphaned, means they were ***really*** done with it, so why post it again? They didn't mention having permission, just that they happened to have the pdf and were going to keep posting the chapters. 

Is that common, and what do you think about this? Again, I'm not going to say anything, I'm just curious about everyone's opinions.

**Update: It has been taken down! Not sure if their conscience made them delete or if it was reported, but it's gone.**

Based on the comments, I'll report next time. I felt like I'd be overstepping by doing so, but I realized that it's the right thing to do."

849,t3_g954xm,FanFiction,Am I going to far down the rabbit hole,"So I have a tendency when doing research to basically get so interested in what I'm researching I lose sight over what I was originally writing. For example the biggest rabbit hole I've ever gone done was Special operations, long story short was writing about republic commandos. Went so far down the rabbit whole I've accumulated a vast knowledge of declassified military information of numerous countries spec ops units both tier one and tier two, and am now working on a academic paper about the development of irregular warfare concerning two Roman dudes, since spec ops is a method of irregular warfare so in a quest to understand the principles of it I found myself in ancient Rome all of a sudden. And have just now after 8 years gotten back around to the republic commando story I was originally working because of social distancing.

That said I'm now moving in to the 40k universe I want to start with a story about a group of Tempestus Scions, an inquisitor, a few cadian shock troopers, and maybe a sister of battle who got thrown into the starwars galaxy and became mercenaries. So start with a familiar setting with new and different characters. The thing is though there's enough 40k lore that this same rabbit hole could once again form.

This is the first story I'm writing where I don't care much for the plot and I'm just doing it for fun. That's why I've got 7 chapters written in 2 weeks.

I remember Tadashi and Hiccup are a couple, Hiccup is in a gang, none of Tadashi's friends like hiccup, Tadashi has a night fury tattoo. Also I think that at one point Hiccup had tortured GoGo, but not as much as he could have and got his leg shattered for it. I also think Hiccup is a tech genius who built robot dragons and funds prosthetics.

859,t3_g8vkks,FanFiction,Anyone else love reading great fics for fandoms you're not in or are just barely on the fringes of? What are those fics?,"So I have basically one fandom: Les Miserables. I love the original Brick, I love the musical and many other adaptations, I love academic Hugo scholarship, and I love reading modern Amis AUs. But, I read loads of fic outside that fandom. Very often, I find that my very best fic-reading experiences happen when:

\-I only have the basic familiarity with plot and characters that comes with cultural osmosis/seeing lots of gifs/seeing like 1 or 2 films in a franchise  
\-the fandom is large and active, producing a lot of material and elevating a few great works to ""classic"" status so I can get straight to the excellence

When that happens, I can get engrossed in the emotional lushness of good fic, without feeling the inevitable tensions/inconsistencies between the characters and their originals. The fic gets to stand alone, and it CAN because it's well written and the writer has made the characters their own. I've had this reading experience often enough that I now want to deliberately seek it out.

The best examples of this, I think, have been owlet's ""Infinite Coffee and Protection Detail"" and spitandvinegar's ""Ain't No Grave (Can Keep My Body Down)"" from MCU fandom; and hollycomb's ""Children, Wake Up"" series, from Star Wars sequels fandom. I have seen very little of the source media and didn't like what I did see all that much, but these fanworks are truly great literature.

I wanna have that reading experience again! Anyone else have a favorite fic for a fandom you're not/barely in? I would like to read that favorite!"

Back then, either you posted your stories to your Geocities site (or Angelfire, or some other personal website), or FF.net. as I'm terrible at HTML, I preferred FF.net. 

Nowadays, I don't use a computer for browsing anymore, I pretty much use my phone for most things, as it's more convenient. Heck, I even recently got back into writing after a 9 year hiatus, and found that typing everything on my phone is working better for me.

So I wondered how do people like to read fanfiction these days? The FF.net website hasn't really changed in a decade, but it now has a mobile app which I really like. I like the various choices for fonts, I love dark mode, and the robotic auto reader is awesome for listening in the car. About the only thing it doesn't do is PMs don't seem ro work properly. 

AO3 is a newer site (at least to me), and while I wish I could make it do dark mode (if I can, someone please tell me how!), I do appreciate the option do have all chapters on a single page while scrolling, the review reply feature is much better, and the download to MOBI format means I can read on my Kindle, something I *really* like for longer fics.

The girl slips A the potion and they become infatuated with B for half a day. Before this, A and B, are friends who bicker as their humor, and get along but sometimes still fight like its their first year, of course there's underlying pining. The two are basically in a friendship that used to be kind of enemies, but more of a rivals.

 I've already written the scene where B makes the potion and I want to open up the second part of my one-shot with a scene of the day before and then when it's the next morning the love potion takes effect. I'm planning on it being really awkward for B because, y'know, they're friends with underlying pining. I'd just like some advice on writing hidden feelings or how B might react to A suddenly being all clingy and lovey. 

After the potion also wears off I want to have some time where they avoid each other from that and it's tense in their friend circle, also a to that.

I am a beta reader for another fic writer in my medium-sized fandom, and I’m also a fic writer myself. I ended up being her beta because I am a HUGE fan of her work, so I reached out to her eagerly when I found her on Tumblr. For awhile, it was working out great. She is very nice and extremely open to my suggestions and concrit, while also being supportive of my work. Really she has done nothing wrong which is what makes me feel even worse.

I guess I didn’t realize how hard it would be not to compare myself to her when we started posting longfics at the same time? Before, I never compared because I wasn’t so intimately invested in her success. But now... I knew she was popular (she has a beloved top page fic) but I feel like I’m suddenly always bombarded with HOW popular she is. 

Our fics are about the same length and our chapters are both posted weekly... but she has 4x my kudos. My last chapter got 10 comments, hers got 37. She gets anon messages on Tumblr from other readers asking her to break down her writing process and sending her “I LOVE YOU” notes on a daily to weekly basis. I’ve gotten maybe a handful in my five years on the site. I’m in a fandom discord where people get more excited to meet me when they find out I’m her beta (“omg I’m so jealous you get to work with [author]!!!!”) and sometimes it’s a lot. It makes me wish that I was the one getting that kind of attention, that people liked my work that much, and I even resent her work a little which sucks because I love it! I get why people love it. I just feel like Salieri.

If I could work on her fic in a vacuum, I’d be thrilled. But right now I can’t help but compare our responses. It’s ruining the experience for me and I’m not sure how to get over it/myself. I knew she was both a genuinely talented (I’d even say brilliant) writer and a BNF when I started working with her, but I didn’t anticipate this reaction in myself."

Right now I have a folder named ""Quarantine Reads"" that I have to go back to the webpage to left kudos and comments. Let me know how do you choose to read fics!"
880,t3_g8jac6,FanFiction,Maybe your fic is not that interesting,"(I belong in the Misleading Title Hall of Shame, I know)


Today I was scrolling down on Facebook, when I came across a post from a page I follow, saying ""if you have good spelling and writing and still don't have many readings, maybe your fic is just not interesting"", and people went WILD on the comments.


I read things like 
•""it's because of the lemon"", 
•""my fics are not focused on shipping characters, and fics written by 12yo girls are more popular"", 
•""my ship is too 'crack'"", 
•""there aren't readers who aprecciate a good plot, they just read bad written lemon"", 
•""or is not too cliché"", 
•""or my fandom is dead"", 
•""or maybe because you don't include smut in the first three chapters"", 
•""or people are lazy and they just like lemon"", 
•""actually, it's cause' it doesn't have the typical romantic clichés"", 
•""it is not that my fic isn't interesting, but the topic is not popular"", 
•""or the fandom is really small, genius"".


I was like..., geez, really?


The lack of self awareness left me astounded. We don't need to have an incredibly high IQ to know that the vast majority of fanfics are just not that great. That is the truth. 90% of the fanfickers would be eaten alive by the critics if their works were published as originals (not that some original books aren't trash).
There are some brilliant writers out there, yes, but we are not part of them.
I am not, and probably you, reading this now, are not one of them either.


Why it is so hard to accept?
We are not that great. Maybe our works are not that interesting.


We write for fun. We are not masters, we are not going to win the Pullitzer for our 30,000 words short fics. And that's okay.


Love your readers, comments, kudos, etc. But also accept that probably you are not that great. It is going to help you sleep at night.

I'm not sure what's worse: Getting a lot of hits but no engagement (kudos, feedback etc.), or Not getting much views/hits at all. What do you think?

I have this recently finished story that's always gotten hits, but then nothing comes from most of them. So I'm thinking that they are a lot of first chapter clickers and ditchers, if that makes sense. And then I feel bad because I'm like ""something is missing from my story, what is it? how do I make it better?"" 

But the thing is...you just never really know what a reader is gonna like. But I always wonder why so many people click on/hit the story but then leave. 

This story is also about grief/hurt/comfort, not something I typically write, and I feel that my writing style can sometimes lean towards more telly-less-showy. So I understand that there may be a lot of factors/things wrong with the story. But I'm still proud of what I did do. It's just frustrating to not know why the story doesn't do well.

I’m noticing a trend in all two fanfictions I have been writing

There is a distinct tendency for a Silly Fun Idea to turn into Lots Of Plot really quickly. For example, my deeply fuckin’ silly “What if Geralt of Rivia and Jareth the Goblin King met up somehow?” is becoming weirdly in-depth fic about how the Labyrinth functions and I have had to do research by digging up my old Goblins of the Labyrinth book by Brian Froud and Terry Jones and cross-referencing with the comics to see if there’s any cool lore I feel like using. 

it is possible I take this too seriously. Fuck it, it’s fun.

I'm even thinking of posting two chapters at once to draw less attention to it, but that feels like a very cheap, sneaky thing to do, and it'd probably be obvious what I'm trying to do, I imagine.

If you've been in a similar situation, what did you do? Force yourself to revise the chapter until it was up to your standards? Just post and hope for the best? Completely change the trajectory of it? Not post it at all and skip it in the story? What do you think?

895,t3_g8otvn,FanFiction,Writing scenes with multiple characters,"I'm currently writing in two different fandoms that both have large numbers of characters. In one fandom, a large number of scenes will have a minimum of three characters, and the other fandom will frequently have scenes with six or more. I do obviously have scenes where it's just two characters (as all the fics I'm speaking of are OC/Canon Character so I've got a nice balance of the two main characters bonding with the multiple character scenes) but I tend to struggle in scenes where I have to have multiple characters. It more boils down to dialogue and actions. I love dialogue and I do a good job of keeping the characters in-character while they're actually speaking, but dialogue tags start to stress me out when I get to scenes with 3 or more characters because I don't want to sound redundant. I don't want to say ""said"" too many times, or add in unnecessary actions with dialogue tags to avoid that. I do try to find alternatives to said (announced, offered, countered, argued, sighed, etc.) but I still find myself stressed out by dialogue tags when I have multiple characters in one scene, since it gets harder to write parts of the conversation without dialogue tags (like you can when there are only 2 characters and the reader can better follow who is speaking without a tag stating it).

So I'm wondering: what are some tips or tricks that you use when writing and describing dialogue when you have 3 or more characters in a scene?"

Plot: Stiles went missing and the pack had low key given up, but they go to meet with the alpha of a neighboring pack and lo and behold, there is stiles. I think he’s called Red by the asshole alpha who claims they are mates and Derek is like tf. Basically the dude is magically controlling Stiles to make him his hit man and clean up crew. The controls are runes around his neck/arms I think. Eventually it turns out it was Kate who originally collared him. At one point someone brings in a woman who is a sniper (?) to kill Kate. Eventually stiles gets out of it and he and Derek get together and it ends with the pack sitting around a fire telling monster stories including one about 'Red' who was actually Stiles and he is uncomfortable but knows it will get better.

No idea if this is legit. At one point long ago, I applied for ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" which I think is Disney administered, but went no further because the site wanted sensitive information. It may have something to do with that.

I haven't gotten such an email before. No idea if this is in connection with my writing or not. Regardless, I don't plan to take any further action or click on any links in the message. If anyone has different thoughts on the matter, would be interested to hear feedback."

Should Ao3 be allowed to ask for donations during this cruical moment in our lives?

909,t3_g82tus,FanFiction,"""The Poor Mary/Gary Sue Victim"" Complex","Hey everybody! 

My title's probably a bit confusing, but I promise to elaborate. I'm sure many of you have ecountered what I'm referring to- fics that feature a victimized MC who's hated and misunderstood by all of those around him/her, when in reality they're a perfect angel with zero flaws™ ! 

I just dropped a fic that was otherwise very well written- it had a great deal of world building, the grammar and writing style was top notch stuff. But dear lord, the sheer level of character worship/victimization was through the roof. Despite having a horrible reputation and being hated by everybody in the town he lived in (for some inexplicable reason), every single person that came into contact with MC would have sudden revelations and go on multiple, long-winded monologues about how unbelievably amazing/perfect/kind/selfless/intelligent MC was. How utterly misunderstood this poor, poor man was and how terribly foolish they all had been to misjudge him. I had to stop after like the tenth chapter of the same point being driven home over and over again.

Don't get me wrong, I love some good old angst as much as the next person- but give your main character some flaws and nuance! No single person does everything right, is kind all of the time, or always has the right thing to say. Make your MC a bit of an asshole sometimes, a bit foolish. It makes them more relatable, and opens the door to character development. It also really doesn't help when a writer goes about elevating one character by bashing others into infinity and beyond. 

Disclaimer: I just want to point out that I'm an avid fanfic reader *and* writer. I'm very well aware of how much work goes into writing fics and that writers are providing a service for free, and am always appreciative. I never leave impolite comments on writers' fics and live by the policy of ""don't like, don't read.""  Having said that, I just wanted to let off some steam and hope I haven't upset anyone over it. I know my writing isn't perfect either, far from it."
910,t3_g8r1cn,FanFiction,Frozen in the Homestretch.,"So I've been writing fanfiction for a while, just my own small (or mid-sized fandom). I'm not a fantastically great writer, but at least mid tier. My usual niche is angst (like, super angst, multiple emotional character deaths), but recently been branching into other, significantly fluffier realms.

Anyways, I'm the type of writer that tends to get ideas that invade and dominate my thinking that I can't write other stuff until they are out of head and on the page. One such idea, is nearly complete. I am literally 2-6 sentences from it being done, but nothing I am writing is good enough. I am 137 hours into this piece (and two days of trying to write the last bit), and am absolutely tired of it. But any attempts to work on my other stuff fails, including my main work which is only half way.

I know what needs to be there, I can't seem to find adequate phrasing for it.

So, any tricks y'all have in getting the inspiration to push you the last little way? I have tried all my usual tricks, but after a month, they aren't working."
911,t3_g8drxp,FanFiction,I found a handful of fanfics I wrote as a young teenager but never published online,"I’m considering posting them, even though they do not particularly represent me as a writer anymore and even include some very silly “Author’s Notes” and some dark themes mixed with not-great writing. 

But I found myself intrigued by these writing examples from my younger years. For one, they capture a rare look into my passions and values at that age. Things I never realized about myself were evident in those little stories. These are stories I *wouldn’t* write now, which makes them hard to rewrite or edit, so that option, while it has potential, is a difficult road. I wrote stories that broke ethical standards and stories that parroted ideas I no longer believe in. 

I’m considering posting them somewhere, almost as a tribute to young writers. I did post some at that age and there *was* an audience for them, and that intrigues me. But I’m facing a dilemma here. 

I don’t want to *spread* bad ideas I used to hold. In some ways I am proud that little Maria didn’t post these stories. I think she knew in her heart that they were controversial, and bad, even though they clawed at her mind. I remember the compulsion to write the stories that formed in my mind. 

I also don’t like posting anything *unfinished*, and many of them are, and would be nearly impossible to finish now simply because at the time the worlds were not complete. Old Percy Jackson stories from 2007, for example, would not include anything cannon after The Sea of Monsters, possibly not after The Titans Curse, but I’m not totally sure what I had read to by then or what my “idea” was leading to. Moreover, I can’t finish some of them simply because A) I don’t know where I was going with the story and B) I’m not the same person and can’t mentally place myself back there to continue these stories organically, although it might not be a bad writing exercise to do so. 

One of these stories is *very* interesting to me as it is a Harry Potter “next generation” fiction written in 2009 and has some interesting similarities to Cursed Child. No time turner action, although that did show up in other little Harry Potter fan-fictions I wrote, but I found it funny that the story elements I imagined up, which I did believe were a bit too wild for the original work to play with, are included in a half-canon play. I’m really leaning towards posting the chapters I wrote of that one. 


Any recommendations here? Should I post them on a different site if I post them at all? Should I make an attempt to rewrite each one and then post the original?

Edit: I think I’ve made a decision. I’m going to post these on a separate ff.net account from my main, but post the “revamped” versions on my main if I choose to write them."
912,t3_g8gqxr,FanFiction,Any tips for an Ao3'er who is about to start crossposting to ff.net?,"As the title says, I decided to take the plunge and start crossposting my current WIP longfic that I've been writing for Ao3 over to fanfiction.net. I'm planning to upload my first two chapters today, and then add another chapter 1/week until I'm caught up to Ao3.

I was originally just going to ""wing it"" and figure things out as I go, but now that I've realized I have a 12 hour waiting period before I can click ""new story"", I figured it couldn't hurt to seek out tips during this time. So do any fanfiction.net vets have any advice for a newbie author, especially those of you who are familiar with both platforms? Any major differences I should keep an eye out for?

121,000 words! Only 62,000 of them are actually published (the rest still being edited) but even so, even my published words is longer than my next longest piece of writing. It's incredible that I've written so much for one story. I can't believe it, and sometimes I'm haunted about how this story will never end and I'm going to still be working on it on my death but, but honestly, it's kind of cool. I broke 100k!"

I just marked it gen because I couldn’t think of any other way to do it. However, I think the gen label might be affecting the level of traffic on the story, and not in a good way. I think a lot of people are assuming there are no ships, not that it can be any ship. Would it be appropriate, in this case, to tag it with the different ship options as long as I’m clear that it’s a “choose your own ship” type of thing? Or should I leave it marked as gen?

I’ve been updating it regularly again, and in the beginning I got comments from a couple of people on the site where it was originally posted years ago, who said they were happy I was updating again, which absolutely thrilled me.

I never used AO3/FFN until last year, and I migrated my fic there and have been updating there as well for several months now. In the past two weeks I’ve received three *more* comments out of the blue from readers saying they remembered my fic from the old site and were happy to run across it on AO3 and read the updates, and they left such lovely compliments about it!

I hope this doesn’t sound like an insufferable humblebrag, but I was genuinely so shocked because as much as I love my fic, I just didn’t expect that it was all that consequential, especially since it’s a huge fandom. First of all, what were the odds they’d even run across my fic; second, the fact that they’d even remember; and third, the fact that they bothered to comment when they didn’t have to; all of it just has me over the moon. I actually cried when I read the comment I got last night.

I just needed to share. &lt;3"
922,t3_g8ix5e,FanFiction,"Fandom Request, Projects Still In Development","Hello, I am here to ask a question.

You see, I am currently working on a cartoon animated series project about a boy with a condition of his look and his supernatural ability. This is created by me J-547, and I am currently the only person that is developing this project with future short animations, drawings, designs, backgrounds, etc.

Now I know I hear about fanfiction and how the fandom can be creative and make stories around their favorite cartoons, movies, and anime. I also heard that you could request to FanFiction.Net to make a fandom based on a topic that hasn't been known on FF yet.

With my project still in the works, is it okay to request a fandom for my project? So I can see how people know this topic and writing their own stories about what could happen or what can be different. Just something to learn from for the future when I am finished with my goal.

If not, I will be nice and give you an option as to why I can not. (Which I think is most likely, but I want to make sure.)"
923,t3_g8momh,FanFiction,Goblin Slayer/RWBY fiction,"Sooo, I have odd tastes and niche group types when it comes to FF. I was debating about writing on because I have been TRYING to find and read GS fiction and a fair amount of RWBY fiction lately (Jaune mostly the hero/main lover interest haram style to include Glynda)...as I said, niche/odd...well i had a thought of doing a fiction and doing a cross over, using the RWBY characters as the GS world characters, Jaune as GS, Ruby as Priestess, Glynda as Sword Maiden....but that’s as far as I have gotten, same with the enemies, Grimm are fairly easy as they could be what all the other characters take on and Jaune is “Grimlin/Grimmlin Slayer” which Grimlins could be the primary causes of hate/depression in the world around them. I’m trying to get help with combining these 2 in tying these  characters as who would be who AND building the world a bit, any help if much appreciated for a different taste!"
924,t3_g8b3xb,FanFiction,AO3 Question: Is there a way to look at a “popular view” of fandoms per each media type like FF.net?,"I’m an old hand at fanfiction, but reasonably new to AO3. I’ve been using FF.net for years, and the site is formatted where you can see the “popular”/high population fandoms for each media category (movies, books, video games, TV, etc). I enjoy being able to look at that view, as it allows me the ability to explore lesser known fandoms or extremely popular ones very easily.

On AO3, while they do have a smaller version of that view via “All Fandoms,” I was curiously if they also have a way of formatting a search so you can see fandoms via popularity/population per each media category? Or perhaps by way of filters? Because when faced with the insane archive listings sorted via alphabet, it makes me kinda wish I had FF.net’s categories.

... or should I just stick to FF.net for that kind of browsing?"
925,t3_g8g5p4,FanFiction,Done my first fanfic,"Finished my first fanfic (but not really finished, just done the first chapter and half of second chapter) but idk if I should post the link here, cause I don't want to risk getting banned"
926,t3_g8jluo,FanFiction,Could an author publish someone’s fanfiction about their book/movie/etc.?,"Since fanfiction cannot legally be published without the consent of the author (or if the author’s works have passed into the public domain somehow), could the original author take a fanfiction and publish it themselves? For example, could J.K. Rowling nab Harry Potter fanfics off the internet and publish them? Make movies out of them?

EDIT: To clarify, I’m asking if she could do so without any consent from the original writer, no crediting, no profits for the writer. Just copy and paste off the internet and published with just JK’s name on it.

EDIT 2: I think I may have found something that could contribute to a more definitive answer: “The case of Anderson v. Stallone is instructive, not because it involves a work of fan fiction but because it is perhaps the closest parallel to it. Anderson wrote a film treatment for a sequel to the Rocky series. Anderson presented his treatment to the film studio, and it allegedly became the basis for Rocky IV. The studio did not compensate Anderson for his script or acknowledge him as a co-author. The court determined that Anderson's script was an unauthorized derivative work, declining to determine the question of substantial similarity because it was unnecessary: Anderson concededly lifted the characters from the prior Rocky movies and built his story on their past experiences. Because the treatment exhibited ""literal similarity"" and had not been authorized by the Rocky copyright holders, it was an unauthorized derivative work that infringed on the holder's copyrights.” This is nowhere near a perfect comparison, but it makes me think the courts would side with JK on this one."
927,t3_g8bjqy,FanFiction,Letting people's preferences decide what I update,"I've overcome my stats obsession and gotten back into writing, and I feel ready to continue my almost-finished, very angsty-fluffy and very dear to me fic of 70k words (three chapters to go) and I'm buzzing with inspiration and already half finished with the next chapter. Problem is, it's pretty much at a standstill feedback wise, because the subject matter is quite heavy, even though I know there's at least one reader who's excited for the next update, but I keep getting kudos for two of my other fics,  a smutty oneshot, plus a light hearted oneshot.

930,t3_g7xpzj,FanFiction,Popular fandoms vs unknown fandoms,"I have noticed that when people talk about fandoms, ships, fanfics or want recommendations for a popular fandom they talk about it like everyone else knows all the details. Not everyone is familiar with the most popular fandoms. I don't want to offend anyone, just sometimes it comes off as annoying. At the same time the people that are in small or unpopular fandoms either don't want to say what fandom they write for or have to explain.

This is just an observation and an opinion, I hope no one gets offended. But sometimes it's like there are more important and less important fandoms.

EDIT: Also people that mention fandoms by abbreviation and not a full name. It's like everyone knows what they are talking about. I have to google often when that happens."
931,t3_g8b4cb,FanFiction,Do you delete stories you know you'll never finish?,"I have about 15 stories on my A03. Only one of them is unfinished. It really bothers my perfectionism to know it's there in the sea of finished stuff. I've been meaning to return to it for months now, but I've finished like 5 long fics since then. I've accepted I don't plan to finish it. 

But, what bothers me more is I know people are clicking on it, reading through 10,000+ words to reach a dead end with no resolution. So, I've been debating deleting it so I don't waste people's time. I have the story saved in my docs, so if sometime I do choose to finish it I can just repost it.

Not saying that I'll write nothing but smut now, but at least it won't be this big, scary thing that I avoid anymore.

First fic with a regular battle scene, humans vs. humans. First fic where I’ve planned to include a really *unpopular* ship because I like it, and first fic where I nope’d a really *popular* ship because of its unhealthy bothers-me-ness.

934,t3_g8id75,FanFiction,Looking for the fic that got me into fanfiction - need help,"This fic got me into fanfiction, and it wasn't even a ship I knew, or characters I knew. I'm having trouble finding it. 

It was on AO3 last I saw it. So basically a charles xavier / Erik lehnsherr (professor x /magneto) fic, in a D/S setting. It was a long fic, slow burn, rated explicit and I think fairly popular. 

Basic plot - Charles takes in a young (late teens? So probably tagged underage) Erik, for what reason I can't remember (something to do with a court case?)  It turns out Erik is a really powerful dom (this fic had it as levels, like D-4, S-8 to denote how powerful). Charles is a sub and begins to fall for Erik without his knowledge. They end up getting together, but Charles hates himself for it. Can't remember where it goes after that.

I can give more details if you ask, probably but I can't think of them off the top of my head. I've tried searching by the ship and Dom/Sub but haven't found it. I'd really like to read it again, can anyone help?"
935,t3_g847yc,FanFiction,What's your origin story?,"I was talking with my friend today about fanfiction, and made some comment about my very first fic being inspired by another one I'd read. She corrected me and said, ""No, remember the notebook we had in school?""  And then I suddenly remembered that my *actual* first ever attempt at fanfiction was our hilariously bad self-insert Doctor Who story.

Anyway, it got me curious. I see a lot of people here posting about wanting to start writing, or how they've been at it for awhile. But I want to knot—what got you started into fanfiction? What did you read, or watch, or see that made you sit up and go, ""hey, I think I could tell a story with that idea."" What was the first spark that lit the flame?"
936,t3_g7qdbq,FanFiction,Fanfiction got me started on a writing career,"So... a little back story.

It’s December of 2018 and I’m on a mobilization to Fort Bliss as an army instructor.

I’m a huge Overlord fan, but I have a problem.

I’ve read all the LNs, and most of the good fanfics that people recommended.

But nobody wrote the story I wanted to read.  

I wanted a war.  But wars are big, complicated, tough to write well.

But I’m fucking bored.

So I get started, figuring it will take a few weeks.

February of 2020 comes, and I post the last chapter of a one million word story that is part of a 2 million word AU, on my 42nd birthday.

In that fourteen month period, I become addicted to writing.  Acknowledging the relative weakness of my early work, I’d begun reading books about writing.  I’d grind out thousands of words per day, and come away happy.

I came to realize that writing is what I want to do with my life, it is happiness.  I love a great story and seeing readers overjoyed by it.  Seeing someone say it made their day, or made them think or cry or happy or sad... touching the wealth of human experience through relatable characters....

I want to do nothing else.

So I began creating original work, and it’s now paying my internet bill.  It’s a small step forward, but all steps are small ones, and we still get where we want by taking them.

With that, I am happy."

941,t3_g8594x,FanFiction,Crossover Extravaganza,"I don't know why, but I LOVE me some crossover fanfics! There's just something magical about taking two otherwise unrelated universes and finding a unique way of bringing their worlds and characters together (the ""shared universe"" format is a really good one if they're similar enough). Hands down, my favorite part of the sub-genre is seeing some of your favorite characters from other medias interact with and bounce off of each others personalities. It's a great way to practice characterization and character dynamics.

Unfortunately, crossover fanfics are a double-edged sword. Sometimes a particular crossover combination between two fandoms you like simply doesn't exist and you're forced to write it yourself. Either that or it *does* exist but it's...

a) poorly written

b) abandoned

c) poorly written AND abandoned

What's the general consensus on crossover fanfics? I have an admittedly unhealthy fascination with them, but are they considered taboo? If not, which two fandoms would you like to see crossed over?"

943,t3_g88vg4,FanFiction,Quotev anyone? I'm impressed!,"I've been posting for a couple of years to FFN and AO3 (just donated thanks) and I think they both have fantastic features. Compared to the old days, they've made reaching an audience (however modest) a doddle.  I love the messaging features, the data and the cover art on FFN and I love the layout, the community feel and the fanfic-friendly options on AO3 like the tagging and kudos.

But I've been shopping around for ways to promote my stories a bit wider over the past two weeks, and now have uploaded/experienced the following:

* Fictionpad
* Story Pony
* HP Fanfiction
* Quotev
* To a lesser extent Tumblr

The only other really major one is Wattpad but...I'm sorry...I just can't.  DeviantArt is the other I'm aware of, but I don't think it really does HP.

I quite like FictionPad, and I have a one-shot up on there but I've also started to upload one of my longfics.  It did have a feature allowing to transfer over from FFN but I couldn't get it to work (prolly too long, lol)  Readership is very limited compared to FFN/AO3, but then they all are.

But I gotta send a shout-out to Quotev -  that is a cracker little site!  I had my one-shot up in about 15 minutes, with a profile, art and user-settings all complete.  I can get notifications and comments as well.  Tags are completely user-set.  Whether I get readers?  Well I'm happy with just a few.

The worst?  I'd say HP Fanfiction.  It was laborious and I had to re-enter every single paragraph break in over 10k words.  I haven't even bothered checking for hits because it's basically a Dramoine site as far as I can tell.

Tumblr - hmm, not great for posting prose, but good to upload promotional stuff.  I like making bookcovers and shit so good for that, but the investment to get air-time is too tiresome for me so it's languishing.

I also write original, so will be trying FictionPress, FictionPad and Quotev for that while it's in WIP.

Thought I'd share :D  What's been your experience with minor platforms?"

There is one I’m searching, it was set right after the battle of Hogwarts, so end book 7, all canon ( so there will be no changes through the reading about the ships - like I see some fics doing at the time 🤦‍♀️) .

I don’t remember how or why but all the dead, and I mean all of them like from Harry parents to Luna’s mother started to come back to life throughout the fics (like not all at once at the beginning).

They find the books and they decided to read them. Of course there was real quotes from the books, but I think the author decided to put [....] instead the books quotes because they started the purge of these fics. I PREFER THE FIRST VERSION WITH ALL THE QUOTES WRITTEN, but I accept the censured ones if I need to.

I remember it had a real current plot, like it wasn’t just them reading the books. They have breaks where their lives go on - I remember a scene where some death eaters attacked Harry to avenge the dark lord defeated or something (?)

And of course, for what I remember they interrupt the reading to speaking about something intelligent and relevant (at least most of the time) and NOT something stupid that just push some other characters to say to them to shut up.

However, sometimes I think about it. As such, I've renewed my old FFN account and started on a little weird thing over there. It's kind of a love letter to poetry while also being an AU Death Note fanfiction. It's not a character study or something filled with much dialogue, which I what I write on AO3, and it's definitely not my fandom, so that's kind of weird. But I like the lack of responsibility that comes with writing this little weird thing, literally nobody reads it. 

Plus, It's kind of fun having the ominous line of ""I have a secret FFN account' on my AO3 profile and my AO3 name written in Pig-Latin of my FFN's profile. I can't wait to see if anyone ever figures it out, even if they probably won't.

I might let them down.

Although it is a smutfic which was published at the end of Feb, and would obviously have been affected more by the lack of recorded guest hits than others, 11 of those 17 Kudos were from registered users, and it also has 5 comment chains as well, which is also my best, regardless of hits.

As proud as I am though, I also find it really frustrating that it seems to get such a good response from those who have read it, but still hasn't been read by that many (relatively, my highest hit count is 601).

But the problem is that her best friend makes the same mistake in far less sympathetic circumstances. And I have no idea how to make her sound not like a flaming trash heap?

It totally stomped out my motivation to write for that story because I have no idea how to take it and make the side character not seem like an asshole. But I don't want to trash a story I've put so much work and energy into just because of one lousy chapter.

I have a motivation for why the best friend did what she did, but it sounds super shitty on text. I don't have as much space to flashback or reiterate her personal feelings as I did with the protagonist. 

Mainly, I just have dialogue and that friend's body language/actions to work with, while she ""defends"" (I use that word loosely, obviously she knows that it's a mistake and admits that), well, 'explains' why she did what she did.

Part of me honestly wants to just remove the worst of the mistake entirely but that feels like a cheap-out.

Sigh."

964,t3_g8aa2s,FanFiction,Bangtan time travel fics,"Hi, I’m searching fanfics about BTS members time traveling. I’m good if they are the debutera!members that go in to the future and see what they achieved or the present!members go to the boys before the debut and show them what they achieved. 

They all need to travel back at some point, the only exceptions if it’s JK alone to travel, but I prefer all of them. 

They should be more realistic as possible, so no stereotypes or OCC ( example: SUGA being cold and indifferent ). 

NO PAIRINGS, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THEM, I love their bond so if it’s focus on their friendship/family bond it’s cool. 

The ONLY EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE VERY WELCOME ARE JIKOOK, and maybe some undefinable girlfriend for some of them ( but it’s not necessary for all of them) and most of all it’s not necessary having romance in the fic!

It need to be set recently, if not 2020, at the very least 2019, not before. I’ll accept 2018 setting only if it’s written very well and not to early in the year.  And around the debut year, so 2013 or before. (2014, if it’s well written).

Of course, I should need to say it... it needs to be long or close to the end. I saw so many of these kind of fics (across many fandoms) that starts very well just to stop after some chapters without any warning or news from the author for months, or worse years. AND IT NEED TO HAVE REAL PLOT, if you understand.

I know I am asking very specific conditions and maybe a fics that covers all of them doesn’t exist (yet) but if someone can rec a fic that covers some of these... I’ll be grateful 

NB. The most important condition are: 2019 set, NO stereotype. Regarding the others details I can do without it if really there isn’t nothing else"
965,t3_g7zeo6,FanFiction,Multiple OCs: Bad or Okay?,"**TL;DR:** I'm wondering if writing a story with multiple OCs is a turn off? 

I guess I have to give context that one of the fic's main genre is romance as the MC (obviously an OC) does end up with one of the significant characters. ~~Yes, I'm a shameful OC writer.~~  I don't want the whole story to revolve only about their relationship though. ^((I mean I love the other main canon characters too so I couldn't bring myself into turning them into background characters just for the heck of it))

Anyway, I made multiple OCs that also surrounds MC's life. Family, friends, acquaintances aka characters that she mostly also surround herself with to make drama, subplots, and ""arcs"" possible.  I'm a bit *???* if the subplots that involve with the OCs or relations with them will take away the focus on romance which readers may want to focus on as it is also mainly a romance fic?

^((It's like 2am and I'm probably overthinking for writing a damn OC story.)) It's probably a stupid question/thought but my inner critic is a devil and is always making me second guess everything lol."

I didn't got a lot of comments and reviews during these past months but I didn't let this fact dishearten me and I don't consider myself defeated until I have thrown all my forces in the battle.   
To all hard-working writers out there whose longfics are in the shadows of others, don't give up, fight for your fic. Popularity doesn't always equal to quality. Remember that for example, films that are now considered as classics have bombed or underperformed at the box-office when they were first released and only got later the recognition they deserved.  
Even if your number of followers is low, there might be loyal readers among them that will give you a review once your fic is finished so keep them in mind. And don't hesitate to post your fics on several sites to increase your chances of getting potential readers as each site or platform has its own ""mentality"".

968,t3_g7nnni,FanFiction,I hate how bad of a rep fanfiction gets,"I have ideas. Always have. Have tried working on my own original things but I'm just not passionate enough for them. I was into making my own fanfiction before I ever heard of the word. Then I felt like it was childish but in reality, it isn't. Sure, there's fanfiction I would avoid because it's not my thing or a fandom I'm a part of but people add their own lore and theories to games all the time (Minecraft is the perfect example) and that's not looked down upon at all until you mention the word 'fanfiction'. Once that word is mentioned, people look at you like a freak and I hate it.

Edit:  I should clarify that my mom sees writing fanfic as something really positive. She's actually really supportive of it, enjoys reading my work. I know her words are coming from a place of positivity. I just feel a bit...shy, I guess. One of my characters has a similar job as I do, and while she's not a self insert, I feel funny to let, say, my brother read about her.

974,t3_g873ga,FanFiction,What are some of your suggestions on writing fanfics? ✍️,"Hey guys, I’ve just joined to this subreddit. Looking for more people that are in love with writing as I am.

I’m currently planning a Marvel Comics fanfic. 

I’ll also try to keep up with the [Writing Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/fsv2z6/april_daily_prompts_quarantined_quests/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I’ve already requested an invitation to the AO3 (which I’m really excited about!). If there’s any advice or suggestions or basically anything, just tell me. I’m really looking forward to this!!! 👀 🧠. 

For now: What are some of your suggestions on writing fanfics?"
975,t3_g82ir5,FanFiction,Writing a horrible scene,"I'm writing a crossover fic, where I've taken a fairly cheerful shonen anime series, crossed it with a post cyberpunk anime series and given it a solid coating of violence, and I'm only in the fourth chapter! I'm kind of worried that I've gone kind of overboard with it.

I'm right now writing the fourth chapter, where the protagonist is caught in the middle of a false flag terrorist attack designed to draw  him out so that the organisation that created him can recapture him. I'm just writing a scene where a family is butchered in front of him and I'm trying to write it in a way to capture the horror involved without making it a case of shock value.

Worst part? His instincts are screaming for him to stop this, but he's going up against forty enemy combatants and six autonomous tank drones with a ten millimetre pistol and a combat knife.  

So, what I'm trying to ask is, how do you feel when you write something like this and how do you convey the horror you feel without making it be a case of shock value?

I'm trying to make sure the next chapter will be a cool down, with him 'adding more red to his ledger'."
976,t3_g7zjjn,FanFiction,Rewriting my fanfic because I've lost my original track,"My Criminal Minds fanfiction was on a good path until I stopped writing due to a sudden new job. I wrote one chapter, then three more a few months later. I was feeling good about my progress until I realized I was stumped on the actual pairing's progression for the story. So, I decided to write everything over from a certain point and as I'm doing it, I feel like I offended myself with how ridiculous it turned out from where I originally stopped, restarted, and started again. 

Has anyone else felt like this? They stopped updating due to certain circumstances, write, but stop because they feel like they've lost the essence of what the story initially was? Then, when looking back, it's like, ""What have I done?"" because things went off track in an unpleasant way?"
977,t3_g7zary,FanFiction,Restructuring on Ao3,"Hey all!

I've got a WIP up on Ao3 that I want to restructure. When I started it, I kept my chapters really short, but doubled by character perspective. (So character X would have two chapters in a row, then character Y would have two.)  Eventually, though, I started just combining the two chapters into one long one per character. 

After being on this sub, I worry that the short chapters at the beginning of my work might turn readers away. So I'd like to go back and restructure, so that it looks the same the whole way through.

I'm wondering if it'll confuse my subscribers, though, or if it'll mess with bookmarks, etc.

Any advice?"
978,t3_g7xh04,FanFiction,Empire/kingdom building longfic,"Hey, I'm looking for recs of fanfics where the main focus is on building of an empire. Looking for a power fantasy to escape into rather than something with equally smart opponents.

980,t3_g7n41a,FanFiction,Just a heads up,"If you ever get the comment ""Would you accept a \[your fandom\] challenge?"" and nothing else, check out the profile before you respond. A user on FFNet and AO3 had asked me and I regret blindly asking what the challenge was. 

Recently I saw this same user ask another author I happen to be following the same thing, and gave a link to a similar ""challenge"" they gave me. 

It's not a challenge so much as a request that you write the story they won't write themselves. They'll give you pages and pages of outline/wishlist of very specific things they want which include but not limited to: Overpowered OMC, fancast of every character, a harem of every female character in the fandom (literally), dialogue, and situation after situation where the OMC shows how great they are while at the same time shows how useless the canon males are. 

If that's your jam and it butters your biscuit, then by all means go forth and fanfic. But if you get uncomfortable with someone telling you ""smut required,"" and specifics for that smut then be aware.  They don't give any warning they will be asking you for smut/harem. 

Their profile is filled with works entitled ""\[fandom\]"" challenge.  All the challenges follow the same pattern I mention above. So if you see that, then that's who I am talking about and tell them no thank you or ignore them if that's not something you would want to do. If that's something you are into, then they have tons of these ""challenges"" across a lot of fandoms and you could be busy for a while."

982,t3_g7l80f,FanFiction,"Low expectations, still disappointed","I know how the game works. I know feedback (or lack thereof) has very little bearing on quality of a fic, but I was so proud of my latest chaptered fic until I started posting it. I worked my ass off on making it emotional and heartfelt, I ran it through two betas I trust who loved it and helped me make it the best it could possibly be. I knew it wasn’t going to make waves because this isn’t my first rodeo, but I hoped that it would get some reaction. 

Nothing. 

It’s a popular ship in a popular fandom, it has angst and romance, and I’m proud of my writing. I’ve been posting it for a few weeks so it’s not like I haven’t waited long enough. It’s just not what anyone wants to read. I know no one owes me any feedback, and I know feedback is all about the reader and has nothing to do with the writer, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less when no feedback comes. 

I have been writing for 20 years and sometimes I feel like I’m still screaming into a void. I write for myself, but the fact that I still can’t manage to write something other people enjoy makes me lose hope. I’m working on an original novel, but if I can’t make people care about characters they already love, who’s going to care about characters I made up?

Maybe I’m not cut out to be a writer, and maybe that’s okay. I have a good job (well, I’m currently furloughed), and I love writing as a hobby. Maybe that’s enough.

It’s just so disappointing. I came in with low expectations but it still hurts. And I’m not ungrateful, because I’ve had a few moderately successful fics in my time. But it seems like the more effort I put into a fic, the smaller the response. That makes me doubt my abilities. Sometimes I feel like technical proficiency is all I have, and that my stories don’t connect with readers. That’s not something I can fix.

I know this sub has too many posts like this already, but I just wanted to get some thoughts out because I am feeling pretty worthless. I think I take fanfiction and myself too seriously. 

I’m not giving up, but I think I need to take some time off from posting, and some time off from Twitter (which serves as a constant reminder that I am the only one who cares about my writing). Just write and read and keep my head down until I feel up to putting myself out there again. 

What does everyone else do to pick themselves back up after a fic flops?

Edit: Thanks for the commiseration, tough advice, and kind words. I write and read constantly, and consume tons of articles on improving writing, but every fic is a learning experience, and I’m going to suck it up, accept my failure, and keep moving."

989,t3_g7forf,FanFiction,Do authors ever tire of recurrent reviewers?,"As a New Year's resolution, I made it my goal to comment on every AO3 fic I read. Still going strong!

As someone who used to write, I know it's important to receive encouragement and support throughout. Writing is difficult. It can be tiring, mentally and emotionally. It's the very least us readers can do, and honestly, it's disheartening when I hear about authors not receiving the love they wholeheartedly deserve. 

Having said that, I've been reading and tracking this WIP, being sure to comment on every chapter. The writer's phenomenal, truly, and they claim my reviews are one of the highlights to writing their story. Despite this, I still feel a stab of insecurity every time, feeling as though it's sometimes too much — feeling as though they likely feel obligated to reply every time. I often apologise throughout my reviews.
