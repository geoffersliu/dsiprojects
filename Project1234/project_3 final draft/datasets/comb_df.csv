t3_ggf7zk,investing,What profits should we expect for a company that comes first in the covid race for a vaccine?,"I'm new to investing and have no background in finances etc

For example I like moderna, and let's assume it comes first in the race and passes all the trials. And let's say it produces 1B vaccine in a year, what growth should I expect solely on the covid 19 thingy?

Moderna has a lot more vaccine in development and so if covid vaccine works out, it would be a huge boost for everything else.. I don't like it for solely covid-19 efforts.

How do I estimate a company stock growth if I believe that a specific company produces an approved vaccine?

For example

INO 10.86 market cap 1.58B

MRNA 59.25 market cap 19.49B

What prices should I expect for them or any other company that produces a viable and approved vaccine for covid? Should I expect moderna at $300? $1000? $200?

I just have no idea, I'm certain it will be 2x for any of them(not just these 2, I don't know who wins), but that's just my lowest possible estimate.","What profits should we expect for a company that comes first in the covid race for a vaccine?I'm new to investing and have no background in finances etc

So my main question is, why wouldn't I just sell all my Enbridge shares and buy their preferred shares (like **TSE: ENB.PF.E**) instead?

t3_gga013,investing,The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

Any constructive criticism, feedback, and opinions are greatly appreciated.","The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up.

t3_gg82fe,investing,Is this the sort of situation Options are for?," 

I'm trying to figure out what Options are actually for so I came to realize that a situation I am in might be the purpose behind why Options exist.

So I have money in sort of like a bond that will mature in a couple months and I want to buy a particular stock I think has a good chance of increasing during that time. Is the purpose of buying an option as intended such that I can pay a little bit of money now to buy a Call such that I can buy the stock at a later date closer to its current price rather than the higher price later on.

For instance I would make the expiry after the bond thing matures and I would put the strike price such that the strike price + the fees and cost of the option are lower than what I can expect the stock to be trading at in a couple months.

This seems like the sort of thing Options are intended to be for, but when it is explained it is usually explained in the context of speculating, never when the money you would use to buy is non-liquid. In this situation the Option is a hedge against the increasing value of the stock while the money you would use to buy it is locked away.

The other situation I think Options are working as intended rather than as mere tools of speculation is when companies give stock options to their employees that are discounted as a form of compensation. The reason the Option gives a price that is different than the actual price in this situation is intended precisely because it is meant to encourage the employee to spend some of their money to get a stock which is worth more than they spent and the difference is compensation for them working such that the instant gain they get upon buying the discounted stock is a bit like a paid salary in that they could sell it immediately after buying it for market value.

If we go into more speculation territory buying an option sort of allows you to ""own"" various stocks at various prices without actually spending the money on them such that you could actually own another stock with that money at the same time. If something happens during that time that makes it a good buy for the strike price you could sell the stock you actually own, use the option, and then if you want you could immediately sell the option bought stock at the market value and re-buy the stock you were holding originally, perhaps even buying more of it with the profit you made with the quick sell-hold-stock, buy-call-stock-at-strike-price, sell-call-stock-for-market-value, buy-original-hold-stock. You could even layer this with many more Options than just one such that you could simultaneously ""own"" all the stocks with the same money with the risk being that your call expires before you have a good time to use it. This gives a lot more diversity than an otherwise small amount of money could provide, not to mention that the only risk you take if the price of these stocks drops is you are out the price of the Option rather than the price of the stock, the issue is you have to keep track of all that information, but if an algorithm did this ... well let's just say I now understand that guy who wanted me to make an options trading algorithm back in university that I turned down doing because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.","Is this the sort of situation Options are for?

t3_gg7k9d,investing,The problems with tech stocks,"OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

Retirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.

So, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).

Oh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.

If the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.

Further to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.

This is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good. The stock market is trying to say that, because of reduced competition, prices will soar, and as a result, the middle class craters into abject poverty and the world becomes less and less sustainable and stable and societal collapse is the only logical conclusion.","The problems with tech stocksOK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

t3_gg4lbj,investing,How does Blackrock have such a long arm?,"Looking at Blackrocks almost 100 billion dollar valuation is far from the depth their company has in the financial world. They can manage to control around 7 **trillion** worth of assets as well as almost 3 times that amount worth of insight through their enterprise software. Blackrock Solutions has insight on the very data it can invest in. Is this not some sort of breach?

This question has been bugging me for years now and I do understand the reason they can be auditors, advisors, and investors all at once. Financial markets are extremely complex and Blackrock has the resources and abilities to tackle financial issues governments and companies have. I understand why they are chosen to fix those issues. But how are they allowed to act in all those roles that overlap?

I do understand the heads of Blackrock are also the founders and they genuinely seem to have a positive interest in society as they are willing to shift and adapt their investment and other business to a more progressive time - think how Dicks and other stores stopped selling guns. This was due to Blackrocks ability to shift market sentiment based on their philosophies. No issues with their philosophies (above was only one example) - but what happens when Blackrock finds itself under new ownership with different views? Would this not completely shift the paradigm of the current financial world?

&amp;#x200B;

This is not to say they are untrustworthy, misguided, or are unable to pick successors. It just feels astonishing to see a company with such a far reach, especially in comparison to Vanguard, Schwab, State Street, or whoever.

t3_gg0vtt,investing,Why High Unemployment Doesn't Mean Stocks Should Fall,"* In the U.S., at least, a huge percentage of corporate earnings come from tech companies that generate huge profits from relatively few employees
* As an example of the above, consider Facebook, which earned $18 billion last year with 44,000 employees, and contrast it with GM, which earned about $6 billion with 164,000 employees
* This makes employment less relevant to corporate earnings than it was in the past (not to say there's not still a correlation)
* Not only that, but these tech companies have more flexibility to offer Work-From-Home arrangements than other companies do
* So their productivity needn't take a hit during this particular recession; advertising revenue will decline but not to a crippling degree
* Additionally, a good few of these tech companies have almost no debt. No debt means no interest expense, which makes it easier to turn profits even with revenue down.
* Some recent earnings reports bear this out, such as Facebook's 100% year-over-year growth in EPS, Amazon's 26% revenue growth, etc.
* Conclusion: publicly traded U.S. stocks as a class, particularly NASDAQ-listed ones, aren't necessarily seeing their fundamentals being hit that hard when you consider what a large percentage of their composition by market cap is tech stocks.
* Disclaimer: this analysis only applies to U.S. markets, I'm not aware of any other countries whose equity markets have such a heavy weighting in tech stocks.","Why High Unemployment Doesn't Mean Stocks Should Fall* In the U.S., at least, a huge percentage of corporate earnings come from tech companies that generate huge profits from relatively few employees

On the horizontal axis, the days of the year are numbered, so 1 = Jan 1st, 2= Jan 2nd, and so on...

**How did I produce this?**

I used the daily closing values for the Dow listed on [this website](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/DJIA/historical-prices). This was the most thorough stock market history I could find on short notice. Let me know if there is a better data set I can use!

I wrote a quick and dirty Python script to calculate the percentage change over every day ranging from 1971 until now and take the geometric mean of those changes for each day of the year, ranging from Jan 1 to Dec 31.

I then put all of those cumulatively together to graph the above.

**What about weekends and holidays?**

The trickiest part conceptually may have been how to interpolate the data to account for weekends and other market closures, since those do not come on regular dates. Since I was using closing values, what I ended up doing for a typical weekend was just geometrically averaging the change from Friday close to Monday close over Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

---

For example, let's say we have the following closing values:

Thurs: 9000
Fri: 9100
Mon: 9300

Then I would calculate the change for Friday to be: 9100/9000 = 1.01111
And I would calculate the change for Sat, Sun, and Mon to be (9300/9100)^1/3 = 1.00727

So the list of changes would look like:

Fri: 1.01111

Sat: 1.00727

Sun: 1.00727

Mon: 1.00727

---

It's not ideal, and can probably cause some artifacts, but it shouldn't matter too much when averaging over a lot of dates.

**Other Graphs:**

I also constructed similar graphs using [arithmetic mean of daily changes](https://imgur.com/dzHFwgt.png) and the [median of daily changes](https://imgur.com/McTs0sT.png).

The arithmetic mean graph is very similar to the geometric mean graph, but is a bit more extreme. This isn't too surprising.

The median graph is much more balanced, which also makes sense. It seems that the most dramatic effects of the first graph are caused by a relatively small number of extreme years.

It would also be really easy to adapt my code to work with a different time span or index. I would just need the data. It might be interesting to compare the average annual performance of different sectors or market caps.

t3_gfvwq5,investing,New York City CMBS Delinquencies Rise on $7 Billion of Loans,"By Natalie Wong

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s shutdown is pressuring loans
tied to commercial real estate, with retail and hotels hit the
hardest.
April payments were late on about $7 billion of commercial
mortgage-backed securities debt backed by properties in the
city, more than double the amount a year earlier, according to
data firm Trepp.
About $740 million of those loans are considered
delinquent, meaning at least 30 days behind. Retail and lodging
debt, the sectors with the highest percentage of delinquencies,
accounted for 41% and 19% of the total.
Stay-at-home orders have crushed business at stores,
restaurants and hotels in New York, the center of the
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Owners of these properties --
including hotels in Times Square and shops on Fifth Avenue --
are struggling to pay mortgages as their rent collections fall.
The rate of delinquencies could grow if borrowers continue
to skip payments in May, which is likely given the shutdown’s
impact on the economy.
Some landlords are working out payment arrangements with
their lenders, but options are limited. Special servicers, firms
assigned to handle vulnerable CMBS loans on behalf of
bondholders, are too short-staffed to manage the sudden surge of
defaults and modification requests, said Justin Piasecki, a
principal at brokerage Avison Young.

Kinda have a theory and I want to tap your thoughts. With the number of people unemployed many are currently collecting unemployment benefits. of course out of the 30 million unemployed maybe half or three quarters actually have a retirement savings plan and or health savings account. Once that runs out, people are going to start tapping into their IRA/s 401ks and other retirement savings to live on pay bills, rent, mortgage, and make ends meet. Once people start accessing their retirement savings in numbers, many funds will have to liquidate their holdings. Fund will have not choice but to liquidate parts of their holdings. With the outflow of capital this may create a domino effect in which people with regular investment accounts will start to sell. This may weigh heavily on stocks.

t3_gfsn42,investing,Leaps vs stocks ?,"Why are leaps not considered a great option to invest long term? 
In context: 
So many companies are undervalued but personally  for me it’s impossible to buy a 100 shares of them outright right now. Instead buying a leap a 1 year out would give me enough time to save up for them and also have the company grow back in value. For ex:
A big bank like Bank of America is trading at around 23$, a hundred shares of which would cost me 2300$.  Why not just buy the atm 25$ call for 2.27 and break even of 27.27$ per share(expiring Jan 2021)? 
These stocks are bound to recover as they provide the backbone for the economy (to an extent). So then going to even half of the value they were last year(~35ish) isn’t impossible. 


What’s a good case against buying a leap ? Except for basically loosing the 227$ in the call option.","Leaps vs stocks ?Why are leaps not considered a great option to invest long term?

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■","A dangerous gap: The market v the real economy — The Economist, May 7 2020 edn.

t3_gfoii9,investing,There might be a logical reason to why the markets keep going up,"Many people seem perplexed about this fact. Bad news should mean that the market should go down. Problem is, bad news means more action from the state/fed. One action is as we all know 0% interest rates. What return do you need to make a profit with 0% interest rates? Anything above 0.

This means that if you can borrow money at 0% and expect a return of 0,000001% you are making a profit. The Fed saying that they will do everything to get full emplyment back means that some investors see the doom and gloom headlines as a confirmation that the Fed will keep rates low. This signals that it's worth borrowing money to put into the market, because any return above 0 is worth it. 

The only question is how long this will last. My guess is when positive news starts taking the overhand, investors will scale back their risk. Simply because the 0% interest rate and state action is less likely to last as long the more positive the sentiment gets on the economy. Sentiment will be more positive in the news and stocks will be going down. People will say that it's rigged - but it's not. It's just how the markets work, even if you hate it.

At least this is how I interpret the current situation and I am short on the market. Unless Fed and State turns positive in their sentiment, my investment is pretty much screwed. But I'm aware of this and I could of course be wrong.

No clue if anyone agrees with me on this, but this is what I think is happening currently.","There might be a logical reason to why the markets keep going upMany people seem perplexed about this fact.

At least this is how I interpret the current situation and I am short on the market. Unless Fed and State turns positive in their sentiment, my investment is pretty much screwed. But I'm aware of this and I could of course be wrong.

t3_gfnavf,investing,Perhaps the most relevant excerpt from one of Ray Dalio's book,"""In the early stages of a bubble bursting, when stock prices fall and earnings have not yet declined, people mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find stocks cheap in relation to both past earnings and expected earnings, failing to account for the amount of decline in earnings that is likely to result from what’s to come. But the reversal is self-reinforcing. As wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, which hurts spending and lowers investment rates while also making it less appealing to borrow to buy financial assets. This in turn worsens the fundamentals of the asset (e.g., the weaker economic activity leads corporate earnings to chronically disappoint), leading people to sell and driving down prices further. This has an accelerating downward impact on asset prices, income, and wealth.""

Is this something I should just ride out, stomach the losses right now, and keep maxing out my Roth IRA every year into these funds because Value Equities have performed very well historically?  


Or is this something I really need to be concerned about due to the high expense ratios and how poorly Value Equities have performed the last decade?  


These loses are hard to stomach at the moment but if I am going by history things will work out. I really don't want to sell out of these funds (Especially since I am at a loss right now) but considering this is my retirement, I am willing to do whatever is necessary.

t3_gfjlre,investing,Can someone help me better understand dividend investing?,"I like the idea of dividend investing but I feel there are many arguments on BOTH sides. I'd like to present a few and discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Dividend stocks aren't good because they just remove from the stock price.**

So that's true. I don't think dividend stocks are good for growth. I think it is a great capital preservation if the company is solid like $T. They are the same price as they were four years ago and it is an excellent way to accumulate shares.

**My question:** Is this more of a wealth preservation option? What about growth dividends? I'd say AAPL and SBUX are examples of this (although I think AAPL is starting to mature as a company, but that is a different problem set on its own).

**2) If they don't grow, why bother?**

I'm not sure what to say about this. Hence the reach out for opinions. I feel that while they don't excel as much as growth stocks, they do grow faster than bonds. A safe bet, IMO. Of course, assuming it is a diversified spread like SPHD which I own a small portion of.

**My question:** Can someone give opinions of good growth dividend stocks that I have not mentioned already? Secondly, can someone help me rationalize point two, where it gives a purpose for dividend investing?

**3) DRIP or no?**

I have a question on this  one. Why not DRIP? If not drip, I guess you can  use the dividend to invest in something else. However, I want to drip so that my dividend stocks accumulate faster. Catch22?

**My question:** I only gave an example of why DRIP is good or not good. Can someone give an argument for both sides?

**4) When to buy?**

I think it is best to buy dividend stocks during a recession. I say this for three good reasons. The first reason is to **accumulate as many shares as possible.** You can not only buy cheap shares at times of recession, you also accumulate shares with dividends. It is a win win if you ask me. My next reason is that I don't really have to worry about selling out. Finally, with dividends, I do have a **cash flow coming in** if I needed it (hopefully not relying on dividend income though lmao). Getting a few low thousand a months through dividends is not that far off or unattainable IMO?

With a grain of salt though, because companies cancel their dividend like Disney and Ford. Fair enough, but that's why I try to mitigate that risk by avoiding individual companies or selecting individual companies with historical dividends (Look up dividend aristocrats). Companies like KO etc. Of course if KO stops giving dividends, then we are in bigger trouble than we realize and cash would be a better alternative.

**My question:** I say the best time is to buy Dividend stocks during recessions. Why? Best way to accumulate shares. Can someone puncture my argument? Secondly, What dividend strategy do you use (loaded question, would appreciate it though)?

**5) Placement**

This one is easy, put it in your tax advantaged accounts. My question is, is there a good position or opportunity in a taxable account? I would put it in a taxable account if I needed to withdraw the dividend income (not DRIP). Unfortunately I live in California so I am dicked.

**My question:** Can anyone think of a scenario/strategy where taxation would be mitigated or even somewhat effective? More specifically and in addition to, when/how would you put in a taxable account? Please don't say when you  have no additional room in your tax-advantaged. That is assumed in this question.

Thank you guys for reading. Please be safe during these hard times. Best.

1) Let’s say we have a business to be opened, and this project requires $100,000 of initial investments.

Interest rate is 10% for simplicity. The profits are shared at 30% to 70%.
How do we calculate NPV? I guess there should be 2 different NPVs, because partners have different initial outlays and cash flows. Am I right?
Or NPV of the project is calculated for the whole project?

2) But what if we add loan to our case? Let’s say two partners invest 30% and 30% (30,000 each) and 40,000 is a loan. Interest rate is 10%. Interest rate on loan is 20%.

I am wondering whats your thoughts on shell, so far I have lowered my losses to only around 150 dollars, I have enough stocks that a 3% jump can turn my loses to profit, yet a bit of a dip will do the absolute opposite.

t3_gf3cfc,investing,Housing A Risky Investment?,"I know this is outside the purview of options bullshit but it’s an investment that is frequently leveraged up the ass.  3% down and you get 100% of the profit or loss, with favorable margin rates.

Here’s my theory:

A significant component in the rise of housing prices since the 1980s is due to declining interest rates.  The supply is constrained so it’s responsive to the ability of buyers to outbid each other.  Americans are used to the idea of spending 30% or whatever of their household income on their mortgage payment, maybe more.  If interest rates drop but real wages stay the same and the percentage of money spent on housing stays the same, then the principal has to increase.  Which means housing prices go up.

But now we’re pretty much touching against risk adjusted 0% interest rates.  If it was any cheaper the bank might as well be paying you.  The interest rate cannot keep dropping in order to fuel more housing price increase.  So there’s not really any more room for housing prices to boost off low interest rates.  There’s probably still time until they adjust to current rates and an increase when the economy eventually picks up again, but the growth seen over the past three decades is coming to an end.

Also, there’s significant risk if inflation picks up.  If housing and wages both rise in pace with inflation their ratio stays the same, but interest rates will also climb.  This means that buyers must now commit a larger portion of their gross income to P&amp;I payments.  If lenders won’t allow them to do that then the only way to accommodate increased i is by lowering p.  Which means housing has to lose value if that happens.","Housing A Risky Investment?I know this is outside the purview of options bullshit but it’s an investment that is frequently leveraged up the ass.  3% down and you get 100% of the profit or loss, with favorable margin rates.

That   said, I don't understand the reasoning of the rule. Why is it ok to  buy  if you don't have the cash yet, but not sell ??    I also don't   understand the difference between the two examples.

Finally   what i don't understand is the concept of ""settled cash"".

t3_gf1q5k,investing,Boeing... Take my losses or hold?,"Boeing is too big to fail. America's national security depends on Boeing's continued existence (not necessarily financial success). This much I know. I bought big during the recent nosedive, and it appears it's actually not done bottom-ing out. I know that waiting 1-2 years would yield me a fat profit. It's almost guaranteed. But the question is, do I want to wait while there are other, more conscious-friendly options out there?

My beef with Boeing's business model is that they have some really bad executives running the company into the ground long term. Boeing executives are the prototypical corporate dickhead Chad-types, who only look for short term gain at all cost. They are really the caricature of greed and privilege. Boeing spent considerable amount of their capital buying back stocks and executive comps, which inherently has 0 value to the company's business success. Management's comp tied to stock performance is great for stockholders, but that has not materialized for me yet. Most recently, Boeing refused government bailout money and opted to be beholden to private banks because taking government money would mean the CEO and his buddies would not be able to fire employees, continue stock buybacks in the future, and do all the things required of a conscientious, socially responsible corporation.

Boeing seems to be a double whammy. It has a shitty business model and declining stock price. Is it time to take my losses and get out now? If I get out now, I cap probably cap my losses under $1000.","Boeing... Take my losses or hold?Boeing is too big to fail.

t3_gf16kn,investing,"A wave of bankruptcies, surging taxes, and Americans harboring lasting scars from coronavirus lockdowns — the head of world’s largest asset manager warns of grim outlook","BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

When I purchased them, I enabled dividend reinvestment, as I pretty much always do. Since I bought them, the price has tanked to 11.13 or so.

However, looking at my Schwab purchase history, the dividend reinvestment purchases have been happening at exactly 12.08 dollars every month, which means I've been paying above market price for every single acquisition. PONAX is the only fund I own exhibiting this behavior, all my other funds seem to dividend reinvest at the current market price for the day of the distribution.

Is there something I'm not understanding, or am I giving PONAX free money?","Noob question: Why isn't the dividend reinvestment price always the current sale price?I own some shares of PONAX, which i purchased last year at 12.08 dollars.

It seems everyone suggested somewhere 15%-25% of the portfolio in Emerging Markets for a young person saving for retirement. And it seemed to be the highest risk/reward category. 

I've consistently followed this advice. A decade without a recession and EM is  the worst performing of the bunch. You'd think it would've been the best!?!

t3_gevst0,investing,Vanguard’s Market Cap ETFs Are Not What They Seem,"I’m thinking of putting together a market cap etf portfolio with a 60/25/15 allocation from large to small. I’ve been looking at vanguards market cap blend ETFs and upon closer look them seem to not accurately reflect the traditional definitions of the market capitalizations they should represent. 

Generally, the market cap ranges are as follows...
Small: $300 Million to $2 Billion
Mid: $2 Billion to $10 Billion
Large: $10 Billion or Higher

The median market capitalization for each ETF should fall in line with these ranges if it is accurate.

Below are the main Vanguard Market Cap ETFs and the median market cap value for each.

VB: Small Cap ($3.6 Billion)
VO: Mid Cap ($13.4 Billion)
VV: Large Cap ($112.7 Billion)

Most of these ETFs have a median value above the usual metrics. The Small Cap ETF is really a Mid Cap ETF. The Mid Cap ETF is really a Large Cap ETF. The Large Cap ETF is valued in the middle of a Large Cap and a Mega Cap (Mega Cap being a value of over $200 Billion) so this seems ok to me.

There are other ETFs offered through Vanguard that more accurately hit the definition. These follow along the S&amp;P Index for each capitalization. They are listed below with the median market cap value.

VIOO: S&amp;P 600 Small Cap ($1.4 Billion)
IVOO: S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap ($4.3 Billion)
VOO: S&amp;P 500 Large Cap ($118.7 Billion)

With the exception of VOO, these other ETFs have a median value of about a third of the other respective funds and they are also traded much less. Only VOO has a substantial Total Net Asset Value.

VOO is worth a staggering $443.6 Billion. It’s cousin, VV is only worth $21.9 Billion. Clearly, investors prefer to hold VOO. The same is true for the others.

IVOO is worth $1.6 Billion, VO is worth $84.6 Billion.
VIOO is worth $1.7 Billion, VB is worth $69.3 Billion.

Investors clearly prefer the funds that don’t follow the metrics.

Why would vanguard throw in a substantial amount of stocks that are in the next market cap tier into funds of lesser value? Is it to smooth out the volatility that small caps and mid caps usually experience? Or have stocks gone up in value so much that the traditional definitions no longer fit and Vanguard is making their own definitions. Comparing a $10 Billion company today to what a $10 Billion company was 20 years is not a fair comparison. Since we’re in the age of Mega Caps, should the metrics be expanded across all fronts to accommodate this change?

*just found this explanation from Investopedia...

“large investments in small companies can actually have the effect of adversely affecting the share price of the small company being bought or sold in the fund. For this reason, small-cap stock funds that have high net assets tend to buy stocks of larger-capitalization companies, which can cause the fund to evolve into a mid-cap stock fund, getting away from the fund's initial focus. This is called style drift”","Vanguard’s Market Cap ETFs Are Not What They SeemI’m thinking of putting together a market cap etf portfolio with a 60/25/15 allocation from large to small.

""I show our net, our cash and Treasury bill position on March 31st. And you might look at that and say, “Well, you’ve got $125 billion or so in cash and Treasury bills. And you’ve got…” At least at that point, we had about, I don’t know, $180 billion or so in equities.

But we really have far more than that in equities because we own a lot of businesses. We own 100% of the stock of a great many businesses, which to us are very similar to the marketable stocks we own. We just don’t own them all. They don’t have a quote on them. But we have hundreds of billions of wholly owned businesses. So our $124 billion is not some 40% or so cash positions, it’s far less than that.

- My credit score is 700-720, will that help me when getting a loan? (I’m only 20) 


-I use my local credit union and I plan on getting a loan through them, or should I use a big bank? 



Is there anything I should specifically look out for or plan on doing in the meantime while waiting until I purchase the property?",0,owner burner account leave information location people property cheap rent high live live southern vermont usa northeast usa incase anyone sure vt couple ago looking invest first real estate property real estate extremely cheap small sub k population city live plan live one unit payment self aware require show year tax return plan buy year june question property sale k income minimum purchase property bank score help getting loan use local union plan getting loan use big bank anything specifically look plan meantime waiting purchase property

t3_get1nm,investing,$RSI - Rogers Sugar - good TSX-listed yield play,"I've been keeping an eye on and recently bought TSX:RSI. It's currently trading at a 7.5%+ yield and is still trading about 25% off pre-COVID highs. \~$95mm EBITDA business with $5-$10mm of maintenance capex. Brokers are shitting on it because they didn't hit Q2 estimates (+25% EBITDA growth, whereas they were flat), but given the climate we're in - and yield it's trading at - IDGAF.

**Some thoughts on why I like it:**

* **Stable volume.** Yes, per capita sugar consumption is declining, but with NA population growth, it's stable to moderately growing. And with everything going on in the world, the fact that volumes have not been impacted is positive.
* **Limited price risk.** Sugar is a transparent, liquid market. RSI matches future sales to purchases, so it doesn't take commodity risk. It basically earns a dollar margin per lb.
* **Stable free cash flow.** Given the above, FCF is quite stable. Maintenance capex is relatively small. The company is a bit of a NWC pig, but given low volume/price risk above it's been manageable.
* **Low risk to distribution.** Given stable FCF and $100mm of borrowing room, distributions don't appear to be at risk. Payout ratios are high (biggest knock on RSI), but in a flat market and modest capital needs, what else are would they do with that cash.
* **Free option on Maple Syrup.** RSI acquired one of the largest maple syrup producers in 2017, which has been an absolute dog. But that capital has been spent, and so I view earnings to be somewhat trough-y.
* **Installed capacity.** I've been looking for businesses with good installed capacity in this market. Companies with solid PP&amp;E that have some nameplate capacity and earnings power. I like them because negative operating leverage is hitting earnings hard, but you should get torque on the way out of COVID. RSI isn't experiencing this, but it's good downside protection.
* **Duopoly producer.** One of two sugar producers in Canada, and no one is investing in processing capacity any time soon given growth trends.
* **Structural market benefits.** USA sugar market is a protected market with high import tariffs that can mean prices that are 2x Canadian prices. Food producers can manufacture in Canada with cheap sugar, and then import finished products into America without tariffs; drives steady demand.

**This one isn't without its hair:**

* **Future volume.** While it's positive that volumes were strong in Q2 2020, that might reflect contracts they sold well before COVID. That said, their product is going into shelf-stable products and confectionary, which are experiencing record-high demand.
* **Supply chain.** If RSI can't get their hands on raw materials because international supply chains are clogged up, then that would be a big deal. It looks like they have about 3 mos of inventory on hand.
* **Payout ratio.** It does have a high payout ratio and you can sensibly argue it's risky. I don't see it, but I understand the argument.
* **Leverage.** Aside from 4.0x debt, the capital structure is stinky. A bunch of convertible debt outstanding (5%, converts at $8.00+) which might preclude the Company taking on additional debt and issuing additional equity - distributions would be first to go.
* **Insider governance.** Finally, the governance structure is a bit of a mess that I think might ward off interested acquirers in considering a takeover.","$RSI - Rogers Sugar - good TSX-listed yield playI've been keeping an eye on and recently bought TSX:RSI.

TLDR: If you could buy 100 shares below $22.49 and the share price rises on the 14th as everyone is buying in, the put premium should also get cheaper. Buy 6/19 $30p for $7.50 or less. This would save you money on all sides and you could actually get a decent return not accounting for taxes. In theory of course.","By now you've all seen the LORL dividend announcement.By now you've all seen the LORL dividend announcement. Here's how to play it,

If you buy $30p 6/19 with current mark @ $7.50 and you can in turn buy your shares for anything less than $22.49 then you could make money.

t3_gekay7,investing,Shopify Recent #'s + Mercadolibre +23% after earnings,"E-commerce doing well - Shopify with some interesting stats (see bolded) and Mercadolibre, too.

SHOP:

**New stores created on the Shopify platform grew 62% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 compared
to the prior six weeks**, driven by the shift of commerce to online as well as by the extension of the free trial
period on standard plans from 14 days to 90 days. While this increase includes both first-time entrepreneurs
as well as established sellers, it is unclear how many in this cohort will sustainably generate sales, which is
the primary determinant of merchant longevity on our platform. New store creations represents merchants
who have provided billing information, which also allows them to start selling.


While year-over-year Gross Merchandise (""GMV"") growth accelerated in April compared with the
first quarter of 2020, and this growth was distributed over a broader base of merchants, it is unclear how
sustainable consumer spending levels will be in this uncertain economic environment. For now, the shift of
consumer spending toward online is apparent: the number of consumers estimated to have made a purchase
for the first time from any Shopify merchant grew 8% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, compared
to the six-week period immediately prior. Over the same period, the number of consumers estimated to have
purchased from Shopify merchants they’d never shopped at before grew by 45% compared to the six-week
period immediately prior.

**While GMV through the point-of-sale (POS) channel declined by 71% between March 13, 2020 and April 24,
2020 relative to the comparable six-week period immediately prior to March 13, as most of Shopify’s Retail
merchants suspended their in-store operations, *Retail merchants managed to replace 94% of lost POS GMV
with online sales over the same period*.** Retail merchants are adapting quickly to social-distance selling, as
26% of our brick-and-mortar merchants in our English-speaking geographies are now using some form of
local in-store/curbside pickup and delivery solution, compared to 2% at the end of February.

While new types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus, March and April also saw
more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February.

Certain categories of GMVgrew faster between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, including Food, Beverages,

SHOP:

**New stores created on the Shopify platform grew 62% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 compared
to the prior six weeks**, driven by the shift of commerce to online as well as by the extension of the free trial
period on standard plans from 14 days to 90 days. While this increase includes both first-time entrepreneurs
as well as established sellers, it is unclear how many in this cohort will sustainably generate sales, which is
the primary determinant of merchant longevity on our platform. New store creations represents merchants
who have provided billing information, which also allows them to start selling.


While year-over-year Gross Merchandise (""GMV"") growth accelerated in April compared with the
first quarter of 2020, and this growth was distributed over a broader base of merchants, it is unclear how
sustainable consumer spending levels will be in this uncertain economic environment. For now, the shift of
consumer spending toward online is apparent: the number of consumers estimated to have made a purchase
for the first time from any Shopify merchant grew 8% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, compared
to the six-week period immediately prior. Over the same period, the number of consumers estimated to have
purchased from Shopify merchants they’d never shopped at before grew by 45% compared to the six-week
period immediately prior.

**While GMV through the point-of-sale (POS) channel declined by 71% between March 13, 2020 and April 24,
2020 relative to the comparable six-week period immediately prior to March 13, as most of Shopify’s Retail
merchants suspended their in-store operations, *Retail merchants managed to replace 94% of lost POS GMV
with online sales over the same period*.** Retail merchants are adapting quickly to social-distance selling, as
26% of our brick-and-mortar merchants in our English-speaking geographies are now using some form of
local in-store/curbside pickup and delivery solution, compared to 2% at the end of February.

While new types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus, March and April also saw
more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February.

Certain categories of GMVgrew faster between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, including Food, Beverages,
and Tobacco, which doubled during this period relative to the 6-weeks immediately prior to March 13. Apparel

t3_gek53d,investing,Trying to understand the whys and hows of negative price in crude oil,"Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.

With the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.

So here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: ""If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?""

But let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.

1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.

1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?

1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that ""The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible"". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?

1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?

1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?

1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?

1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.

1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?

1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?

1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I’m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won’t be interested in small transaction? What’s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.

1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?

2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  
quite confusing

2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?

2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?

2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?

2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?

2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?

3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  
anybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  
with classic brokers.

3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren’t they?

3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.

3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?

3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?

3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:

\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?

\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts

\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?

\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO

3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?

3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?

3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?

3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?

3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?

3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?

3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?

3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?

3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?

Thanks for reading this until the end and thanks in advance for your answers.","Trying to understand the whys and hows of negative price in crude oilDisclaimer, this is going to be a long message.

t3_gejaoc,investing,Analysis of penny stock WLL," 

For someone who is interested in penny stocks, here is my way to analyze WLL for your reference.

On April 1, WLL filed for chapter 11 to restructure. The price of WLL tumbled from 0.8-1 to 0.3-0.4 after the declaration. By the RTS (restructure term sheet) WLL filed to SEC on April 1, original stockholder will get 3% new issued shares (97% belongs to unsecured Note’s holder) and 15% warrants (4-5years duration), all subject to be diluted by the 8% stock stimulus package for the management and employees after restructuring.

According the “un-levered”, “low CAPEX” version pro-forma (lender Cleansing Materials) attached at the same filing, average FCF per year is 136m for the coming years. If we use 10x FCF for valuation, WLL’s equity value post-restructuring will be 1360m. If the Qty of new shares issued is the same as the original shares, there will be 91m post-restructuring shares outstanding. Thus, by estimation, stock price will be around 15 per share in the coming years if everything goes as the pro-forma. The value of each pre-restructuring share will be 15\*0.03\*0.92=0.414 after restructuring.

As for the warrants, exercise price is 110% and 125% of the amount of current unsecured note’s value, which is around 2B. According to the equity value we derived from the pro-forma, those warrants will not be in the money for the coming years. However, if the oil price surges tremendously within 4-5 years, say 60 USD up, those warrants might feedback fruitful return.

Furthermore, there are still 1B secured loan subject to be unimpaired by the RTS. How the company will pay the bill is still uncertain.

Generally speaking, evaluating company like this is highly speculative. In my opinion, the range of the estimated value of pre-restructuring WLL equity is very large, depends on how you assess the value of warrants and the feasibility of the pro-forma. I think price below 0.3 might be a bargain. How much markup you would like to pay will depend on how your confidence for the pro-forma and the perspective of oil price.

The investment for the penny stocks is never an easy job and requires much more detail study and check. The abnormal high return just reflects the extra efforts demanded for the time-consuming analysis and the super high speculative nature for those investments.","Analysis of penny stock WLL

t3_geipe5,investing,Thoughts on CLO over the course of this recession?,"I'm starting to like reviewing Mayra Rodriguez Valladares articles over the past year or so on CLO.

&gt; I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”

I'm more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it's left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.

I don't see how they won't fail as S&amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can't refinance any more.

How far do you think the Fed is really going to wade into this shit? Isn't it too risky for them?

Thoughts?","Thoughts on CLO over the course of this recession?I'm starting to like reviewing Mayra Rodriguez Valladares articles over the past year or so on CLO.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95)

&gt; I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”

I'm more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it's left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.

I don't see how they won't fail as S&amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can't refinance any more. Here's some more reading.

t3_geip3y,investing,How is the AMC vs Universal Studios tiff going to resolve?,"All the news articles are making it look like AMC fired the first shot by saying they won’t be playing universal films in their theaters at all anymore, but I think it’s obvious that universal instigated this by saying they would no longer honor the theatrical release window. 

I think this was a short sighted move on universal’s part. Yes, Trolls2 was wildly more successful than anticipated, but this was a result of such morbidly special circumstances that it can’t reasonably be used as a way to predict future success. I also wonder how many of those $20 rentals were accidental purchases from kids who just happened to have the remote in hand. 

With such a massive collection of movies available in every streaming platform’s catalog already built into the subscription fee, can we really assume $20-$30 for a 48 hour rental of a new release is going to become part of streaming culture? And if it does, that is still a fraction of the revenue a theater would generate from getting a family in the doors. 

I guess the question is this: are there enough families willing to pay for that rental fee, who might otherwise have waited until after the theatrical release to see the movie? And by “enough”, I mean significantly more than the number of families who would have gone to the theater but will choose to stream instead. 

My guess is no.

And now that AMC put their foot down (with cineworld joining their side), it will almost certainly be a net loss in revenue for Universal. 

So what will universal do? Hold their ground? Look for a compromise? Walk back the move entirely? Unless theaters get a say in the specific titles and the number of releases distributed this way every year, I can’t see them reaching a compromise any other way.","How is the AMC vs Universal Studios tiff going to resolve?All the news articles are making it look like AMC fired the first shot by saying they won’t be playing universal films in their theaters at all anymore, but I think it’s obvious that universal instigated this by saying they would no longer honor the theatrical release window.

&gt; Shareholders on Monday approved a plan to **convert nearly $1 billion of debt into equity and raise up to 400 million crowns ($39 million) from the sale of new shares** to help the airline survive the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Norwegian aims to sell new shares at 1.0 crown each, it said, far less than Tuesday's closing price of 4.80 crowns as it seeks to attract investors even while the debt conversion leads to a massive dilution of ownership stakes.

&gt; **If the process fails however, Norwegian Air is at risk of running out of money by mid-May** even though it only pays invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, it said on April 27.

&gt; The debt conversion will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and **could leave current shareholders with just 5.2%**, and with further dilution for owners who do not take part in the share issue.

t3_gegnaf,investing,Which markets or industries do you see perform best in the next decades (geographic vs. industry focus vs. cap size)? How do you build this into a strategy and portfolio to maximize expected risk-adjusted future returns?,"I often get confused when people here argue whether one could beat ""the market"". Which ""market"" are they referring to? Assuming Equities, which equities and index? MSCI World? S&amp;P500? FTSE100? ASX200? Emerging markets? 

Many portfolios suggested here seem to suggest a strong U.S. bias for equities, and even an MSCI world would have almost 40% U.S. equity exposure. While it's true that the S&amp;P500 has had strong past returns over many time periods, there's plenty of research suggesting that over the same periods other markets have outperformed.

Let's assume for a minute that ""the market"" is the S&amp;P500 (or MSCI world index, irrelevant for my point). In times of low-cost ETFs widely available and being able to shift the weightings of one's portfolio relatively easily to replicate a strategy, I think it makes sense to compare this reference index and their **risk adjusted returns** to other indices along different dimensions. For equities, the obvious ones are

* **Geographic focus**  
Comparing reference indices in different countries can be an interesting exercise. Quite surprisingly, the Australian, South African, and Swedish stock market have had higher *risk adjusted* returns over different periods (16 years, 40 years, 116 years) than the S&amp;P500.

One might also look into historic performance of emerging markets vs. U.S, Europe or OECD.

There's plenty of research suggesting that small caps, at least in certain geographies, have historically outperformed large cap over long periods of time.

* **Company/market maturity**  
Over the past decade, 'growth' stocks have outperformed 'value'-stocks in the U.S. and other markets. 
* **Sector focus**  
Similarly, if one had put more emphasis on tech (e.g. NASDAQ) and placed their bet on buying QQQ, returns would have significantly higher since the past bull run. 

Now obviously past performance does not predict future returns, but it's one data point and can be considered alongside other factors. These include current valuations of such markets or sectors (particularly when it comes to investing lump sums at a certain point of time) and more importantly larger themes such as changes in political landscapes and the geopolitical environment, climate change and shift towards renewables, urbanization (or de-urbanization due to COVID?), digitization, etc.

With a lot of data on past performance of different indices available and reflecting on major socioeconomic and political trends that will shape our lives in the next decades, I'd be interested in creating a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs, which over the next 20-30 years is likely to outperform the classic bogleheads 3-fund portfolio or an MSCI world and potentially offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to those indices. Suggestions should be evidence-based on a combination of past returns and outlook into the future, rather than saying ""just put your money into FANG or an AI or ROBO-ETF"".

t3_gec16b,investing,Investing Behavior Survey,"Survey time!  

I wanted to get a pulse check to see how this sub is handling their investment behavior going forward.  

After the aggressive April rally, we are starting to see some of the economic effects (bankruptcies, more layoffs, more corporate debt concerns).  If you were to characterize your current and near term (next 6-12 month) investing behavior, how would you classify it?  

* 100% invested and planning on aggressively investing more if there is another downturn
* Positions are trimmed but will reinvest if there is another downturn
* Positions are trimmed and will stay on the sidelines until the dust clears

Personally, I am the latter.   I have about 60% of my investable money on the sidelines.  I am not waiting for the crash or trying to time the bottom, I just do not feel comfortable having all of my marbles in the market with so much uncertainty.  

Background: I am early 30s, stable income, no debt.  Have a 6 month emergency fund.  Everything else is free to be invested.  40% invested in equities (24% ETFs, 12% blue Chips, 4% in speculative fun stocks), the other 60% is free to be invested but sitting on the sidelines.

t3_ge858j,investing,Buying an ETF that uses options to protect against downside risk: $NUSI,"I'm currently planning to enter the market and I'm concerned about volatility, since I would like access to the funds on a 7-10 year horizon. 

I came across an interesting ETF that uses an option collar strategy to protect against downside risk That is, it sells calls against the underlying securities and then uses the revenue to buy protective puts.

It's called **NUSI**, or *Nationwide Risk-Managed Income ETF*.

It's appealing to me for a few reasons:

* I looked at its performance during the recent crash and it outperformed everything else (SPY, QQQ, etc.): [https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg[/img])
* It pays out a generous dividend from the sale of call options, at an amount that is competitive with bond funds: [7.71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/nusi/dividend-history) 
* Although it has a higher expense ratio, it would be easier to buy this than try to build my own downside protection (e.g., buying protective puts), which can be a full time job. 

My goals would be to avoid inflation risk and have reasonable returns without a large drawdown.

I had two questions:

1. What might be the risks with buying this ETF?
2. What would the tax treatment be when the stocks they trade have protective puts on them? I believe it resets the clock on capital gains. Are those taxes deducted by the fund manager from the overall returns or does it get paid by the holder when the 1099 is distributed?

t3_ge63g1,investing,"What portfolio analysis tools -- looking for robust, flexible analysis (without hand entering data)","I'd like to be able to do custom analyses on my overall portfolio.  Unfortunately, my brokerage account is with Fidelity and their options for customized analysis are, imho, painfully feeble and cumbersome.  For example, if I want to look at a spreadsheet that includes TTM dividends paid, TTM earnings, beta, etc., I have to *look each one up and manually enter all of those data by hand* for every stock.  

I'd like something more robust and, more importantly, with automated data entry.

t3_ge5k0q,investing,Do you believe it is possible to determine a company's market value by just reading their financial statements?,"Most of us have heard that many great investors, such as Warren Buffett, love to read company's annual reports all day long. 

&gt; Warren Buffett has said he loves to curl up with companies’ annual reports. When asked how to get smarter, Buffett once held up stacks of paper and said he “read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.” 

&gt; Once Buffett determines the intrinsic value of the company as a whole, he compares it to its current market capitalization—the current total worth or price. If his intrinsic value measurement is at least 25% higher than the company's market capitalization, Buffett sees the company as one that has value.

That being said,  I've found some great (IMO) financial statements of a company that is somehow undervalued by investors.  I know some would argue it is important to know  the company business, competitors, etc. And I agree.

However, I would like to make an ""experiment"", and let you see first the numbers, without knowing nothing about the company. And then see if we're biased depending on countries/sectors/ethics,etc.

If you find this post interesting I will give you the name of company, so we can discuss the results after reading your unbiased value estimates.

t3_ge41ef,investing,Viable options strategy?,"So I’ve been looking at options and thinking about different strategies, and I was wondering if this one was viable. 

It’s similar to a synthetic long where you buy a call and sell a put except that they are not for the same strike price or expiry. You would buy an OTM call for a short expiry and sell a put for a OTM somewhat further out expiry.

The sale of the put pays for the call. This means that profits are realized at or below the strike price. So even if the stock doesn’t move upward you are at least breaking even. This eliminates the risk of loss due to sideways price movement.

This of course does increase risk if the stock price were to fall, but depending on the circumstances there may be a low probability of that happening. 

For example, let’s say you thought EURN was going to have an excellent earnings announcement. EURN is currently at $10 posting earnings 5/7. You can buy a $12.5 Call for $0.38 for 5/15 expiry. You can sell a $5 Put for $0.40 for 8/21 expiry. So you are overall ITM upon executing. Your total possible risk is $480 if the stock falls to $0, but the likelihood of losing money at all is extremely low because EURN hasn’t been less than $7 since 2013. If your bet pays off, you could even buy out the put contract if it was making you nervous due to the longer expiry and it should be cheaper at that point.

&gt; 
&gt; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is suing Uber and Lyft, alleging the ride sharing companies have misclassified their drivers as contractors. City attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego have joined Becerra in the lawsuit.
&gt; 
&gt; The lawsuit gets to the heart of a recent debate between gig economy companies and California officials. The lawsuit is based on a California law that went into effect earlier this year, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5). Uber, Lyft and other companies opposed the law, which was created as a way to require gig economy companies to classify their drivers as employees, rather than contractors. The companies have said the law strips workers of flexibility in work that they enjoy, while government officials backing the bill say it affords workers key benefits they are otherwise denied as contractors.
&gt; 
&gt; “Uber and Lyft claim that properly classifying drivers as employees is incompatible with flexibility. That is a lie,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. “There is no legal reason why Uber and Lyft can’t have a vast pool of employees who decide for themselves when and where they work – exactly as drivers do now. These companies simply don’t want to do it.”
&gt; 
&gt; The plaintiffs are seeking and injunction on the alleged misclassification and restitution for workers and civil penalties that could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the lawsuit.","[CNBC] California Attorney General and cities sue Uber and Lyft, alleging they misclassified workers as contractorshttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/05/california-ag-cities-sue-uber-and-lyft-over-worker-classification.html

t3_ge2x0n,investing,"Aside from some speculation, I actually think the market is being fairly rational","There are a lot of people saying that the market should be going down right now. I used to be one of them, but I've backed out of that hypothesis. Now, I think the market is pretty well priced (aside from a few speculative cases). Here are my thoughts on that.

1. The companies with the biggest exposure to COVID-19 have already gone down in price. Airlines, cruise companies, hotels, casinos, oil etc. 
2. The companies that are going up in price mostly have good balance sheets or corporate debt options to cover 6+ months of operating expenses. Big oil companies are probably the best suited to weather this storm as they always carry a lot of cash to weather low oil price storms. 
3. Most companies without direct exposure to COVID-19 have a smaller market cap today than they did 3 months ago. Indicating an already expected lower cash flow for the foreseeable future due to recession. Q2-Q4 earnings will be trash, and that is mostly expected.
4. The affects of the virus and economic impact of a second wave has mostly been priced in to stock prices. Just because we get bad news about another wave or that we'll be in recession isn't going to affect stock prices much.
5. The initial affects and expected secondary effects of the recession have mostly been priced in. We all know there will be big layoffs in the coming months. 
6. Financial systems have been stabilized by the fed so the risk of financial institutions going belly up is pretty low. 

I know we hate to say it's all ""priced in"", but I can't find a good example a slow recovery isn't priced in. It seems like most stocks are expecting a slow 2020 with a pickup in 2021. That, to me, seems pretty reasonable. A early 2021 vaccine isn't guaranteed, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that we'll have news (either successful or indications that a vaccine is very close) for a vaccine late this year. Even if a vaccine hasn't been produced, we'll be looking at herd immunity in a few key areas. 

Some thing that may not be priced in right now, but are not guaranteed to happen (hence expecting them to happen is speculation).

1. An exceptionally long (2+ years) time before a vaccine is discovered. 
2. A very short immunity after being infected (only 1 year of immunity before getting reinfected). 
3. Second wave in China. 
4. A particularly brutal second wave in the USA.
5. Financial system collapse.
6. Particularly extensive depression heavily affecting large companies.
7. A swing left in politics hitting the cash value of big businesses. Biggest effect could be a halt in M&amp;A or serious anti-trust laws breaking up FAANG companies. 
8. Mid-Long term fossil fuel demand collapse.
9. Bankruptcies of publicly traded companies. I think this will cause the next bear market, but it's months away. There is still runway for companies with shitty balance sheets. And who's to say the fed won't step in to buy up shitty of shit junk bonds. 

In other words, most of the obvious stuff has been priced in.

With all that said, there is definitely quite a bit of speculation going on. Tesla and Amazon are the two biggest examples. Their stock price right now is expecting them to make 5-10x their current revenue. It's not inconceivable, but IMO it's very bullish on a 5 year timescale. Another example, USO seems to be bought up by retail investors pushing up oil prices speculating that oil demand will return this summer (and there won't be a second wave crashing prices again). If that's the case, we'll see the price of oil collapse again when the June contracts expire. 

So I don't expect a bull or bear market in the coming months. More of a sideways market.","Aside from some speculation, I actually think the market is being fairly rationalThere are a lot of people saying that the market should be going down right now.

Also it's less than fifth of the price of all time high. All relevant news headlines are negative which I assume is making this stock tank even more making this a potentially really profitable investment in the long term when things ease down.

Obviously the risk is bankruptcy. Compared to Southwest or Delta their fundamentals are pretty shit. High debt burden, low profit margins. They're burning over 50 million in cash a day.

They got the biggest loan and a grant from the government in the recent aid. And they're the biggest airline with over 100k employees (also with America in their name lol) which makes me think the fed will help them if shits hits the fan and they become really close to bankruptcy. I know they declared bankruptcy before but I believe this time government intervention is more likely due to the damage being caused by the corona.

I've also been considering selling my current stakes in them and just buying Southwest or Delta which seem to have much better financials and fundamentals to survive this crisis, but potentially less % gains post recovery. 

What do you guys think?","[AAL] American Airlines' risk of bankruptcy.So I bought a handful of AAL stocks in this recent low because it's pretty close to all time low.

t3_gdznhz,investing,The safety of muni bonds when states' tax base is affected,"With the looming recession (if we aren't in it already), States' income  streams are going to be hit on both the income tax and sales tax fronts.  Some states are obviously in a better position than others (e.g. CA which has been running a budget surplus for a few years, whereas NY is cash strapped), but at what point does paying the bond obligations become an issue?  

Even if state gov'ts are well capitalized, some are issued by counties and backed by property taxes.  Using CMF as an example ""State Tax-Backed"" bonds form only ~30% of the portfolio.

Pair that with gov't likely issuing newer bonds to fund increased expenses brought on by Covid*, I don't see a case to hold muni bonds for the time being.  They've recovered a lot since the Fed provided the backstop.  

So, does it make sense to sell while things before more bad news comes?

Revenues from that segment were up 5% year over year in the first quarter, even with the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and that increase followed 8.7% growth in the fourth quarter. \[The Motley Fool\]

“The public clouds do extraordinary things and they’re great partners of ours, but their primary business is creating these homogeneous services, at massive volumes, and saying ‘if your workloads fit into this, we can run it better, faster, cheaper etc.’ And they have obviously expanded out. They’ve added services. They are not saying we can put a box on-premise, but you’re still fitting into their model.” - IBM's President Jim Whitehurst

On the news side, IBM is launching new services to automate business planning, budgeting and forecasting, for example, as well as new AI-driven tools for building and running automation apps that can handle routine tasks either autonomously or with the help of a human counterpart. The company is also launching new tools for call-center automation. \[TC\]

Clearly the current $660 stock price reflects enormous long-term positivity, but will the short-term results prove that the stock price is moving too fast?

t3_gdlncx,investing,Competitive prospects of companies like airlines that have taken on massive debt,"With Buffett selling his airline stocks and what is going on with other firms getting bailouts I am still very puzzled by something I am not seeing being discussed in a macro sense.

How are these firms with huge debt going to compete? In the case of airlines discount competitors were popping up all the time. If the same holds true post recession (or whatever it becomes) the existing players will basically be completely underwater on their assets and their debt. Boeing could now be making deals to produce planes for players that don't need to pay crews or maintainance until after this is over. Everything suggests they will face stiffer competition post recession.

In short I see firms like this being made uncompetative by the cost of servicing their debt - there will be competitors who lack these problems. The barriers to entry (asset prices, gate access fees) will also be reduced by this situation.

The same thing goes for other sectors. How is this debt not been seen as lethal to the firm's taking it on?","Competitive prospects of companies like airlines that have taken on massive debtWith Buffett selling his airline stocks and what is going on with other firms getting bailouts I am still very puzzled by something I am not seeing being discussed in a macro sense.

t3_gdjhpc,investing,Rate these 2 Portfolios: Actively managed vs Passively managed,"Hello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs. I've done quite a bit of research and arrived at these portfolios for long term dividend growth + yield.  I have a pretty long investment time horizon so there's essentially no bonds. I live in Canada, and like to take advantage of tax benefits such as the Canadian Dividend Tax Credit, which is why my portfolio is Canadian focused.

Due to recent events and quantitative easing by the Fed, I am worried about the stock market trading sideways for a long time similar to the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Therefore, I believe a dividend/yield focused portfolio provides a steady source of growth in the absence of capital appreciation.

One of these portfolios seeks higher yield using actively managed strategies (such as artificial intelligence via HAL.TO), while the other portfolio seeks to minimize MER. I will list them below and briefly explain my rationale:

# Portfolio 1 (Actively Managed):

* CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (RIT.TO) - 40% allocation
* Horizons Canadian Active Dividend ETF (HAL.TO) - 30% allocation
* BMO Global High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.717%

**Rationale:**

I know the management fee is high, but if you check the annualized performance since inception of RIT.TO and HAL.TO, they are 9.20% and 7.27%. I know passive management generally beats active management, but in this case it might be different. Real estate is generally a sector where active management can provide more value than in stocks, due to more inefficiencies to exploit. HAL.TO uses artificial intelligence and big data to predict dividend yield and sustainability, which seemed to have provided superior returns so far.

Plus, the real estate market might be in big trouble, so the active management of RIT.TO might be useful to implement proactive/defensive plays. It's also interesting HAL.TO positioned it's allocation to utilities as its top sector allocation, since utilities tend to perform the best during a market downturn.

In terms of BMO covered call ETF, I see it as a pseudo-bond that provides good yield even in economic downturns. I chose ZWG.TO because it is geographically diversified compared to the other BMO covered call ETFs. I've heard good things about ZWH.TO (USA only), because the covered call premiums are higher in the US (though ZWG.TO is almost 60% US).

# Portfolio 2 (Passively Managed):

* Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO) - 40% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV.TO) - 30% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Global Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.258%

**Rationale:**

These are the lowest fee ETFs I could find compared to similar competition. I personally really like REITs which is why I am so heavy in real estate, and VRE.TO is the cheapest compared to other REIT etfs like XRE.TO and ZRE.TO. I also like the MSCI High Dividend Yield Indices that XDIV.TO and XDG.TO tracks, which uses smart beta methods (Tangerine's high dividend mutual fund also tracks this index).

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate all feedback, looking forward to learn from you all, thanks.","Rate these 2 Portfolios: Actively managed vs Passively managedHello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs.

I’ve got some great feedback from a lot of people but the negative comments and the small number of upvotes this post got opened my eyes and made me realize, unfortunately, it’s not worth my time or effort to share my trades.

I don’t need clout or anything so I’m going back to lurking and investing in private.

We have less informative post getting multiples higher upvotes and more positive comments.

I’ve decided to not post the rest of my stock picks. I’ll share the gain porn when I look to sell my positions

Best of luck guys","ASR, Undervalued Stock #1Over the next week, I will be sharing all the stocks I bought and why starting with my smallest position and leading to my largest position.

&amp;#x200B;

This company was found using my proprietary discounted cash flow application I coded for my master's thesis/project.

&amp;#x200B;

Ticker: ASR

Industry Group: Transportation

&amp;#x200B;

Brief Description: Operates, maintains, and develops airports in the southeast region of Mexico (tourist destinations)

&amp;#x200B;

Intrinsic Stock Price: $148.95

&amp;#x200B;

Notable Profitability Ratios:

27.6% Profit Margin, 21% Net Operating Profit Margin

&amp;#x200B;

Notable Productivity Ratios:

3 AR Turnover, 8.3 AP Turnover, 8.7 PPE Turnover

&amp;#x200B;

Notable Leverage Ratios:

Lower than average leverage at 1.8

&amp;#x200B;

Notable Liquidity Ratios:

3 Current, 3 Quick

&amp;#x200B;

Airlines will be affected for ""13 to 26 months"". Taking the current situation into account, liquidity ratios are more important than ever when evaluating transportation companies. I found great security knowing that ASR has enough cash to cover its yearly obligations 3 times over (Quick Ratio).

&amp;#x200B;

On top of strong fundamentals, ASR also offers a 5.3% dividend

&amp;#x200B;

I have included the assumptions of the algorithm and the revenue forecast If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

t3_gdgkmg,investing,Stock Data into Spreadsheets,"Hi all,

I'm wondering what r/investing likes for pulling stock data into spreadsheets. For the purposes of number crunching and looking at trends, subsegments, etc - I've got a lot of time on my hands and am looking to play around to see if there's anything interesting to come upon! I was hoping to see how it can be pulled into a spreadsheet. Google sheets seems to be an option. I'm a bit partial to Excel and Google seems limited as to the fields that can be drawn. Another option is through other web systems (Morningstar, my brokerage, etc) but they don't allow the manual sorts of things I'd want to look at.

Cheers and thank a bunch!","Stock Data into SpreadsheetsHi all,

But that sentiment conflicts with the stats.

At the start of the pandemic panic in the states, The federal reserve was Buying $75 Billion in treasuries per day.

As you can see from the link above, this has been significantly wound down throughout April. By mid April they were down to $30 Billion per day, and now, they're only planning to buy $8 Billion in treasuries per day.","The Federal Reserve Has Been Significantly Winding Down It's Treasury Purchaseshttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details

t3_gd82oc,investing,My stock study watchlist. would appreciate criticisms or red flags,"**Core**

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion.

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product.

\- Visa

They make a ton of money on transactions. I saw them hiring for blockchain development so it leads me to believe that they're adapting.

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

t3_gd7hyk,investing,daily swims during crash/historical data,"I'm sure the landslide from Feb 20 - March 23 this year is still fresh in everyone's mind. 

I sat that one out because i was still working during that time and knew even less about stocks/trading than I do now(still new to this and learning), but I saw the profits you can make by buying puts at the right time. 

one of the strategy I saw some people using during that time was buy puts on the green days and take profit immediately the day after. I still remember the market was ""predicable"" in the sense that everybody know it's crashing, and those greens days are almost guarantee to be followed with bloodbath red days after. That pattern repeated over the course of bit over 3 weeks.

Now my question is : is this a common characteristic for a steep market drop? I'm only taking about the big plunge here. In the past historical charts when you see the market take a nose dive, it's basically a straight line heading down, but I can imagine it wont red days for weeks straight, it will probably have some strong green days mix with every 2/4 red days?

t3_gd2xcj,investing,Market Movers,"Last week was mixed with positive and negative drivers for the market, but it closed with a devastating statement by Warren Buffett that will likely drag down next week's markets: ""The world has changed...and I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way"".

Here are the details:

Better than expected earnings reports from tech and airline companies. This week began with strong earnings reports by Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), United Airlines (UAL), and others, demonstrating that analyst expectations for COVID-19's impact on the markets were overstated. Markets rallied on these strong earnings reports.

Gilead (GILD) announced a successful COVID-19 treatment and is making it widely available for free. Mid-week, GILD announced a successful phase 3 trial for remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir's ability to reduce hospital stays to &lt;2 weeks for over 50% of patients. The drug gained FDA approval for emergency use and will be available to COVID-19 patients for free beginning next week. This event was another positive driver in the markets last week. 

Amazon (AMZN) profits dip due to coronavirus response, even though revenue grew by 27% since last year, disappointing investors. AMZN share price decreased by \~8% from the beginning of the weak as it posted earnings 20% lower than analyst expectations. Bezos told investors that the increase in expenses were from spending millions on developing COVID-19 tests to test all its employees and implementing enhanced cleaning techniques to prevent COVID-19 spread.

Warren Buffett sells all airline shares as he is uncertain what society will be like coming out of COVID-19. Warren Buffett announced he sold all his airline shares because he is uncertain about society after the COVID-19 crisis. Buffett stated with uncertainty, “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” This announcement may have a rippling effect on the market as many investors deem Buffett as an ""oracle,"" able to see the future of markets.

Overall, I’m optimistic about the economic recovery once stay-at-home declarations have been lifted. Protests across the country indicate unrest that is associated with lack of employment and the inability to move freely. Gilead's remdesivir brings a sense of security to economic opening as it may save many at-risk, severe patients from death. The virus is a transient event that will leave as quickly as it came.","Market MoversLast week was mixed with positive and negative drivers for the market, but it closed with a devastating statement by Warren Buffett that will likely drag down next week's markets: ""The world has changed...and I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way"".

t3_gd0iyp,investing,Why I think $opk will double in the next few weeks," Before I lay out a BUY thesis, let me first address the negativity:

* ""It's a penny stock"" - No it's not. The last closing price is $2.13 with a market cap of $1.43b. Widely spoken $nat ($6/share) here is under a billy.
* ""It's a pump and dump"" - No it's not. 39.85% insiders + 26.36% institutional holdings. You should realize that when dumb money from Robinhood follows anything in \~$1bil range, it's gonna move prices temporarily.
* ""The CEO was caught for pump &amp; dump"" - Sure, but not really. The CEO is an old Pharma billionaire. All the previous pharma companies he touched turned into gold.

t3_gcz72i,investing,Could The Markets Go Down With No Chance Of Recovery?,"I get the mantra of, ""If we have a recession, all you have to do if you have a diversified portfolio (like an index based ETF) is just wait about 24/36 months, you'll then have all your money back, and everything else form there will be profit again!"" 

This has essentially been true for going on a century now, and this has also been true in most real estate markets in the U.S. . For some reason, I'm starting to think that won't remain true.     I could be wrong folks, but there's something in my gut that says the future is going to be a lot worse in terms of making general market investment gains compared to what they have been over the past 50-75 years.  My reasons are based on the following, 

1. We have way too much debt.  I don't need to tell you this, but our debt to GDP is over 100% and rising fast.  With this virus and trillions in stimulus/bailout money, it's bound to get a lot worse.  Not only that, this country is saturated with person debt I.E. student loans, credit cards, and loans up the ying-yang 

2. People aren't having nearly as many kids as they used to.  In fact I'm a typical example of a male millennial that has no desire to try and raise a child. 

3. The U.S. is becoming too unstable of a society due to political problems I.E. corruption at all levels of government even at the state, city, and local levels.  

&amp;#x200B;

4. This virus just made this whole situation a lot worse, but it might have been bound to happen eventually anyway.  The virus though is very unpredictable.  Even **Warren Buffet** was saying he is pulling out of airlines.    


What I'm saying is the market could go down, and it might not recover for DECADES!  If you think that's impossible look at Japan.  Their stock market capped out in the late 1980s and to this day they have never fully recovered the losses!  The reason being is Japan is saturated with debt, and the population there hasn't increased much at all.    

&amp;#x200B;

I know what a lot of you are thinking, ""Well Japan is just a small island compared to the U.S."" I get that, but I don't think that it can't happen here.  In fact, I think it could happen within the next 10 years easily if it's not happening already.  So to make a long story short,  the mantra of: ""All you have to diversify in something like an index based fund and if you wait long it'll always go up more if it goes down as long as you can just wait about 2-5 years tops is not necessarily true!   There  are no guarantees like that.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I'm still in the market a little bit right now.  So I'm as confused as everyone else.  Does what I'm saying here have potential merit though?  Could we have a future like Japan now circa 1989?","Could The Markets Go Down With No Chance Of Recovery?I get the mantra of, ""If we have a recession, all you have to do if you have a diversified portfolio (like an index based ETF) is just wait about 24/36 months, you'll then have all your money back, and everything else form there will be profit again!""

t3_gcv79c,investing,Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator is Kinda Wrong. More like incomplete,"Over the past few days I’ve encountered several articles mentioning the Buffett indicator and how it’s flashing red, signaling dire times ahead. For those of you that don’t know, the Buffett indicator tells investors whether the stock market as a whole is overvalued relative to GNP or not. For the past few months and years, it has been signalling that the stock market is deadly overpriced, reaching significantly higher than the Great Financial Crisis in the past few months. I think it’s missing one piece of information that makes it seem slightly more worse than it seems.

The Buffett indicator is simply the Total Stock Market Capitalization/Gross National Product (GNP). GNP is quite similar to GDP, with net property income from abroad added to the mix. For the US, this doesn’t add much of anything, only about a 1-2% change from GDP.  The more interesting part is the market capitalization of the stock market. In the US it is usually measured by the Wilshire 5000 Full Cap Price Index or a similar all-encompassing index. 

[https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php). 

In the link above, you’ll see that the Buffett Indicator is currently at around 132% (as of the time of writing this). This nets it a value above 120% - which is meant to be the “significantly overpriced” territory. Looking at the chart provided in the link, we see that the market has been in that significantly overpriced territory since the start of 2017 and has continuously risen until the coronavirus led market crash. 

As explained in the link, the lines in this calculation are drawn around a one to one ratio between market capitalization and GNP. I’d like to note here the underlying assumption behind the indicator: The real value of the market capitalization should be around the same size of GDP.  This assumption, as far as I can tell, doesn’t hold any meaning over the long term. 

Think about it, this means that the value of the stock market should always stay constant with respect to the size of the economy. How could that be true, when the companies represented in the stock market have been growing their international customer bases while the rest of the economy hasn’t, meaning their growth relative compared to the stock market companies' growth is smaller. Shouldn’t we expect that over time, especially over the past 10 years with the widespread use of the internet, large companies have grown beyond their usual reach and come to represent a larger chunk of GDP than they used to?

To verify this claim, one would need to get their hands on data that shows the contributions of companies represented in the stock market to overall GNP. If there is a rise in that value as I suspect there is, this would mean that the Buffett Indicator needs to be modified by using the total contribution to GNP by stock market companies instead of GNP directly. 

I’d like to note that I have no idea if what I suggest here is true, or if I'm missing something blatantly obvious. But to me it stands clear that there should be a coefficient associated with this indicator that represents the relative size of stock market contributions to GNP vs GNP itself. Otherwise, the underlying assumption is too heavy to hold true over long periods of time. With that said, the actual value of the Buffett indicator should be significantly lower than it is today, to reflect the rise in stock market generated GDP over the past 10 years.","Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator is Kinda Wrong.

In the link above, you’ll see that the Buffett Indicator is currently at around 132% (as of the time of writing this). This nets it a value above 120% - which is meant to be the “significantly overpriced” territory. Looking at the chart provided in the link, we see that the market has been in that significantly overpriced territory since the start of 2017 and has continuously risen until the coronavirus led market crash. 

As explained in the link, the lines in this calculation are drawn around a one to one ratio between market capitalization and GNP. I’d like to note here the underlying assumption behind the indicator: The real value of the market capitalization should be around the same size of GDP.  This assumption, as far as I can tell, doesn’t hold any meaning over the long term. 

Think about it, this means that the value of the stock market should always stay constant with respect to the size of the economy. How could that be true, when the companies represented in the stock market have been growing their international customer bases while the rest of the economy hasn’t, meaning their growth relative compared to the stock market companies' growth is smaller. Shouldn’t we expect that over time, especially over the past 10 years with the widespread use of the internet, large companies have grown beyond their usual reach and come to represent a larger chunk of GDP than they used to?

To verify this claim, one would need to get their hands on data that shows the contributions of companies represented in the stock market to overall GNP. If there is a rise in that value as I suspect there is, this would mean that the Buffett Indicator needs to be modified by using the total contribution to GNP by stock market companies instead of GNP directly. 

I’d like to note that I have no idea if what I suggest here is true, or if I'm missing something blatantly obvious. But to me it stands clear that there should be a coefficient associated with this indicator that represents the relative size of stock market contributions to GNP vs GNP itself. Otherwise, the underlying assumption is too heavy to hold true over long periods of time. With that said, the actual value of the Buffett indicator should be significantly lower than it is today, to reflect the rise in stock market generated GDP over the past 10 years.",0,warren buffett favorite wrong incompleteover past several article mentioning buffett flashing signaling time buffett tell investor whether stock market whole relative gnp past month year signalling stock market reaching significantly higher great financial crisis past month missing one piece information make seem slightly worse seems buffett simply total stock market capitalization gross national gnp gnp quite similar gdp net property income mix u much anything change gdp interesting part market capitalization stock market u usually wilshire full cap price similar encompassing link buffett currently time writing net value meant significantly territory looking chart link market significantly territory since start continuously risen coronavirus market crash link line calculation one one ratio market capitalization gnp note assumption real value market capitalization size gdp assumption far tell meaning long term mean value stock market always stay constant respect size economy true company stock market growing international customer base rest economy meaning growth relative stock market company growth smaller expect time especially past year use internet large company grown usual reach represent larger chunk gdp verify claim one show contribution company stock market overall gnp rise value suspect mean buffett using total contribution gnp stock market company gnp note suggest true missing something blatantly obvious clear coefficient represents relative size stock market contribution gnp v gnp otherwise assumption heavy true long time actual value buffett significantly lower reflect rise stock market gdp past year

So if a buyer of a CDS has the ""spread"" on the CDS tighten that means that they would be paying the seller of the CDS less of a premium, but the CDS asset itself would be depreciate in value since default of the underlying asset is less likely. Then on the flip side if the CDS spread widens then the buyer is paying a higher premium to the seller, but the underlying asset of the CDS is more likely to default and the CDS becomes more valuable to the buyer. In that case the seller would ideally like to redeem (buy back) the CDS so they don't have to pay out in the underlying asset actually defaults.

t3_gck158,investing,"The theory behind CapEx, Buybacks, and Dividends","I’ve seen a lot of posts recently about buyback and dividends, especially about the discussion of buybacks in the media, so I figured I’d explain some of the theory, or at least how I learned it, behind the signals they are meant to give investors when used by a company. 

Assume a company has extra cash: they have 3 options with how they can spend it depending on how they view the company, the industry they’re in, and how the market is valuing the company (technically 4 with debt repayment, but that doesn’t really drive shareholder value). 

If they think there’s a lot of growth potential they’ll use that money on CapEx, M&amp;A, R&amp;D, and other things to help the company grow. This signals they think they can grow investors money more than those investors could elsewhere. If they have more cash, or don’t see as much growth in their industry they might turn to share buybacks or dividends. 

Dividends are a signal that they think investors can create a greater return elsewhere than they can in the company (or at least are giving them the option to chose if they can since you can always reinvest) [aside, but this is why you may want to be cautious of investing in companies with high dividend payout ratios since they’re literally telling you you have better options]. 

Buybacks signal the opposite, they are the company telling the market “You aren’t seeing our value, so the best thing we can do for our investors is buy ourself since we’re so cheap”. Theoretically a company would do this only until they though they were getting a good deal. 

The commentary is then for all these companies doing large scale buybacks, “Did they actually think their best option was to invest in the company, or were they just buying back shares to inflate share prices more?” That’s a really hard to answer since the company technically knows better than us how they’re valued, but it’s also kinda shady when companies are systematically buying back shares every year at peak multiples. 

This all being said, if a company is buying back shares during a huge down market it’s a good sign they’re undervalued.

personally i do not think that we will see another sell off until Q3

Q3 is the only earnings that can possibly surprise investors, everyone already knows that Q2 will probably be one of the worst earnings reports in the history of the stock market

what no one expects is earnings to be bad for Q3, everyone thinks a rebound will happen with positive earnings and well be set in an official bull market after Q3

because of this im fully bullish up until right before earnings of the big companies

i will be buying at lows for any company expecting a bounce up for everything, sure we might see some sideways trading or even small dips but i do NOT think that we will touch March lows until Q3 and that is ONLY if we have a bad Q3 earnings

think about this how you want, but all the signs are there

J. Powell literally said they have enough money to prop the market up for at minimum a year and they will do anything and everything in their power to keep the economy up

If you all have your bias' towards a bear sell off then fine everyone has their reasons

but thinking about ""where were supposed to be"" is a great indication of where the market is going.

everyone keeps thinking that we should be at ATLs right now because of unemployment and business' shutting down, but if we were gonna be there we should've been there by now

my best advice, buy at weekly lows for any company and hold and then just dollar cost average if it dips

were going to hit SPY 300 faster than everyone thinks and once we pass that threshold we might test it again as support but i really think were more than likely gonna keep going up

A lot of investors (particularly buy-and-hold ones) believe ""selling at a loss"" is a sign of defeat and that loss realization is somehow detrimental to their long-term earnings, and that eventually things will go back up to break-even.

This leads investors not to fundamentally reassess the opportunity costs of what they hold, holding and hoping they can break even... someday. Only when things are to a bleak point where they are trying to salvage anything they can do they sell.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Japanese national, but have lived internationally as a third culture kid (TCK) in Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, Holland and now in the UK. I've done as much research as I can on investing and to what I've gathered, and what would suit my personal goals is to invest without much risk and buy one index at a time. To be more specific I can only save about 500£ per month, and intend to spend every 6 months (=3000£) on ETFs. Let me know what you guys think of this strategy, Im open for any discussion. It seems like the popular belief is to invest sooner than later if I intend a kind of couch-potato/hands-off approach to my investing.  


Secondly, I'd like to invest in Singapore's DBS Vickers to get their ETFs (they allow trading in Singapore, Canada (not taxed unlike USA), Hong Kong and US (doubt I'll touch that stock market since not sure about being taxed)), which is one of the few ways I can as a Japanese National (restrictions apply in Internaxx (Luxembourg), Swissquote (Switzerland) and Saxo Capital Markets and Interactive Brokers (didn't like reviews on their customer service)). Does anyone know anything more specifically about being an expat and dealing with offshore brokerage? DBS trading commission is 28S$ and hence my reason to save up 3000£ (= 5308.60S$ which means I lose like 0.5% per trade), is this still smart? Any thoughts? Really just a beginner here, I'm just a bit of a book vacuum and may have overinformed myself, would be nice to hear any real-world experiences. Even in general with offshore brokerage and investing in small amounts every half year.

t3_gce9bg,investing,Another global conflict is more likely than most realize,"COVID-19 will have lasting effects geopolitically. In particular, China and the East Asian pacific. The pandemic has worsened already frayed relations between China and the US. This will accelerate manufacturing outside of China, but this was going to happen anyway as China transitions to a service economy. However, the US and other countries are taking provocative actions by supporting Taiwanese independence, probably to distract their population from their own failures at home in containing the outbreak. China has made it clear that Taiwanese independence will trigger an invasion from the mainland. This is not surprising since Taiwan is essentially China's Cuba, and any hostile nation so close to the mainland is a huge national security threat for them. 

I don't rule out the possibility of U.S. formally recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation; in fact the Trump administration is so edgy that I think this is likely if he gets a second turn. If Taiwan declares independence, either by the U.S. formally recognizing them, or them declaring it themselves, mainland China will likely retaliate militarily and launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan.

The second possibility is severe economic sanctions on China. There has been some discussion of this at the political level, but this will not ""make China behave"" as some would think, but make China more aggressive militarily. This would be similar to the US oil embargo on Japan in the 1940s. An isolate country with a worsening economy will have no choice left but to launch all out war in order to keep legitimacy.

Some people say, since China has nukes that a U.S.-China hot war is impossible. However, I do not buy that. If you look at China's nuclear capabilities, they have nowhere near the capabilities of the U.S. or the Russians. China can nuke Japan and Hawaii but I doubt they will be able to nuke much of the U.S. Whereas U.S. has complete nuclear superiority over China and can nuke them several times over.

And that once demand returns to normal, businesses will continue to post record high profits. 

This idea couldn't be farther from the truth. [Data published in the WSJ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/) on March 10, 2020 showed that: 

* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. 
* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher. 
* [the IMF conducted a stress test](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/investing/corporate-debt-coronavirus/index.html) that showed an economic crises half the size of 2008 would put 40% of corporate debt at risk of default in the 8 of the largest world economies.

I find it very odd that stories like these were EVERYWHERE in March, 2020. Then as stocks began to skyrocket and firms started making back losses, they practically vanished from the media. 

If you are comfortable with these debt levels and believe we can keep increasing debt without a market contraction, then by all means continue to invest.

t3_gcawmd,investing,Thoughts on Equity Valuations and Why They Should Be Higher,"These are two primary reasons why I believe market P/E ratios have to be higher today than in the past. Comparing the P/E ratio of today and decades of the past is almost like comparing apples and oranges for the following reasons:

(1) **Free Put Option** is ignored by P/E ratios. When you buy the S&amp;P 500, you’re also getting an embedded put option provided by the Fed and US Treasury. If market conditions get worse, these entities will support risk assets through liquidity (Fed) and deficit spending (Treasury). This idea about the free put option has been around since 2009-2010, but it has been further qualified with recent actions. The repo market problems we saw in 2019 showed the Fed will step in even when stocks are at all-time highs! This put option has only increased in value since the GFC b/c the magnitude and frequency of support is very high. This put option won’t always exist, but should as long as fiat currency is accepted, the USD is the world reserve currency and the Fed’s measures of inflation don’t go meaningfully above 2.5% to 3%.

(2) **Free Cash Flow and Low LT Rates – Tech Wins**. The foundation of asset valuation is the value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows. When discounting future cash flows, the US 10-year has gone from 2-3% in recent years to 0.61% which increases the PV. You all know that. What a lot of people haven’t picked up on yet is free cash flow profiles differ substantially across industries and companies. If a company doesn’t generate much FCF, their firm valuation does not benefit from low long-term rates as much. Compare and contrast the cash flow statements of Exxon and Visa. Visa’s cash flow generation is nothing short of exceptional, and Exxon’s is poor. A lot of tech generates a ton of FCF and their P/E and EV/EBITDA valuations are very high, but I’d argue those aren’t really the best methods of valuing them because it doesn’t credit them for their best attributes, which is crazy cash flow generation. Discounted Cash Flow is the purest form of asset valuation.

Technology has become a very large part of the market today. These tech behemoths (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, V) generate crazy amounts of cash. Their cash flow statements are beautiful. A P/E ratio reflects accounting earnings, and does not measure true free cash flow which is the purest form of asset valuation. There may be a better example, but in 2019 XOM had $10.6B of Net Income and $5.3B of Free Cash Flow (Cash from Operations minus Capex). In 2018, V had $10.8B of Net Income (same as XOM in 2019) but had $12.2B of Free Cash Flow. There is a big difference and cash is king.

Question: The German 10-year Bund is -0.59%, so why aren’t European equities higher? Look at the composition of the European stock indexes – can you name any great European tech company? Maybe SAP? Dassault Systemes is basically the most US-like tech company in Europe and it stock has been great, but there is basically nothing else. Europe does have great pharma companies that generate cash flow but they all have very little growth. Europe has hardly any free cash flow growth and that is what low long-term rates love.

\#1. Free Cash Flow matters a lot more than EPS. #2. Growth in tech w/in the S&amp;P 500 has led to more cash flow generation than we’ve seen historically, so P/E should be higher. #3. Low interest rates benefit FCF generation through DCF models. Bottom line, traditional equity valuations are higher b/c of these market realities.","Thoughts on Equity Valuations and Why They Should Be HigherThese are two primary reasons why I believe market P/E ratios have to be higher today than in the past.

t3_gcaw94,investing,Airline stock strategy. I would like to hear your thoughts,"Here's my theory:

Major airlines are going for 1/3 of that they were usually going for.  UAL is going for $26.00 a share when it was going for $75 just a few months ago.

Let's say I have $30,000 to invest.  I put $10,000 into 3 different airlines:

10k in UAL, 10k in LUV, 10k in Delta.

Worst case scenerio 2 airlines go bk, but 1 goes back to it's original price.  That means I will totally break even and not lose anything.  (I can't see all 3 major US airlines going BK).  If anything, the remaining ones will eat up the other ones market share.

Medium case scenerio:  1 airline goes BK, the other 2 go back to their normal price.  In that case I made a decent profit.

t3_gc7scb,investing,Tanker stocks STNG vs NAT and Clean vs Crude,"
A lot of you are going to miss the boat on NAT (get it?). Here’s why:

Rates for shipping CLEAN product (refined gasoline, naphtha, jet fuel) are showing to be way more stable and are currently, insanely high vs DIRTY (crude oil) shipping rates. We are talking around 10x/day.

What does this mean? Crude oil shipping rates are still very high comparatively to last year, but are far below what clean rates are as of right now. 

Also, the fundamentals of NAT vs other tanker stocks just suck. There are far better options in the tanker world that will hold value better long term. NAT is among your worst options. 

The clean tanker stock that I think is poised to rally hard is $STNG. They have 42 LR2 ships in their fleet who are exposed to the most insane rates of all of the ship types currently. Their fleet is also modern and new. Refined products seemed to have backed up harder than crude meaning there is more need for storage on the water and shipment to terminal locations. It has dipped enough in the past week to make it a hell of a buy just before their earnings on 5/6. Q1 will be solid, but Q2 guidance should be
crazy appetizing as they are hopefully locking in these LR2 rates now.

I’m much more bullish on the tanker stocks with clean tankers. With that said, I am to the moon with STNG, long on EURN, DSSI and INSW.

EDIT: Lots of other variables at play here including the age of the fleets, order book for construction of new ships (hint: order book is very low so ship availability will become more scarce over time, good for rates) etc. Clean rates will most likely come down to lesser levels, but many experts seem to agree that the average rates for 2020 will be extremely good compared to recent years. STNG seems to be the play with lottery ticket upside and the others I listed are just fundamentally good stocks to buy and hold during this time.","Tanker stocks STNG vs NAT and Clean vs Crude

t3_gc5tfm,investing,Warren Buffet's Cash Pile Surges to Record $137 Billion,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. spent the first quarter building up cash as the coronavirus slowdown started to grip the U.S.

* Berkshire ended the period with $137 billion of cash, a record for the conglomerate. That was up almost $10 billion from the end of 2019, while the famed investor spent just a net $3.5 billion buying shares of his and other companies.

### Key Insights

* Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices.
* Buffett will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually on Saturday, starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
* Berkshire’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by unrealized losses in the massive stock portfolio.
* Berkshire bought $1.8 billion of stocks on a net basis in the period as the market plunged amid widespread fallout from Covid-19.
* Berkshire took a more cautious approach to stock buybacks in the first quarter, repurchasing just $1.7 billion. It spent a [record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-22/buffett-spends-record-2-2-billion-buying-up-berkshire-shares) $2.2 billion on buybacks during the last three months of 2019.

So The Fed is cutting interest rates and doing QE to encourage lending and trying to maintain liquidity in the credit market. This drives down the yeilds on basically everything. There was been a pretty consistent downward trend in 10Y Treasuries since 2001 (maybe even earlier?).

10Y Treasuries had 5% yields when folks were experiencing the 2008 crash.

if I buy a 100$ stock at a 4:1 leverage and it goes up by 10% on day one then it becomes 140$ I guess.
Then on day two it goes down by 20% so the 140$ become 60$ because of the 4:1 ratio
Does it work that way?

or is it so that if I buy at 100$ and after going up and down after a month it's gone up by 50% so at 4:1 leverage it's a 200$ increase?

what I mean is : does the leverage only take effect at the time of selling?

Because I don't like the risk of a company going bankrupt or a tweet causing it to crash 10% with my life savings, I'm going to go this route, and likely go with a mix of vt and vti at 1.4x margin.",0,margin google fellow investor finally put together long term plan much last couple month share note mistake please pm got bit simple path wealth book mutual vtsax vtwax equivalent etf vti vt respectively interactive broker allow margin etf year regular monthly contribution x margin never margin call much hope help goal play margin ratio margin etc risk company bankrupt tweet causing crash life saving route likely mix vt vti x margin
t3_gbzgi1,investing,There is a nuance to this...A primer on not being absolutely unequipped,"Hi All!

Honestly, I have no idea what I was thinking subbing to all of the major investing threads on Reddit. Now that I am more aware of what the landscape is, I would like to help. Honestly, no snarky shit.

It's not going to be a panacea, and this isn't going to immediately, read...immediately, help with your confusion. 

Ok, so, I get it, market is at recent lows and now you want to jump in. Smart. Well played...oh wait, this doesn't look like a 001 econ class chart, etc etc etc. I'm not here to beat you down. You were right to believe now is the time to buy, but all of the  crazy confusion can be a bit well, confusing. Also, if you feel like it, cross post this to whatever Tatooine-esque investing sub you like. It will save me some trouble.

1. Do not start investing in the hopes for short term gain on the backbone of a knowledge base that's as flimsy as jello. Seriously. I put this #1 because it should be the most over pronounced the few of us that are well versed should be repeating at all times, regardless of it not getting all the sexy upvotes of a market slander / confusion post...why?
2. Most people that make short term profits in this are lucky, or have extensive education, training, professional experience watching economic activity. Seriously. This is why I am putting this second. Joe regular, having whatever non-business / economics background is not on the same ground that people with a well versed background. On the internet, you're not going to be able to tell people apart immediately, and ""free"" advice is everywhere.
3. If you don't fall into #1 or #2, go long always. Invest in high quality firms with strong financials. Names you know. Make a buy, and sit on it forever or until you want to cash out. OR, pay a professional. There generally isn't a comfortable middle ground (sure, exceptions). Don't do this when the economy isn't on the news every night...do do this, if you can, when the economy is the forefront. Good news hardly makes nightly news, bad news always does. If your gut tells you that times are tough, but you have extra, that's when you should look into the bigger names...but this won't always work...why...
4. If you cannot lose as much as you put in, don't. Just don't. Even for the best of us this is a well placed bet. There is no guarantee. Stop. Invest in a 401k with a strong fiduciary. A well managed mutual fund. Please help yourself and do not start using an app that doesn't base itself on constant deposits and steady investment. Investing is good, within reason. Bad investing is essentially gambling addiction. Call the same number, talk to someone. There are prominent media figures right now, from fairly popular sports networks, just making click money on being bad at this. Those people can afford to loose money, a lot of people cannot. If you cannot, go long, go diversified, pay someone.
5. I cannot overstate how much experience matters. I was going to wrap this up, but it had to be said. If you failed out of math, economics, etc...just stop. Pay someone. Being able to watch a trend in real time isn't for everyone. Knowing economic indicators, geopolitics, and cyclical business schedules matters. In the short-term it matters a lot. I make money swing trading market trends, on top of playing standard long positions. I can do that because I can absorb a variety of information and know what to do with it. Seriously, 3 media inputs and flat numbers. I cannot overstate how much most people should make safe bets long.

And that's that, for now. I may cross-post on my own, but have just wanted to get that out. I'm sure it will get lost in the shuffle, but after everything I've read across multiple subs, I mean... why not.","There is a nuance to this...A primer on not being absolutely unequippedHi All!

I've been interested in investing on margin for awhile. My thought process has mainly been, I should get into real estate because I see everyone making tons of money on it, mainly due to leverage. But then it seems like a lot of work and there's the opportunity cost of the down payment that could be in the market and REITs could basically be the same. So I say well really what I want I think is to just make money off loans to make more money. 

Anyway I'm dabbling in trading a little extra in VTI on margin. Low enough that I shouldn't get margin called, but high enough to hopefully increase my return in the long run a bit.

Looking around for best places and the best I've found is M1 finance with 2% if I get M1 plus for $125 a year. Only other similar ones were interactive brokers. I'm hoping to do like &lt;10% (probably &lt;5% to start) of my NW.

&gt; Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

t3_gbmg4t,investing,New trader seeking advice. I took the time to write down my strategy. Please be harsh.,"I've been trading for about 3 months now, and really feel like I've found my calling.  I want to trade full time as a career eventually when I've built up enough capital.  
I've done a lot of due diligence and self-educating, and have formed some semblance of a strategy.  I've written down a list of rules that should never be broken, and that is the basis of my strategy.  I would love some feedback and advice from professionals.  I apologise in advance if I fail to use the proper terminology, or if I've posted in the wrong spot.  

1. Watch any stock with RSI 30 or less which is below both SMA20 &amp; SMA90.

2. Analyze the MACD to determine the momentum of a trend and the chance of reversal

3. Read the news to determine the stock isn't dead(filing for bankruptcy, about to be delisted, about to split, major scandal)

4. Take a position if the majority of analysts say to buy or hold.

5. Move into positions with an initial buy worth 0.5% of total portfolio value.
	
6. Aim for gains between 8-10% above avg price.  Once a stock price reaches 5% increase start to Set &amp; regularly maintain Stop Loss Sells to protect profits.

7. The maximum value of any position should not exceed 2% of your portfolios total value

8. First Double Down triggered @ 10% loss.  Stop Loss Sell @ 7% increase.  100+90=190÷2=95(avg price).  7% increase from 90 is 96.3
	
9. Second Double Down triggered @ 20% loss from first Double Down. Stop Loss Sell @ 17% increase. 100+90+72+72=334÷4=83.5(avg price).  17% increase from 72 is  84.2.
	
10. Final sell at a loss should be executed after 5% loss from second Double Down.

11. Dont touch anything that trades at a volume of less than 3 million.

12. Try to avoid holding positions over the weekend.  Even if you have to take a smaller gain or a shallow loss(1-3%) to get out before market hours on Friday, it is generally advantageous to do so.  (This rule is likely due to my own anxieties.  I'm happier when I have less money on the line during the weekend.  A lot of news can drop in that 2 day span between trading days.)

I've tried to set up these rules such that one follows the other (I wont be wasting my time reading news about the stock if it's trading above 30 RSI).  I am extremely conservative because I don't have a lot of capital and I desperately try to protect the small bit I do have(my initial investment was $500, and likely won't add more capital until after I've started working my regular job again).  I trade almost exclusively stocks listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or S&amp;P 500.  Sometimes I trade crypto, but only with extremely good indicators, as the extreme volatility scares me a little.  I stay the fuck away from options and futures.  I'm interested in the technicals of Forex, and am open to trading put options after I've sufficiently grown my account.

Please be as harsh as you can with your criticism without being unfair.  There is no room for feelings in this game, I know that.  I am trying to improve.

t3_gbm83s,investing,Gilead - a good investment? Phase III trials being expedited,"Gilead is promising.

I think the stock downturn today is mere facade with worries that this is not a ""cure"" or that the results were not the magic-bullet. I disagree. This medication will be prescribed everywhere as it reduced hospitalization by 1/3. Certainly more similar drugs will develop in due time but this is the first step. A Historic step.  That's a very important economic and healthcare space improvement. There was also a trend towards SS with overall survival and likely would have been met in larger numbers. With this all in mind and my own medical background, it appears obvious this is a good investment at least until the phase III publication.

This is the time to ride this wave. If the phase III results are published and lacking (doubt it) or a vaccine develops before the phase III publication, then jump ship. Gilead is the stock to hold for the next few months.

t3_gbkm8k,investing,What am I Missing?,"So, BLDR released earnings yesterday in which they beat EPS projections by 21.43%, sales by 20million, and had organic growth of a little over 3% outside of acquisitions. Now what confuses me is that it went down today. Was this purely driven by the market?? This is the way I see it: They had equivalent EPS from Q1 2019 to now this Q1 2020. Not only did they meet/beat earnings, but these weren’t adjusted earnings from the virus. BLDR has maintained and grown from quarters before the virus. So if the stock was at $28 before the crash, and is now at $17, with it beating earnings and increasing sales from the numbers posted BEFORE the virus, why is the value not $28 or higher. Essentially this earnings showed that they haven’t missed a beat since the virus started. The only counter I could possibly think of is anticipation of next quarters results being low due to real estate lending companies not funding new projects, thus making the supply for BLDR’s goods decrease. I have a hard time believing that the day after a 21% earnings beat, people are already trading in anticipation of the next quarters earnings. And I don’t want to hear “well the 50% gain over this last week is the earnings being priced in” the reason this doesn’t work for me is as I mentioned above. Based off sales and book value, the company is unchanged if not better than when it was trading at $28","What am I Missing?So, BLDR released earnings yesterday in which they beat EPS projections by 21.43%, sales by 20million, and had organic growth of a little over 3% outside of acquisitions.

t3_gbjltk,investing,"People who are looking for ""cheap"" stocks might consider IBM. They trade at 12x earnings, pay a ~5% dividend, and just acquired redhat recently","IBM has had basically flat (slight decline) revenues and profits for ~5 years, which is not quite the Tech stock headline we are used to seeing.  Market cap is 108bn today, revenues of 77bn in 2019, and earnings of 9.4bn. 

I feel they are integrated into so many business / government operations, that they will be reasonably well positioned during the covid crisis to continue to make money.  It is true that IBM will not be able to sell as many new services while its clients cost cut &amp; pause new investing. However IBM is a mature business - clients cannot easily switch products - and they will continue to earn from those.  

They are focused improving their hybrid cloud offerings and acquired redhat in July 2019 for 34bn, which at the time had growing earnings (3bn per year most recently), and growing revenues. Maybe IBM will screw up this trend, but hopefully not. Cloud provides some upside potential.

Even though we see some slight declines in earnings/revenues, IBM is still massively profitable, and I believe can eventually regain their footing through investment in R&amp;D or acquisition.  Having a lot of cash coming in is huge, because they can afford to make investments that many smaller contracting companies cannot.

IBM's global technology services (consulting, build, design, run) has been declining (9% YoY), which accounts for 60% of their revenue. However IBM is pretty well diversified in offerings, and will likely see other bets begin to offset this. Cloud is about 30% of their business and is growing at a 20% YoY rate.

IBM pays ~5.7Bn out in dividends of it's 9.7bn in earnings, so dividend is sustainable. I think for the price, IBM is a bargain.  It's not a trendy company, but it makes money and will continue to do so.

On the flip side, clear beneficiaries of the current upheaval are doing well. 

So while markets are not moving on real-time economic fundamentals, they are moving on reasonable judgements of fundamentals going forward

The Fed, for instance, is committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars of municipal bonds at favorable rates, which will mean that cash-strapped state governments should be able to retain teachers and policemen and programs

The Fed also is about to lend another $500 billion to Main Street businesses, which is coming too late to avoid the pain of the last month but will still matter greatly to the ability of companies to move forward and eventually rehire. The most visible effect of the money in motion now is the stock market, but that will be not the sole beneficiary as more Fed money flows to states and Main Street.

t3_gbj05i,investing,Crescita Therapeutics (CTX.TO) is your best bet for a Micro-Cap Healthcare Investment - Here is 5 reasons why.,"I've been mentioning this stock in a few threads recently, and a lot of people have asked why?   
A quick disclosure: I hold a medium size position in [CTX.TO](https://CTX.TO), purchased in mid-April at $0.47 per share. It currently sits at $0.70 per share, where I feel it still hold a lot of long term value.

* **Fundamentals are solid** \- P/E about 8 (ttm 5), P/S ans P/B under 0.5, D/E of 7. This is a company with almost no debt. They have 1.5M in debt, and over 9M in cash. 
* **Management are taking paycuts to maintain cash -** CEO, CFO, and other board members are taking paycuts up to 40% to help preserve cash. 
* **Jumping on the COVID help train -** CTX plans to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in May (oh hey, it's May now, look at that)
* **It's a penny stock that's actually low risk!? -** Yes! Penny stocks are notorious for having a high potential reward at a very high risk. It's easier for a stock to go from $0.10 to $0.20 than it is to go from $1000 to $2000. But it's much much much more likely that it goes to $0. Crescita Therapeutics  is a relatively new company, founded in 2016, that's already shown it knows how to function in the best and worst of times. They will not suffer long-term from the pandemic, as many penny stock companies and other micro-cap companies will.
* **It's an alternative industry in the sector at the moment -** Maybe you're getting tired of all the pot companies and COVID test stocks. Why not go with some beauty? When things start to return to some level of normalcy in the coming months/year, and COVID isn't the only thing in the news, stocks may drop. When people are working again, they may smoke less pot (but probably not, honestly). One thing is for sure though, people who buy beauty products, will still want to be beautiful, especially now that's they're going to see people again.","Crescita Therapeutics (CTX.TO) is your best bet for a Micro-Cap Healthcare Investment - Here is 5 reasons why.I've been mentioning this stock in a few threads recently, and a lot of people have asked why?

t3_gbitbe,investing,The case for shorting Intel.,"While Intel has had a great run over the past decade, I believe we've reached an inflection point. They've already had to start laying off employees: https://investorplace.com/2020/01/intel-layoffs-2020-things-to-know/

With AMD breathing down their back, Intel is lowering prices on their server chips lowering profit margins which won't be coming back anytime soon: https://www.anandtech.com/show/15405/intel-cuts-xeon-prices

Intel is constantly talking about how they're going to be shipping 7nm in 2021 when they have failed to get their 10nm process working for almost 4 years now past its original expected release date. It's clear Intel's process has stagnated, and their choice to stick with manufacturing their own CPUs has now turned from advantage to disadvantage as it's competitors are able to focus on design while leaving the process improvements to TSMC: https://www.pcworld.com/article/3394398/intel-commits-to-shipping-7nm-chips-by-2021-an-aggressive-change-of-pace.html

I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly. As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability.

Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

All of these are reasons why I believe Intel has largely peaked as a company, and my thesis for why Intel is a good stock to go short on right now.","The case for shorting Intel.While Intel has had a great run over the past decade, I believe we've reached an inflection point.

t3_gbbs8f,investing,How to Value Stock in a Time of COVID-19 (ELI5 Edition),"So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.

I would like to offer my explanation in regard to this. Since this is r/investing , i assume most of you guys have basic understanding in regard to FCF Valuation. But in case you don't know, it is pretty popular subject if you want to go deep down into fundamental investing. Some popular resources i would like to recommend is [Aswath Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), [Valuation by McKinsey](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/0470424656). Basically in FCF Valuation, you make an estimation in regard of future cash flow a company can generate in the future and discount it to the present time to arrive at the value of the business right now.

Since this is ELI5, i will not go into too much details. This is heavily dumbed down scenario, but i think it is enough to give you understanding.

Let's assume a **hypothetical company**. It is a good business with no debt, it has no risk of bankcruptcy in the near future.

Revenue = $1.000.000

Variable cost = 40% (this is the cost that incurred everytime you make a sale. Example : sales commision, product cost, delivery, etc.)

Fixed sot = $400.000 (this is the cost that incurred whether you make a sales or not. Example = Rent expense, salary, fixed assets depreciation, etc).

Net income = $200.000

The Value of the business is $2.000.000 (you can assume this is the market price, if someone actually want to buy the company).

For simplicity sake, we assume the net income is fully on cash-basis, so the net income also represent the free cash flow for the business. 

Assume that because of COVID-19, the revenue in 2020 will be down by as much as 50% and in 2021 will be down by 25%. It will go back to normal in 2022, so the terminal value or going forward it will go back to pre-covid value of $2.000.000

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
:--|:--:|:--:|--: |
Revenue | 500,000 | 750,000 | - |
Variable Cost| -200,000 | - 300,000 | - |
Gross Margin| 300,000 | 450,000 | - |
Fixed cost | -400,000 | -400,000 | - |
Net Income | -100,000 | 50,000 | - |
Terminal Value | - | - | 2,000,000 |
Discount factor* | 0.9090 | 0.8264 | 0.7513 |
Present Value | -90,909 | 41,332 | 1,502,629 |

*I use 10% Cost of capital. It is calculated simply by dividing 1/cost of capital^n . In this case 1/10%. This is pretty high as you might see, [a lot of business has lower cost of capital](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar). And lower cost of capital will result in higher present value.

If we sum all the present value (Net income/terminal value discounted into the present), it will arrive at $1,453,042, compared to previous value of $2,000,000. A 27% decrease in value, significant but arguably much more modest than many people would imagine.

Of course this is just hypothetical. But i would like to believe that my assumption is quite conservative. Like with the 10% cost of capital (even after the fed slash rate), or long U-shaped recovery. But if you try the FCF Valuation (the actual one, not this dumbed down version), you will see that the value will not go down as far as some bears like to believe. 

==========
**What we can take from this.**

Yes, time is bad and many good business will record very low or in fact negatives income this year. But this is not as doom and gloom as many people wanted to believe.

We see company like Adidas, Disney, Yum Brands penalized quite a bit because COVID, around the range of 25%-40%, depending on the timeline you are looking at, which is actually quite fair in regards to their future performances.

I knew at this point people have enough with priced-in, but yeah, the current price did in fact have priced in the COVID issue in their prices.

Just because a lot of unemployment and low revenue this year doesn't mean the value of the business will go down by as much as 50% or even lower. That's not how it works in regards to Value of a Business. 

Imagine if you have a good family business. This year will be rough, but you and your family have enough to keep everything a float. Some random investor comes in and said ""whew, bad times eh? Can i buy your business for 40% of its market price?""

If i were him, i will show them the exit door right away. Why would i sell it if i expect the business will recover in 2 years.

But actually there is a lot of stock right now facing this condition. Their stock are heavily penalized, and it is your job to find them and if you right, reaping the capital gain from them.

In regards to myself, two weeks ago I'm at 25% stock, 75% cash. But last weeks i decide to shift gear and move to 75% stock and 25% cash (I have to thanks [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos) for this). I left 25% just in case that I am wrong and market will drive even lower than this.","How to Value Stock in a Time of COVID-19 (ELI5 Edition)So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.

*Their most recent bid was accepted, thus beating out all the other competitors. As many of you may have heard, VISL was chosen as the company to provide live high definition &amp; uninterrupted video board systems for the Ferrari race series. This is a prestigious contract, this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this. This shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology, we should too. This contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts.

*Alongside their most recent contracts, if you look their recent history YTD, they are all over the world winning government contract bids &amp; making a name for themselves. With most companies reporting loss in profits, VISL is working hard &amp; continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology.

They will certainly delivery on their next stockholders meeting. This meeting will be on [May 8th](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-inc-to-hold-remote-annual-meeting-of-stockholders-on-new-date/)

*SEC filings: on 4/23/2020 VISL filed an 8K form, it only be bad if they were going bankrupt, but they are not. This form is directly correlated to DEFA14A they filed on 4/21/2020 which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next Friday, May 8th. This goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news, possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the Ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on. Either way, the 8K filing should be good news next Friday. [8K](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14090499&amp;RcvdDate=4/23/2020&amp;CoName=VISLINK%20TECHNOLOGIES,%20INC.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html)

*In the past two weeks on their company website, they share news of their current contract acquisitions &amp; each time they released something positive, their value flew up (albeit a small change) but still, it's a positive change. [Correlation](https://pasteboard.co/J6gfJAu5.png)

*They currently have a Target price set at $1 and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of $10. I don't believe it will reach $10 on the next 12months, but I strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year.

At the end of the day, it's a relatively cheap stock, it's trading at 34 cents. You can buy 100 shares right now for 34 dollars right now. I personally bought 200 shares. Because if I'm worng, this will drop back down give or take .25 cents which is where I bought my 200 shares. But if I'm right, then I'll make solid profit. Because it's cheap, I'm okay with purchasing 200 shares.

Anyy, that's my take on VISL. I personally think it's a strong buy &amp; if tomorrow there's a dip, I'll buy more. 

Take care &amp; as always, if you have doubts always do some DD on your own to make sure you're okay with purchasing whatever stock you decide to buy. Gg fellas :)","My personal DD on VISLVISL, they are a company known for their array of well produced products in the wireless Telecom industry. They have work with a vast majority of companies and the military as well. 

*One of their more recent &amp; great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of Jim McGowan as their Vice President &amp; Manager of VISL MiliGov division. This man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining VISL he was the vice president of FLIR systems, a company that has a $5 Billion dollar market cap. The recruitment of Jim McGowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to VISL.

Have you ever gotten blinded by bad advice and hollow rumors from r/pennystocks, r/wallstreetbets, Stocktwits or your uncle and threw away all your fundamental investing principles chasing the ultimately unfulfilled promise of quick, easy money only to find yourself in quicksand?

Where you mistook analyst reports and earnings targets for future guaranteed profits and found out they couldn't have been more incorrect?

Or maybe that time when you did literally did everything perfectly and bought what looked like a guaranteed sure thing based on every level of advanced analysis that could possibly be done  -- and due to somebody else's malfeasance or cooking the books you still lost it all?

t3_gb24yb,investing,LIQUIDITY TRAP!,"Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is ""priced in"".

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout

This is a **liquidity trap**. There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period. Or we'll try and print our way to inflation -- with consumer spending as the operative variable.

Welcome to the debt bubble! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...

* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance
* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt
* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE
* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand
* Wage increase (through Federal stimulus check or other) will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble.

Cash out high. Assets will be worth less than cash. Then pay down your debt or invest when we finally touch bottom. The environment looks exceptionally bearish for months and years to come. Everyone is scared to say liquidity trap because that will cause equities and lending to tank. But I encourage you to scream it.","LIQUIDITY TRAP!Banks are being conservative which might suggest that all of this is ""priced in"".

Good work on the CEO for cutting dividends and buybacks quickly (these should be treats when the shareholders don't get in the way of the long term prospects of the company).

t3_gaxocu,investing,CLO Engineering Is No Match for Covid-19 as Payments Get Cut Off,"By Sally Bakewell and Lisa Lee

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s engineering was supposed to
turn loans to junk-rated companies into relatively safe bonds
known as collateralized loan obligations. As the new coronavirus
slams the economy, some investors are finding that safety to be
fleeting.

Interest and principal payments are at risk of being cut
off for investment-grade CLOs in around a dozen different
transactions totaling a few billion dollars, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. The notes at risk have ratings as
high as the A tier, well within high-grade territory, and were
sold by name-brand money managers like Marathon Asset Management and Pretium Partners, the people said.

The securities are being battered as the Covid-19 pandemic
is bringing an economic downturn far worse than many CLOs were
designed to withstand, with some estimates for unemployment in
the second quarter reaching 30%. Loans are getting downgraded
and their value is dropping, which is triggering protections
designed to protect the safest securities issued by CLOs, those
rated AAA.

It’s the first time these safeguards, known as senior
overcollateralization tests, have been this widely triggered
since the 2008 financial crisis. Many more deals could meet the
same fate in the coming months. CLOs, a $700 billion market of
securities carrying ratings ranging from junk to AAA, were
largely left out of Federal Reserve stimulus programs.

“I don’t know anybody that modeled a CLO, or any other
structured product, around unemployment soaring from about 3% to the levels we could be facing in the next few weeks,” said Elen
Callahan, head of research at the Structured Finance
Association, a trade group. “If you told an analyst to model
that, they wouldn’t know what to do.”

The lowest-ranking securities sold by CLOs are most at
risk. Of the roughly 900 deals that have posted data over the
last month, around 21% have had cash payments cut down or cut
off from the riskiest portion of their deals, known as the
equity, according to Bank of America. In certain cases, junk-
rated notes, which are less risky than the equity, have been
affected as well. In mid-April, some analysts were expecting as
many as 1 in 3 CLOs to have to limit payouts to holders of their
riskiest securities.

Prices can end up dropping on securities in a deal where
payments have been cut off, because investors worry about the
quality of the loans backing the transaction, said Jason
Merrill, a CLO specialist at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
“It’s broadly considered a sign of deal distress,” Merrill
said.

While investors might expect high-yield securities to
suffer in a downturn, investment-grade instruments are supposed
to be less vulnerable. During the last financial crisis, CLO
bonds rated AA or AAA saw no defaults due to downgrades of the
underlying loans. The default rates for A and BBB rated notes
were infinitesimal, amounting to less than 0.01%, according to
the Structured Finance Association’s Callahan.

Bondholders could face curtailed payments as CLOs fail the
senior over-collateralization tests, which require the value of
the loans a CLO holds to exceed the value of the bonds it issued
by a sufficient amount. Failing that requirement results in
interest and principal payments getting deferred on the bonds
and cut off to equity. Those are instead diverted to pay down
the safest notes issued by the CLO.

CLOs issued by firms including Marathon, Pretium and
Jefferies Finance have failed these tests. If the portfolio
grows in value sufficiently over time relative to the
liabilities, the failure is “cured” and payments to investors
can resume. With the Jefferies transaction, it used cash built
up from loan repayments that couldn’t be used to buy new loans,
since the CLO’s reinvestment period had ended, to remedy the
deal’s breaches.

Representatives at Pretium, Marathon and Jefferies declined
to comment.

CLO portfolio managers can sometimes cure their shortfalls
through skillful trading, but loan downgrades have come so fast
that many managers were unable to shed poorly performing loans
quickly enough in recent weeks. Even more transactions are
failing less stringent tests of whether the deal has enough
collateral, known as interest-diversion tests.

“We are only at the beginning of the first inning of seeing
significant distress in the leveraged loan market,” said Michael
Barnes, executive chairman at Tiptree Inc., and founding partner
of Tricadia Holdings, an investment manager that also issued
CLOs. “It may severely impact equity, BBs and possibly BBBs with
capital losses in the coming years.”

The record surge in downgrades has pushed more CLOs to sell
loans they own: debt to companies rated CCC can usually only
account for about 7.5% of the holdings of a portfolio backing a
CLO under the terms of the securities.

With recent rating cuts, many portfolios saw these limits
exceeded. CLOs have to mark those excess loans at their market
trading price, which effectively lowers the value of the
collateral. That can spark more overcollateralization-test
breaches, potentially creating a downward spiral.

There will almost certainly be more CLOs selling loans,
depressing the value of their assets further. There’s little
sign that the businesses paralyzed by the pandemic can soon
return to normal levels of revenue generation that would improve
their financial standing. Moody’s Investors Service placed about
$22 billion of CLO securities -- which get rated separately from
their underlying loans -- on watch for a downgrade earlier this
month, citing the deterioration in corporate credit quality.
CLOs have these tests to protect the senior bondholders.

Market participants tout them as mechanisms that specifically
fortify CLOs against credit shocks, although whether they can
outlast a shock of this magnitude remains to be seen. Bank of
America said in a report earlier this month that failing
overcollateralization tests for investment-grade portions of
transactions likely hasn’t happened since the 2008 financial
crisis.

Here are some of the deals that have failed overcollateralization tests for investment-grade securities:

* The Pretium deal, called Crown Point CLO 6, was a reset of a
deal originally issued by NewMark Capital in 2014. Pretium
agreed to acquire two of NewMark Capital’s CLO assets in 2018.
The Marathon deal, CLO VI, was issued in 2014, and its re-
investment period, or the period during which the CLO manager
trades in an out of loans, ends next month meaning it had less
flexibility to remedy the breach.

* The Jefferies deal, Apex Credit CLO 2015-II, used loan
repayments that it hadn’t re-invested in new debt to effectively
“cure” the breach and ultimately then passed the tests, one of
the people familiar with the matter said.

* A middle-market CLO managed by ArrowMark Partners, Peaks
2014-1A, breached its senior OC test. The deal has more exposure
to larger loans than typical middle-market deals. It’s the only
deal of ArrowMark’s CLOs to have breached an OC provision. A
representative for the Denver-based firm declined to comment.","CLO Engineering Is No Match for Covid-19 as Payments Get Cut OffBy Sally Bakewell and Lisa Lee

t3_garh7b,investing,FAANG stocks are holding up the market and they all missed on EPS so far,"The Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings. EDIT: NEVERMIND, AMAZON MISSED ON EPS TOO. Surprisingly Apple was the only beat but that's because their estimates were low.

Here's the thing... According to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter.

If we look at tech across the board, we have some winners like Microsoft and Zoom, but chip makers like AMD (which met EPS estimates but didn't beat) and Qualcom both delivered poor guidance for coming quarters. AMD has been rallying back to all time highs. Nvidia is also near all time highs. Yet, despite the relative strength in the tech sector, the current trend of earnings, economic forecasts and guidance (or lack thereof) strongly suggests that tech will take a huge hit in coming quarters.

Let's look at how concentrated the S&amp;P is in the very top stocks, all of which are tech... [https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg) This blows the dot com boom out of the water. Now consider how much of the S&amp;P the rest of the tech stocks account for.

All of this is to say, watch these tech stocks closely.  If they fall, the indexes will go with them. There is a high probability they will lead the next leg of the drop.

Also, here's my take on the long term value of these stocks. The US is moving closer and closer towards adopting basic income. Nothing is guaranteed, but if anything has made the case for increased automation and basic income, it's the current circumstance. Such a policy would likely necessitate a rise in corporate taxes or a VAT. That's a direct hit to  the earnings of notorious tax evaders like Amazon. In addition, basic income would give working class people more leverage in holding out for higher pay because they wouldn't be weighing job offers against total destitution. This too would detract heavily from future earnings.

After the 2000 crash, the Nasdaq didn't recover to the highs for 15 years. If you look at the S&amp;P chart I posted, two of the top five stocks in 2000 were Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft took 16 years to recover to its highs and Intel never fully recovered.

Therefor, I advise extreme caution in this environment. Do not be shamed out of taking profits near all time highs if that's what you personally feel comfortable with. I won't say it's wrong to hold if you're ready to accept the risk, however, just because these companies are good ""blue chips stocks"" that doesn't mean that they're low risk or no risk, regardless of your time horizon. That's just my two cents.

EDIT: It's funny that the tech stocks started to crash the day after I posted this. That was quick.","FAANG stocks are holding up the market and they all missed on EPS so farThe Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings. EDIT: NEVERMIND, AMAZON MISSED ON EPS TOO. Surprisingly Apple was the only beat but that's because their estimates were low.

Here's the thing... According to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter.

t3_gaqofj,investing,Equity raise arbitrage,"With businesses raising equity to sure up balance sheets, substitute revenue loss and take advantage over distressed/under priced asset valuations - as an individual investor i am always trying to adapt and discover new ways to generate further returns. 

On a couple of occasions i have seen equity being raised at a predetermined 'placement price', with this being said if i were to take up this offering and the market price had increased, is the spread between market and placement all profit?

ie. placement price = $1.0, market price at settlement = $1.50, therefore profit = $0.5 per share.

Am i missing something? is there a dilution aspect that needs to be incorporated. 

This also got me thinking, if this is possible is there a potential play in holding 1 share in each company in hopes of this scenario occurring repeatedly? I understand that current market situations are extraordinary and are key determinate of majority of these equity raises, however even in a 'normal' market i could see this as a play. I am also aware there is usually a price/volume ceiling associated with the number of shares available to purchase in the raise.

However, user base growth has been partially offset by decreased ad revenue.

Enter MTCH, 98% of revenue is attributable to direct sources, such as subscription fees, while ad revenue falls under indirect sources and comprises some portion of the remaining 2% (2019 AR). Current EPS estimates are around 9% lower than actual EPS Q4 '19 and have been downgraded multiple times in the last 90 days. Meanwhile short interest is extremely high (ranked #[2](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)) with a short float near [70%](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MTCH) and a time to cover of [18](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mtch/short-interest) days. 

The elephant in the room for this stock is the pending IAC separation and I do not pretend to understand how this event will impact the long-term outlook for MTCH. However, investors do not appear to have been spooked by a recently announced amendment to the IAC separation deal and it is hard to believe that this will weigh heavily on the interpretation of Q1 results. 

Despite dropping estimates I see no reason for an ad driven Q1 drop in MTCH revenue or EPS given the data now available from FB and SNAP; in fact declining competition for advertising may benefit the company as this is one of their larger expenses. If true this puts MTCH in position for a significant earnings beat. Short sellers are vulnerable to this EPS suprise and may find themselves in a squeeze; this may also be triggered if the stock continues to climb on positive market sentiment from other large corps' (AMZN) reports this week.","MTCH set up for a short squeeze?With the advent of social distancing social media/web based services (food delivery, teleconferencing, exercise, education etc) engagement is surging (see recent FB, SNAP earnings reports).

t3_gamjhv,investing,Stocks go up and stocks go down.,"TLDR: Tick tock, we’re living in a simulation that will come to an end sooner or later.

Opinion: **We should all come to the conclusion that Trump sees the stock market’s success as the true picture of our economy.** 

That being said, as far as I know the election isn’t until November (7 months from now). 

If the market tanked in a matter of weeks, why wouldn’t the FED be able to again just pick up all the pieces once more should it happen all over again. You can’t all be seriously thinking we’ll hit ATH in the next week or two and sustain that till November and beyond. 

Let’s be real, Trumps buddies got smacked, he gave them a helping hand and now they’re in a prime position to short the market and make their money all over again. Trump can be the hero once more. 

Yes the recovery won’t be V shaped, so it’ll be booming after a “healthy drop.” Every figure, every analyst, every projection is looking for some kind of pullback. 

Even bullish investors I follow are starting to get confused. Yes this isn’t 2008, but even back in January everyone and their mother was screaming that stocks were overvalued. 

Now with a global pandemic, unemployment at record highs, stimulus for everyone, GDP contraction at great depression levels, and we’re all of a sudden back?? It’s just not healthy, PERIOD. It’s not sustainable. Q2 numbers are expected to be shit. Everyone’s guidance is basically pulled. And look at the markets reaction last week when news broke out that Gileads drug could be a flop.. it spooked! 

Things are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That’s not to say we won’t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we’re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it’ll likely fall hard.. maybe it’ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash. Who knows. 

In the end, bulls will have their days, and so will the bears. You can all throw insults at each other when the tables turn towards you then.

Things are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That’s not to say we won’t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we’re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it’ll likely fall hard.. maybe it’ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash. Who knows. 

In the end, bulls will have their days, and so will the bears. You can all throw insults at each other when the tables turn towards you then.

t3_galww3,investing,Shorting the market at anypoint in the last month on any negative data has not worked - how are you coping with this?,"Chipotle, Tesla near all time highs. SPY and DIA 12% off all time highs. I used to think when this first started there would be a V shaped recovery and that the virus's impact on business will not be so bad, but I changed positions in early April when oil crashed and we saw that massive unemployment was coming as well as worsening data from the virus showing the worst case outcome. The unemployment figures will change consumer spending, many people are surviving on debt right now and that debt has to get payed off -  instead of buying new cars and going on vacation spending will be much more modest.

Yet the market shrugs it off. If everything is going up because of where earnings will be 2-3 years from now my questions are:

1. If there is this much confidecne in the future why not value companies at what they will earn 10-20-50 years from now? Why do stocks go down at all if ""future earnings will always be better""? Thats been the market behavior for the last decade.
2. Its hard enough to predict where earnings will be next quarter, why are we seeing trading based on where things are expected to be 2 years from now? How can anyone make any investment decisions with any accuracy, seems like there are a lot of assumptions taking place that are not following the fundamanetal data, or I am missing something.
3. Things are NOT CHEAP anymore, they were the last 2 weeks of March relative to the last few years. If people shrug off the bad news now, why didn't they back then when nothing is really different and we already saw that what happened in China has spread globally. Why are people buying Tesla now at 900 when it was 350 a month ago?
4. I thought at around SPY 250 we would turn around to test the lows again but its been straight up at a 45 degree angle. There is an arguement saying that the crash already happened and thats why everything is rebounding. Okay great, the bottom is in but the economy is different and worse than a lot of people expected. With oil remaining this low the shale economic boom we've enjoyed for the last 10 years is over and all of those companies can't turn a profit and will lay off a couple hundred thousand people at least. ""So what, stocks only go up"" doesn't seem like the responsible behavior.
5. Earnings right now are NOT GOOD, most have had a full Q1 and have barely had any time for the economic shutdown to affect them. Most are also giving no guidance saying they don't know how things will be. Stocks go up.
6. A headline declaring ""the economy is reopoening"" doesn't mean everyone will suddenly fill up movie theatres like before and start going on vacation. Many people living with elderly family will still be cautious through  the rest of the year if not indefinately until there is a vaccine  and hanging out at a bar while maintaining 6 feet of social distancing isn't going to be the same as before.

Do you think the market is overly optimistic on returning back to normal? If not, what are we missing and failing to understand? Why are we so close to all time highs? US markets exchange $168 billion a day. The fed adding $5 billion to that per day, mostly in treasuries, is a drop in the bucket no?

t3_gal8gs,investing,Elon Musk says orders to stay home are ‘fascist’ in expletive-laced rant during Tesla earnings call,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lashed out at government stay at home orders as “fascist” in an expletive-laced rant on Tesla’s Q1 2020 earnings call.

While answering analysts’ questions about liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic, Musk called shelter-in-place orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.”


Musk said he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at the company’s factory in Fremont, California, saying that possibility should be considered “a serious risk” given Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its Shanghai-based plant. Tesla had initially said the factory it would remain open despite shelter-in -lace orders until the county where it’s located said it could not be considered an essential business. Six counties, including Alameda, where Tesla’s factory is located, recently extended their shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. 

Musk had spoken out about government restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Twitter, but further expressed his opinion on Wednesday’s call while encouraging government officials to invest in infrastructure. He praised China for having “much better” infrastructure than the U.S.

“This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said.

“I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

At another point on the call, he said, “So the expansion of the shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country, excuse me. It’s outrage, it’s an outrage. It will cause loss, great, great harm, but not just to Tesla, but any company. And while people will weather the storm there are many small companies that will not,” he said.

He continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f--k?”

The Bay Area’s orders do not say that people cannot leave their house, but do restrict non-essential businesses from staying open and ban many other activities, such as large public gatherings.

Some states, including Michigan and Texas, have seen protests of stay at home orders as fears about economic deterioration grow. But public health officials have cautioned that reopening too quickly could result in cases of Covid-19 re-accelerating and developing new hot spots that could overwhelm health systems.

t3_gaixa0,investing,Not a bear rally but the continuation of a bubble?,"There's been a lot of chatter on here about the rally and whether or not it will remain robust but I'm going to pitch something more radical.

This isn't a market that's correcting for being oversold and it isn't just a run of the mill bear rally.

This is a full on bubble.

For your consideration here are Hyman P. Minsky's five stages of a bubble. I believe we are firmly in the beginning to mid phase of stage 3.


**1.Displacement**

Fed is willing to pump infinite amounts of liquidity into the banking sector

Interest rates likely to stay at 0% for months or even years

Feds buying junk bonds therefore few if any blue chip corporations will need to worry about liquidity


**2.Boom**

t3_gai39k,investing,The road to recovery for heavily indebted EU countries?,"What I rarely see discussed is the implications of very indebted EU countries like Italy and Spain on the rest of the EU, and what implications it could have for businesses in Europe. And I think it's a discussion worth having, since I can't seem to paint a picture that isn't horrific for the EU (and especially Southern Europe). As I have at most marginal knowledge in this field, please read the bullet points as my train of thought.

**Pre COVID-19 situation:**

* ECB interest rate at 0.0% interest since 2016
* ECB buying up debt ever since the Eurocrisis
* Debt to GDP ratio: France, Spain, Belgium nearing 100%; Italy 130%
* In the best of times, aforementioned countries could barely make a dent in paying back their debt
* Saving grace is that the yield is very low and even negative on short term bonds.
* Ageing population and high youth unemployment

**COVID-19 situation:**

* Spain, Italy, France most hit areas. As a result, they had to implement the most restrictive lockdowns seen in the West. Industry at standstill. GDP likely contracting \~8-10% or more on average for these countries.
* ECB buying up debt, securities and everything in between.
* Northern European countries very reluctant to implement low yield eurobonds, as this would increase interest on their respective outstanding debts and would be electoral suicide. Meanwhile southern European countries see anti EU sentiments lighting up again due to receiving a cold shower from their Northern counterparts.

**The future**

* Countries like Spain, Italy (and to a lesser extent), France would need to keep existing social safety nets buoyant while seeing massive increases in unemployment and business foreclosures.
* Stimulus money is needed to jumpstart the economy
* These countries will bury themselves into deeper debt levels.
* ECB has less room to manoeuvre than FED, and even less after QEing and keeping interest rates low for years.

I can only see 2 outcomes in this: 1) Some kind of EU reconciliation. Northern European countries will be forced to service South European debts for decades to come (Eurobonds or some other mechanism) at knifepoint (i.e. otherwise face imminent depression or EU collapse). This will increase the role of the EU and diminishing the power and role of individual member states for good. This will leave the Northern European countries weaker and more indebted 2) Spain and Italy will truly be stagnant for decades to come, making the future of the EU uncertain due to anti EU sentiment.

What am I missing? Am I too bearish on this? Would it be advisable to stay clear of most European stocks for now?","The road to recovery for heavily indebted EU countries?What I rarely see discussed is the implications of very indebted EU countries like Italy and Spain on the rest of the EU, and what implications it could have for businesses in Europe.

(Bloomberg) -- Hudson’s Bay Co. missed April payments on
two commercial mortgage-backed securities that were part of $696 million in financing for Saks Fifth Avenue and other stores.
The securities, originated in 2015, were current until this
month when the company missed interest-only debt payments
totaling $3.2 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
and a person familiar with the matter.

HBC spokeswoman Nicole Schoenberg declined to comment.
The missed payments in the HBC debt portfolio were on
securities that financed 34 properties - 10 Saks and 24 Lord &amp;
Taylor stores. The Saks locations include Beverly Hills,
California, Atlanta, Chicago and Miami.

HBC operates retail stores, which have been hit hard by
social-distancing guidelines that have frozen much the economies
in the U.S. and Canada. Department stores were facing financial
challenges even before being forced to close, as shoppers
increasingly embraced the convenience of e-commerce. Now, those problems are getting worse.

Macy’s Inc., which has furloughed workers and shuttered
stores, is exploring a rescue financing deal to shore up its
liquidity. Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. missed payments on some
bonds this month, according to a letter from an investor. J.C.
Penney Co. also skipped an interest payment and huddled with
advisers, with bankruptcy among the options under discussion.
Almost 11% of retail CMBS loans were as much as 30 days
delinquent this month, up from 1.7% in March, according to an
April 23 report by the CRE Finance Council, a commercial real

t3_gads6p,investing,How many months would it take to massively scale up production of Gilead's Remdesivir?,"\[EDIT: ADDED HOSPITAL DISTRIBUTION NUMBERS &amp; CONCERN ABOUT PRODUCTION CHALLENGES\]

Because markets are getting enthusiastic with the recent news of the Covid-treatment trials of Remdesivir, it would be worthwhile to get some numbers of the time and investment it would take Gilead to scale up production of the drug. The conclusions could be also interesting to anticipate how markets will react to further Remdesivir news. I tried to find some reliable numbers in respect to the dosage of Remdesivir and put these into context of a full-fledged drug production.

In one source i've found the following about the dosage of Remdesivir, but i'm not sure if this applies in absolute terms for Covid-19 treatments.

**Dosage**

The dosing [regimen](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5278) under study in the U.S. for RDV is as follows:

* An initial one-time dose of 200mg
* Followed by 100mg per day for 10 days

Remdesivir is administered intravenously by injection.

The drug is stored in small vials (a 20ml), which contain 100mg Remdesivir as lyophilized powder. Each vial with 100mg Remdesivir powder is reconstituted with 19 mL of sterile water for injection and diluted into intravenous infusion fluids prior to intravenous administration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calculating production volume and demand**

I recall reading that Remdesivir is more effective in early treatment, hence on a sidenote a widely spread testing regime seems to be crucial here.

Assuming Remdesivir would be administered to 80% of infected patients at least for 5 days (recent study indirectly suggested 5 day treatment may be sufficient) and 20% of patients for at least 10 days (due to age, complications, etc.), and assuming (for the sake of having a starting point) there is a million patients every 3 months... the following calculations would apply

800000 patients x (200mg + (5days x 100mg)) = 560.000.000mg

200000 patients x (200mg + (10days x 100mg) = 240.000.000mg

800.000.000mg / 100mg (one vial) = 8.000.000 vials

Considering shipment to 4000 hospitals worldwide (the US has about 6000 hospitals) for one month and equally distributed volumes of Remdesivir, about 650 vials would be available to each hospital for a month, which is sufficient to treat between 54 to 92 patients monthly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns on production**

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/03/26/problem-remdesivir-making-it-14665](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/03/26/problem-remdesivir-making-it-14665)

It appears that Remdesivir is quite difficult to produce, hence its high cost. More info in above article. The remdesivir sequence consists of five reactions, and the difficult part is to ensure a high enough yield in each of these reactions. The process seems to be labour and time intensive.

**questions**

How much time would it take to build up one or several lab production line(s) able to make 8million Remdesivir vials every quarter?

How many patients each quarter would one need to anticipate globally, when lockdowns are lifted?

Regardless of the details considering various models it appears to be a huge undertaking.","How many months would it take to massively scale up production of Gilead's Remdesivir?\[EDIT: ADDED HOSPITAL DISTRIBUTION NUMBERS &amp; CONCERN ABOUT PRODUCTION CHALLENGES\]

t3_gadhod,investing,$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19,"Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1. In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February.
2. On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.
3. Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).
4. $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.
5. Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US. EU is past the 6-8 week mark and there's yet to be a recovery.
6. According to OICA, plant closures could cost US auto makers at least 900k auto sales in 2020, and global light vehicle production may be down as much as 20%.","$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

With many of the world's cars sitting idle right now, and with most driving limited to nearby locations like a grocery store, I expect we are going to see many millions of dead car batteries. Once a car battery has been dead for a day or two, it is actually permanently damaged - crystals form on the lead plates inside the battery, often reducing it to 50% or less of its capacity.

Johnson Controls, the world's largest car battery maker, (disclaimer, I bought some of their stock this morning) is down perhaps 30% from January, but they could see increased sales as a result of the lockdowns and damage.

Gilead Announces Results From Phase 3 Trial of Investigational Antiviral Remdesivir in Patients With Severe COVID-19

April 29, 2020 at 8:35 AM EDT [**PDF Version**](http://investors.gilead.com/node/36871/pdf)

***-- Study Demonstrates Similar Efficacy with 5- and 10-Day Dosing Durations of Remdesivir --***

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 29, 2020-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 \[95% CI 0.51 – 1.12\] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “These study results complement data from the placebo-controlled study of remdesivir conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and help to determine the optimal duration of treatment with remdesivir. The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of a pandemic, to help hospitals and healthcare workers treat more patients in urgent need of care.”

Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.

In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.

Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7 percent (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64 percent (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61 percent (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.

**Impact of Earlier Treatment**

In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62 percent of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49 percent of patients who were treated late.

“These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective.”

Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3 percent (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0 percent (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.

Key efficacy and safety results from the study are included in the table below.

**About the SIMPLE Trials**

Gilead initiated two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir, the SIMPLE studies, in countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The first SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. The initial phase of the study randomized 397 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on the first day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, administered intravenously, in addition to standard of care. An expansion phase of the study was recently added and will enroll an additional 5,600 patients, including patients on mechanical ventilation. The study is being conducted at 180 trial sites around the world, including sites in the United States, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.

The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3 percent (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0 percent (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.

Key efficacy and safety results from the study are included in the table below.

**About the SIMPLE Trials**

Gilead initiated two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir, the SIMPLE studies, in countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The first SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. The initial phase of the study randomized 397 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on the first day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, administered intravenously, in addition to standard of care. An expansion phase of the study was recently added and will enroll an additional 5,600 patients, including patients on mechanical ventilation. The study is being conducted at 180 trial sites around the world, including sites in the United States, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.

t3_ga9f77,investing,What Is The Outlook For Crypto Currencies?,"We saw a huge boom in crypto currencies back in 2017. I missed out on this and the growth seemed almost entirely speculative in nature. I avoided any investment and missed out on a lot of gains (and losses).

I'm now in a position where I'm generating a lot more income and looking to diversify outside of stocks. I've now set up small recurring deposits for Bitcoin and Etherum. I'm somewhat treating this like an investment in gold with a lot more speculation that it might increase and the deposits are small enough that it won't hurt if these go to zero.

My question is what is the outlook around crypto currencies. They still seem entirely speculative and hold no inherent value. However, with the current state of the world economy and all these banks printing money, you have to think we might be in for a drastic change in how we think about currency. Also... That money has to go somewhere. We're seeing stocks return back to normal even when no one is working. How long until the population starts parking that money in other assets like crypto? We're already seeing a rise.","What Is The Outlook For Crypto Currencies?We saw a huge boom in crypto currencies back in 2017.

t3_ga88k1,investing,Gold Mining companies vs. gold commodity pricing,"I've recently purchased shares in a gold mining company in order to get exposure to gold price increases. However, a friend informed me that investing in a mining company doesn't expose you to positive gold price changes more than simply investing in the commodity itself due to the fact that gold mines deal in future contracts, therefore his thinking is that today's price swings don't help the mines value because they are already locked in to sell their gold at a previous lower price. This sounds right, but also seems weird as I have personally witness gold mine stocks fluctuate along with gold price changes. In addition while reviewing a gold mine's financial statement it said outright that their revenue was effected by commodity prices.  Is this due to a misinformed public on how gold mines generate their revenue? or does my friend not have the full picture?

t3_ga85gd,investing,Discussion: Near Term Inflationary Pressures,"Last night I was thinking about how the world economy is re-opening, and that pretty much across the world, the economies will be re-opening in stages. It seems that everywhere the first stage will be to open at a limited capacity. Speaking with a few restaurateurs in the last few days, They are concerned that opening at 25%/50%/75% capacity will allow them to cover their fixed costs until we go back to normal. 

So that got me thinking, how can these folks stay over water over the next few months? Then it dawned on me: Raising prices of their products wouldn't seem that far fetched. Despite demand dropping considerably over the next few months, supply would also be low (There will be establishments never re-opening + limited capacity rules = low supply). 

I continued down this rabbit hole of thought, and realized that maybe, there are some inflationary pressures lingering, but I haven't seen much talk of them. Here's some inflationary actions that I identified:

1. The one above. Establishments raising prices to stay afloat. 

2. Direct stimulus from all governments, both in forms of free money (Expanded EI) and cheap lending. 

3. Gas being at a near all time low. 

4. [This one is more meta] - The enormous amounts of marketing both from governments and corporations towards the consumer. I have a feeling that there will be a never-before-seen push to spend once things are more clear. 

I am not particularly sold on the thesis above, but I am hoping it triggers discussion here. Is there an argument for higher than expected inflation in the short to mid term?","Discussion: Near Term Inflationary PressuresLast night I was thinking about how the world economy is re-opening, and that pretty much across the world, the economies will be re-opening in stages.

t3_ga3dz2,investing,Selling for what you put in.,"MRNA bought 20 shares @ $24.73, currently @ $47.81. So if I sell 10 shares, I get what I paid, with 10 shares essentially free. So if the vaccine tanks, I'm not out anything that I put in, but I wouldn't make anything. If I sell all, I'll profit the same amount I put in (depending on the time I sell). Or leave it all in and see where it goes. 

I'm wanting to see how far this climbs. But my current job is 3 long hour shifts over nights every week. So for three days every week I miss a lot. I don't want to check one day and see where they doubled while I slept and when I'm off of work they tank 50% lol. But I also can't keep up on news and everything either so I can't really watch it much for what might be coming. 

Also, if I sell for just what I put in, essentially not making any money do I still have to claim that on taxes? 

Any advice?","Selling for what you put in.MRNA bought 20 shares @ $24.73, currently @ $47.81. So if I sell 10 shares, I get what I paid, with 10 shares essentially free.

t3_ga29zs,investing,ETF portfolio for stable growth?,"First off let me say thank you for everyone in this sub(s), I’ve learned so much from it.

I'm planning on making a shift from purely stocks/options portfolio to 80/20 mix of ETFs and growth stocks.  Maybe like a second account altogether. I’m 31 so my thinking is mostly to buy/hold, not to actively trade. Here are my possible ETF selections.

1. VOO (instead of SPY because of expense ratio [https://stockanalysis.com/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/](https://stockanalysis.com/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/)). Or Just go in different direction with VUG ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/VUG-vs-VOO](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/VUG-vs-VOO))
2. VTI (Total market exposure comparison with VOO [https://stockanalysis.com/voo-vs-vti/](https://stockanalysis.com/voo-vs-vti/)). I’m in between VTI or just go in a different direction with Small cap like VB/VBK or SLYV
3. QQQ (Because of non tech companies, NASDAQ 100 and also its popularity)
4. VXUS (International market exposure). I also found VIGI I have to do some research which one's better
5. FTEC (Technology sector)-I thought this is better compared to XLK ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/XLK-vs-FTEC](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/XLK-vs-FTEC)). But I’m not sure if VGT is better ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/FTEC-vs-VGT](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/FTEC-vs-VGT))
6. ICLN (Clean energy). TAN is another option but its focus is on Solar ([https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34976n/buying\_tan\_and\_icln/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34976n/buying_tan_and_icln/))
7. XLE (Energy sector). I know this is in downtrend so this won’t be a long term hold like the others.
8. JETS (Airlines)
9. VNQ (REITs) I haven't done any research on this one though ([https://www.thebalance.com/best-reit-etfs-4174043](https://www.thebalance.com/best-reit-etfs-4174043))

There are so many other categories like emerging markets(VWO,EEM etc., developed markets(EFA,VEA etc.), sector wise like XLF(finance) and specialized ones like GLD (Gold),BND (Bond market) and so many categories ( and sub categories through a bunch of providers. What I haven't nailed down is what percentages is like a safe bet and of course for DCA'ing going forward.

There are couple sectors I think are good but not sure if I'd want them on my long term portfolio: Defense (ITA), manufacturing (FIDU for example). Want to hear your opinions on these. I guess we can replace REITs with either one of these if the returns/growth is good.

I have no idea how 3X leveraged ETFs/indexes like SOXL, SQQQ etc. work. But I want to see what do you think of having a balance ETF to these (like VIIX for example) in case of market downs. Is SQQQ a good one to hang on to or no?

What I'm planning to do is to have about 6-8 of these ETFs and maybe 3-4 blue-chip stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN etc. What I'm conflicted is this seems redundant as these 4 stocks usually makeup couple (or more) of the above mentioned ETFs. I'm hoping for some suggestions here.

I think it's hard to keep track of stocks if you own too many. I mean there's so many debates on how many is too many. I want to see what you guys think.

Thanks in advance for reading and for any responses.

I've mostly been investing in ETFs and some stocks to play around, but over the years have gotten more interested in building a long-term buy &amp; hold stock portfolio myself. I currently have some time to spare and interest in analyzing companies and doing some legwork. 

There are plenty of posts here that discuss whether individual stock picking can beat the market or not  - this is not one of them.

I'm mainly looking for legit services that don't spam you with upselling their services (think MF) that could help along the way in screening and researching stocks. Resources I'm currently using are FT, WSJ, and Handelsblatt (suscription); and barrons, yahoo finance, Morningstar, google finance and vhinny (free).

One that I'd be particularly interested in is '**New Constructs**', which is a mix of human and AI robo advisor service created by MIT and HBS professors and researchers. Their proposition is to be ""the only Investment Research provider with a U.S. Patent for a system and method to reverse accounting distortion and analyze financial information to automatically determine the true profitability of a company, making us one of the top investment research firms in the nation."" Their research gets featured regularly in finance news across the board including Barrons, Reuters, Forbes, NYT, cnbc, etc. Their two premium services are priced at $50 and $100 per month.

Has anyone heard of them and have any experience? Open to other recommendations, too.

t3_g9z1jr,investing,Portfolio Allocation Strategy at Berkshire Hathaway,"How does Warren Buffet &amp; team approach portfolio allocation at Berkshire Hathaway?

Is there a particular allocation model that Berkshire uses? How do they decide how much to put in one sector/position vs. another? This doesn't seem to be widely discussed as I couldn't find anything about this on the internet or in Buffet's annual letters. There clearly is some kind of portfolio allocation rule that they follow as there are often marginal adjustments to their various positions every quarter, as reported in their 13Fs. Well, I'm very curious to know what that is.

so as the title says i'm very new to investing and the only reason i have done is that a few of my friends have said that its a pretty good time to invest in oil in the long run so me not knowing much at all invested some money (not much at all like £100) into Oil-19May20 now i have made some money as i bought mine when the price was at $10.5 and its not back up to $12.8 (currently).

So i came to here to see if i'm doing this right and had a few questions

1. Will i need to sell my stock when it comes to the 19th of may which is when Oil-19May20 runs out?
2. is it worth just selling now and investing into oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron or go to something like the United States oil fund

t3_g9qibl,investing,PE investor perch: Help me make sense of the s-storm we're seeing in real-time,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

Here are my two-cents as a middle-market private equity investor; it's an interesting perch to watch things unfolding real-time... and which frankly makes me wonder WTH is going on in the public markets. I'm not going to edit this for typos.

**Earnings:** Our investments are relatively resilient (think trains, pharmacies, food supply chain stuff). But our earnings are getting absolutely smoked; I'm talking (20%) to (30%) territory. Our Q1 valuations won't really reflect this as March will have some China noise and 2 weeks of lockdown (the majority of American businesses will feel this on the margin), but Q2 and Q3 will be a mess... for us, we mark-to-market and carry on; but the hit on earnings poses a big covenant and liquidity issue.

In the public sphere, mark-to-market *is* the market. I can only interpret the market as saying your NTM earnings, however risky and unknown (this is without precedent, after all), are irrelevant because the long-term story holds water. Since when did the public markets move from being so short-term and hung up on quarterly earnings to so long-term? I'm lost.

**Refi wall**: Private companies went into Covid-19 with historically levered balance sheets. Granted, a lot of issuances were cov light at higher leverage levels, some are HY and are trading like shit, but even the best private loan terms have fixed charge covenants which will bite borrowers in the ass. There's about $1.5tn of corporate loans maturing over the next 12 months (what we call a refi wall). When that wall hits, companies will be refinancing off of significantly lower earnings (best case) or will be trying to find debt in a market that's seized (which is what we saw in 2009).

Imagine you earned $100mm of EBITDA and you were 4x levered heading into Covid. Now it's time to refinance, and your EBITDA is $75mm; you'd be looking to fill a 5x of hole on your balance sheet, and no one is lending at those levels any time soon. Sure, some businesses won't be down (25%), but a lot of industrial, old-world, cyclical businesses will be - and then some.

If you're a PE-backed company, you call in your best lending relationships and add some equity to fill the hole (or you say F it). If you're a SMB, I have to imagine you just throw in the towel. What other option do you have?

Government stimulus has been a huge boost on this front, but marginal credit heading into Covid-19 will be unfinanceable and businesses will go under en masse, whether it's a liquidity crunch today or an inability to refi tomorrow.

**Farm crisis**: I don't know why it doesn't get more media attention, but there's a storm brewing in the food supply chain. Granted, these points are hearsay, but we have it on pretty good authority that commercial farms will soon be forced to euthanize entire herds of livestock and poultry. The reality is that cows, chickens, and pigs get too old and too fat quickly, and when processors are shut down, there isn't a lot of time to spare. That's the protein story.

Produce could also face issues. Again, hearsay, but we've heard that some crops aren't going in during prime planting season. You might already be seeing the food supply chain - particularly truck - screwing things up (noticed any fresh produce missing from the menu of your grocery store or current take-out spot?), but if there's a fundamental supply issue it would spell serious trouble. You thought fighting over the last roll of toilet paper was bad?

I would love to be fact-checked on this front. Again, it's coming from sources in the thick of things, but it's quite ominous when food security in North America is a topic of discussion.

**O&amp;G**: The fracking boom has been a massive driver of employment over the last decade or so. As wells shut off, people will be sent home. I don't think I need to go into this more, but too much or too little oil are both huge issues for America.

**Credit cards &amp; other consumer debt**: This one has been getting a bit more traction as the value investor blogs have been all over it. Let's say we are back to normal in a few weeks or months time. And people are now able to go out and start spending again. Notwithstanding the fact that unemployment is insane (26mm?!) and it will take time for those people to re-enter the workforce, there will be a mountain of backdated credit card, mortgage, car, rent, and other loan payments they'll need to service before they buy that BBQ, renovate their house, or take a trip.

What card do you guys think the government has up its sleeve to gloss over that? I'm a family of four and I don't want the banks to foreclose on my house (obviously) or my car (to get to work); do we honestly think there's much left over after all that debt service? Maybe mass consumer loan forgiveness or refinancing (i.e., tack missed payments onto the end of the loan). I just haven't seen it.

Someone tell me everything above is wrong and I'm just seeing problems where solutions are in the works. I just can't make sense of everything I'm seeing - earnings getting smashed, lenders getting picky, fundamental supply and demand issues - next to a market that's modestly down (relatively) from record-highs. Am I missing something?","PE investor perch: Help me make sense of the s-storm we're seeing in real-timeLong-time lurker, first-time poster.

Here are my two-cents as a middle-market private equity investor; it's an interesting perch to watch things unfolding real-time... and which frankly makes me wonder WTH is going on in the public markets. I'm not going to edit this for typos.

**Earnings:** Our investments are relatively resilient (think trains, pharmacies, food supply chain stuff). But our earnings are getting absolutely smoked; I'm talking (20%) to (30%) territory. Our Q1 valuations won't really reflect this as March will have some China noise and 2 weeks of lockdown (the majority of American businesses will feel this on the margin), but Q2 and Q3 will be a mess... for us, we mark-to-market and carry on; but the hit on earnings poses a big covenant and liquidity issue.

In the public sphere, mark-to-market *is* the market. I can only interpret the market as saying your NTM earnings, however risky and unknown (this is without precedent, after all), are irrelevant because the long-term story holds water. Since when did the public markets move from being so short-term and hung up on quarterly earnings to so long-term? I'm lost.

**Refi wall**: Private companies went into Covid-19 with historically levered balance sheets. Granted, a lot of issuances were cov light at higher leverage levels, some are HY and are trading like shit, but even the best private loan terms have fixed charge covenants which will bite borrowers in the ass. There's about $1.5tn of corporate loans maturing over the next 12 months (what we call a refi wall). When that wall hits, companies will be refinancing off of significantly lower earnings (best case) or will be trying to find debt in a market that's seized (which is what we saw in 2009).

Imagine you earned $100mm of EBITDA and you were 4x levered heading into Covid. Now it's time to refinance, and your EBITDA is $75mm; you'd be looking to fill a 5x of hole on your balance sheet, and no one is lending at those levels any time soon. Sure, some businesses won't be down (25%), but a lot of industrial, old-world, cyclical businesses will be - and then some.

They take they comapre younger working adults to middle age (age 40-65) working adults to try to predict the stock market. The basic theory is that younger adults(age 20-39) are likely to take out debt and be broke from having kids vs middle age whom would be investing and building their retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i was interested in a different ratio: the **retired population vs the working population**, defined as:

\-working population age 19-64

\-retired popuation 65+

My general thesis is that the working population serves as buyers into the stock market and the retired population serves as eventually sellers in the stock market. And yes, im aware many retiress stay invested, but they stop adding to their accounts and begin to make withdrawals overall. **I'll post the data in the comment section** to make this post easier to read.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1950 the ratio is about 10x, meaning there are 10 working class buying stocks for every 1 retiree withdrawaling from stocks. Today that ratio has steadily decreased and to about  6x and will be  3.5x by the time many of you retire.

Food for thought: how many new buyers does it take to replace one seller? Adjusted for inflation, the dow jones has made 1,000% gains since the 1950s, so does it take 10x new buyers to displace a seller with 1,000% return? luckily they are not cashing out 100% and only take out what they need to spend each month. So we stay afloat with only 6x new buyers for every 1 retired seller.","Population ratios effects on the stock marketSo i was [reading this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2004/01/2004a_bpea_geanakoplos.pdf) thought it was interesting.

The Dallas-based air carrier lost $94 million after a tax benefit, or 18 cents per diluted share, as revenue slid 18 percent to $4.2 billion. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting a loss of 41 cents a share on revenue of $4.42 billion.

t3_g9k5mr,investing,Q2 Tanker earnings estimates.,"I posted in WSB, but the DD is more in the style of r/investing. Estimates used actual fleet composition of each company, using spot rates of each vessel class starting from beginning of Q2. 


For you all that think it’s too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.

EURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20

TNK 7.50eps -25

TNP 2.00 -4 (that’s 50%)

NAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows

DHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)

FRO 2.50- stock 10.50

And half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.

The product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn’t all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days. 

Lastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date.  If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2.

t3_g9hlgt,investing,My bet that travel stocks are going to come roaring back by July.,"Definitions:

IFR: Infection Fatality Rate - percent of those who get the coronavirus die


If your investment is impacted at all by the rona, I recommend reading through /r/covid19 for science based articles and see through the fear mongering most of the news is promoting.


Despite making up 11% of cases (despite being a population much more heavily tested) - [the nursing home population makes up more than 50% of covid deaths in 6 states and is exceptionally higher than average](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-reporting-of-cases-and-deaths-due-to-covid-19-in-long-term-care-facilities/?utm_campaign=KFF-2020-Medicaid&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_g3x0lLoESTRe6UgazNM0z81iW3Vn2rGNK1CDP4D4ifzyzh3tuGLqWllBYM2IqaJi_T63Qg3862U-XrCj9e_td7vKMEg&amp;_hsmi=2)


Now the IFR predictions have dropped over time, starting from 4% to [now, from extrapolating based on the NY Antibody testing, even around 0.5%](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-statewide-antibody-testing-survey-will)


So we have a 0.5% IFR INCLUDING the nursing home population, which as I said before, is only 11% of cases, but account for a LARGE AMOUNT of deaths (in some states 50%)...


So for the average Joe the IFR is much lower, even (dare I say) approaching flu levels (or less). 


With such a large part of the workforce not at serious risk of death, I predict states and countries will successfully reopen while practicing EXTREME CAUTION with at risk residents. It simply does not make sense to have a majority of the country indoors when you can isolate the at risk pretty easily. 


When this information becomes more clear in May, I expect consumers to get less fearful and businesses start going again. And if you are scared about consumer habits, just look at the beaches that reopened, people are itching to get out.

So I think travel stocks will bounce back and many are severely undervalued. I started buying Carnival Cruise today, [small cruise ports are reopening in less than a week](https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/joint-survey-shows-status-northern-european-cruise-ports) and if they have success then there is no reason why cruises won't be sailing come July.","My bet that travel stocks are going to come roaring back by July.Definitions:

IFR: Infection Fatality Rate - percent of those who get the coronavirus die


If your investment is impacted at all by the rona, I recommend reading through /r/covid19 for science based articles and see through the fear mongering most of the news is promoting.


Despite making up 11% of cases (despite being a population much more heavily tested) - [the nursing home population makes up more than 50% of covid deaths in 6 states and is exceptionally higher than average](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-reporting-of-cases-and-deaths-due-to-covid-19-in-long-term-care-facilities/?utm_campaign=KFF-2020-Medicaid&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_g3x0lLoESTRe6UgazNM0z81iW3Vn2rGNK1CDP4D4ifzyzh3tuGLqWllBYM2IqaJi_T63Qg3862U-XrCj9e_td7vKMEg&amp;_hsmi=2)


Now the IFR predictions have dropped over time, starting from 4% to [now, from extrapolating based on the NY Antibody testing, even around 0.5%](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-statewide-antibody-testing-survey-will)


So we have a 0.5% IFR INCLUDING the nursing home population, which as I said before, is only 11% of cases, but account for a LARGE AMOUNT of deaths (in some states 50%)...


So for the average Joe the IFR is much lower, even (dare I say) approaching flu levels (or less). 


With such a large part of the workforce not at serious risk of death, I predict states and countries will successfully reopen while practicing EXTREME CAUTION with at risk residents. It simply does not make sense to have a majority of the country indoors when you can isolate the at risk pretty easily. 


When this information becomes more clear in May, I expect consumers to get less fearful and businesses start going again. And if you are scared about consumer habits, just look at the beaches that reopened, people are itching to get out. You can also look at travel/outdoors subreddits, people want to start doing things again.

I used to buy these two ETFs all throughout 2010-2018.  I also owned stocks and I never held these two ETFs for too long because lots of older people with more financial industry experience than me said it wouldn't work.

Now it's 2020 and I've gotta ask... If we look at a portfolio of TMF/TQQQ bought 50/50 on January 1st is up 28%.

That is better than any stock index.

If we do a back test for multiple years I get higher Sharpe ratios, higher CAGR, the best year performance is significantly more exaggerated than the worst year performance, etc.

You are forced to buy low and sell high... And it's clearly beating the SPY.

If anything it might make sense to add a small position in an actual treasury fund like TLT or IEF to offset some of the leverage... But the back testing says something else.

I used portfolio visualizer and SPY as my benchmark.

Anyone have any legitimate reasons why this is not a good idea?

Edit:

I've added some data.  We are starting in 2010 with $10000 invested equally into TQQQ and TMF.  Then $1000 is added quarterly.  Portfolio is rebalanced quarterly as well.

SPY:

TLDR

considering how the fed has been acting, the precedent is bailouts and socialization of losses.  What real world scenario am I missing where TMF/TQQQ does not continue to outperform a more traditional stock/bond portfolio?

Considering the portfolio is up 28% YTD can we assume it has been debunked that leveraged ETFs can't be held long term.

t3_g9g9l3,investing,Negative effective bond yields - What does this mean?,"I know there has been speculation as to if the US treasury yields will go negative, but there is something I've been contemplating: the effective yield of them already has \*been\* negative for some time.

t3_g9fknn,investing,Tips for using Margin on Interactive Brokers,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty happy with my normal brokerage (Schwab) but am young and am interested in opportunities to take more risk. I opened an IBKR account and my plan is to invest a modest sum (maybe 5k) in some index funds using margin. According to my math, if I transfer 5k into my account and buy an additional 65% of that - $3250 on margin, I can sustain a 20% loss before dipping below the 50% equity requirement ( (.8\*(5000+3250) - 3250) / (.8\*(5000+3250)) \~= 50%)

t3_g9bz9f,investing,Back to Basics: Real Estate Investing,"Hi All,

First of all, I’m a data scientist by profession but a history major by training. So I’ve tried to cite all relevant data points with a (&lt;source&gt;) tag. This allows us to separate debating the data vs. the analysis. I’m also a complete newbie to real estate investing. One of the main goals in fact of this post is to organize my thoughts so far and solicit feedback from more knowledgable individuals. 


As part of a balanced portfolio, I've invested passively in real estate for several years (both public REITs and a small amount in a private platform). As my assets have grown and I'm entering the age to buy a primary residence, I've been trying to educate myself on the housing real estate market. After all, even if you don't own any investment properties the purchase of a home is the largest single financial transaction you'll likely ever make. In fact, if you look at the chart linked below (1, see Sources below) you'll see housing is the single largest asset for households with net worth below 1 million dollars, i.e. ~90% of Americans (2). In fact, even in 2010 (in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis): ""The primary residence represented 62% of the median homeowner’s total assets and 42% of the median home owner’s wealth"" (3).  In fact, reading the Economist recently (obviously in my slippers) I was surprised to discover housing is the world's largest asset class. This HSBC report (avoiding the Economist paywall) cites housing as a $226 trillion (!) asset class at the end of 2016 (4) out of a total net worth in 2018 of ~$360 trillion according to Credit Suisse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even with my casual research, it's clear that real estate is divided into multiple segments including residential, commercial, industrial, farm land, etc. Even the subsector of residential is divided into single family, multi-family, commercial, mobile homes, etc. These segments are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. So far I’ve limited my research to the US residential sector: single family homes, multifamily, and small commercial apartment buildings. Therefore moving forward when I say real estate I will limit the scope to the above US residential housing market, i.e. acquiring individual or personal portfolio of US housing properties. 

&amp;nbsp;



More formally, the purpose of my analysis below is: 

* Understand my options as it pertains to real estate. E.g. is it better to consider “house hacking”, i.e. buying a primary residence and several investment units as part of a duplex, triplex, etc. 
* Avoid making obvious mistakes in the purchase of my primary home

* To summarize what I’ve learned and start to develop opinion about real estate investing more broadly as a complement to public equities investing

* Broaden my knowledge professionally (my clients include large real estate companies) 

* Learn from the community! 

Note: I considered posting this in /r/realestateinvesting, but ultimately my goal is to evaluate real estate vs. other asset classes. Obviously some people will simply prefer real estate for a variety of reasons, but personally my goal is to achieve the greatest return for the least risk and work. I should stress that I love my career (data scientist) and have no intention of quitting, so the last point is particularly important. 

&amp;nbsp;


**Analysis**

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that immediately strikes me as an investor accustomed to public securities, e.g. bonds / stocks, is how odd the real estate market (in particular housing) is in comparison. Having a margin account from a broker, i.e. getting leverage, is often a difficult process reserved for “advanced” investors. In residential real estate, it’s considered “conservative” for an individual to have leverage of 4-5 to 1 (FHA loans, for example, only require 3.5% down in some cases!) . What’s even crazier is that the loan is often issued at only 2-4% over the 10 year US treasury rate.  For example today, April 26th, the 10 year treasure is 0.606% while NerdWallet has a rate of 3.3% for a prime credit score, single family home, primary residence 30 year loan. 



&amp;nbsp;


Perhaps because real estate is the only avenue available for newer investors to take on large amounts leverage immediately, I've seen extreme and, in my opinion, irrational positions on the subject. Even a cursory glance at BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. uncovers multiple posts along the lines of either  ""real estate investing is the best investment ever!"" vs. ""the real estate market is a massive bubble and will crash soon"". I've summarized a few of the common tropes I've seen below with my analysis.


&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a huge bubble, and is going to collapse any day!

As noted above, real estate / housing has numerous segments that are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. Saying that ""real estate"" will crash is like saying the “food industry” will crash. What segment and where? US soybean growers? Fast Food? Argentinian ranchers?  McDonalds in particular? 

Limiting our discussion to US housing: the Case-Shiller national price index (7) shows that home prices dropped ~27% from peak to trough in the Great Financial Crisis over a period of  almost 6 years (Mid 2006 to early 2012). The reason this was such a catastrophic event is that housing had never decreased nationally in a significant way before in the modern era (see Case Schiller home price index). Of course, it’s worth noting that housing had rarely increased rapidly against inflation before. 

Let’s assume we had an equivalent event occur. The Jan 2020 index was at 212, so home prices would decrease by 27% to ~155 (mid 2008 levels). Crucially though, this price drop would be expected to play out for years! During that time vested interests (more on that later) would lobby governments extensively for support, foreign and US investors could form funds to take advantage of the situation, etc. As a reference point there is ~$1.5 trillion available in US private equity funds alone as of January 2020. 

However, it is worth pointing out that this is at the national level. Local real estate markets, particularly those dependent on select industries or foreign investors, could easily see more dramatic price movements. The US census has a really cool chart (22) that shows the inflation adjusted (as of year 2000) median home values every decade by state from 1940 to 2000. We see that Minnesota home values actually dropped from $105,000 in 1980 to $94,500 in 1990, a fall of more than 10%. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Everyone needs a place to live, therefore housing can never go down

Everyone needs a place to eat, but restaurants and grocery stores are famously low margin businesses (5). Farms supply an even more basic need, but many go bankrupt (6). The question isn’t whether housing will go down or not, but whether it will return an attractive rate of return compared to alternative investments. 

It’s also worth pointing out that for most “retail” US housing real estate investors, they are investing in a narrow geographic area. Migration and births/ deaths can play a huge role in the need for housing in a given area. Case in point, NYC may have actually begun losing population to migration in 2017 / 2018 (23). Even more interesting, NYC has experienced a substantial loss due to domestic migration which is almost balanced by foreign immigration / new births (24). If foreign immigration decreases in the post-COVID we would expect NYC’s population to decline more rapidly given current trends. 

It is entirely possible for national housing prices to modestly increase while expensive coastal markets decline significantly, for example. 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; It's supply and demand. There's a nationwide housing shortage so prices can only go up! 

This one has some factual basis. Freddie Mac put out a study in Feb 2020 (18) which indicated that there is a shortage of housing units between 2.5 - 3.3 million units. Some interesting notes about this study is that they consider the “missing” household formation and extrapolate interstate migration trends. As noted below, the US builds ~1.3 million housing units a year, so this reflects ~2 years of housing construction. It’s also worth noting the geographic variation, with “high growth” states like Massachusetts, California, Colorado, etc. seeing ~5% housing deficits vs. states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. seeing housing surpluses of ~2-4%. 

However, a Zillow analysis on our aging population (11) points to a slightly different conclusion. Based on their analysis, an additional ~190,000 home will be released by seniors between 2017-2027 compared to 2007-2017. That number increases by another 250,000 homes annually between 2027-2037. Combined, this is about ~50% of the average annual homes constructed in the US between 2000-2009 at ~900,000. 

Given these slightly conflicting reports, let’s get back to basics. First, let's separate housing into single family homes, multi-family units, and large apartment buildings. Single family homes, particularly near dense and economically vibrant metros, are far more supply constrained. In contrast, multi family units / apartment towers are, barring regulatory issues (see California), less constrained by available land. See Hudson Yards in NYC, the Seaport area in Boston, the Wharf in DC, etc. It's worth noting that due to costs / market demand most of these developments cater to the entry level luxury category and above, but they are new supply. 

I actually wound up looking at US Census projections to get a sense of the long term outlook. By 2030 the Census estimates the population will grow from 334.5 million to 359.4, for a total increase of 24.9 million or an annual increase of 2.49 million (8). In 2019 the Census estimated 888,000 private single family units and 403,000 units in buildings w/ 2+ units were constructed for a grand total of 1,291,000 units (9). The average number of people per US household is 2.52 (10). Some simple math suggests that if we assume each new single family home contains the average number of Americans and each apartment conservatively contains only a single person we get 888,000 * 2.52 + 403,000 = ~2.64 million. 


Now, talking about averages in a national real estate market reminds me of a joke about Mars: on average it's a balmy 72 degrees. But the point still stands that at a high level, theoretical sense there is sufficient  ""housing"" for the US population. The question, as always, is at what price and location? 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a safer investment than the stock market!

This one honestly irritates me. While there are many advantages to real estate I can see, safety is not one of them. It is a highly leveraged, illiquid, extremely concentrated asset when bought individually (i.e not in a REIT). Let’s use an example here. Is there a financial advisoy in the world who would recommend you put your entire investment portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway? Of course not, diversification is the bedrock of modern personal finance. And yet Berkshire Hathaway is an extremely diversified asset manager with well run and capitalized companies ranging from Geico to Berkshire Homes to Berkshire Energy. Oh, and it also has $130 billion (with a B) in cash equivalents. 

I honestly think this impression stems from 3 factors: 

* Almost all asset prices have gone up (barring a few 1-2 month downturns) for 10+ years. There was also a shortage of skilled labor, capital, etc. that dramatically reduced the new supply of housing
* Survivorship bias. The people who fail in real estate tend to limp away quietly. The ones who survive and succeed tout their success loudly. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; You won’t build your wealth in the stock market

One common theme I’m already noticing listening to podcasts, reading blogs, etc. is that many people started investing in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (2009 - 2011). And, in retrospect, it was clearly a great time to buy property! But it was also a great time it turns out to buy almost every investment. 

I plugged in the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 from December 2009 to December 2019 with dividends reinvested (and ignoring the 15-20% long term tax on dividends) (12). It was 13.3%. If you managed to buy at the market bottom of Feb 2009 it was 15.8%! 

The long term annual average of the S&amp;P 500 from 1926 - 2018 is ~10-11% (with dividends reinvested). (13). The S&amp;P has never lost money in a 30 year period with dividends reinvested, see the fantastic book Stocks for the Long Run (14). In fact, if you’re investing before 30 the worst 35 year period (i.e. when you would turn 65) is 6.1% (15). 

Housing, in general, has tracked at or slightly above inflation ( 16). Even a click bait CNBC article (17) about “skyrocketing” home prices states that homes are rising 2x as fast as inflation (i.e. ~4%). If you look at the CNBC chart for inflation adjusted prices, you’ll see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 1940 to 2000. Let’s do this same exercise again with the Average Sales Price of Homes from Fred (i.e. Fed economic data) (18). In Q1 1963 the average sales price of a house was $19,300. In Q4 2019 it was $382,300. That is a CAGR of ~5.38% over ~57 years. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that while real estate does have some tax advantages, there are also property taxes, maintenance, etc. 

But it’s harder than that. Because real estate is an illiquid asset. In general, illiquid assets require higher returns than 
the equivalent liquid asset because of the inconvenience / risk of not having the ability to transact frequently. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Case study of real estate purchase:**

I’d like to focus the rest of my analysis on an area that many members of BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. seem to gloss over: credit. I was surprised to see that for first time home buyers, 72% made a down payment of 6% or less according in Dec 2018 according to (27). This would imply prices only have to decrease 6% to put these new homebuyers underwater, i.e. owe more after a sale than their mortgage. But  this fails to take into account costs associated with buying a property, which are substantial at 2-5% for closing according to Zillow (28). Costs for selling a property are even more substantial, ranging from 8-10% according to Zillow (29). This means that sellers only putting down 6% could be underwater (in the sense that they couldn’t sell without providing cash during the sale) with even modest price decreases when taking into account these transactional costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


Obviously there are ways to reduce these costs, so let’s walk through a hypothetical example of the median valued home of ~$200,000. 

&amp;nbsp;


A young, first time home-buyer puts down 10%, or $20k, and takes out a mortgage for $180,000. They also pay (optimistically) closing costs of 2% for $4000. Luckily, they bought in a hot housing market and prices increased 5% (real) over the next 5 years. Their house is now worth ~$255,000. They sell their house and again, optimistically, closing costs are only 4%. This means they pay $10,200. Consequently, after netting out costs we calculate naively that they would make $255k - $10k - $4k - $200k (original purchase price of home) = $41k. Given they only invested $20k of their own money, this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~15.4%, which is handily above the S&amp;P 500’s average. This is the naive calculation I first made, but as we’ll see it is deeply flawed. First, let’s look at costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


WalletHub has a really nice chart that shows (conveniently) property taxes on a $205,000 home across all 50 states (30). The average American household spends $2375 on property taxes, so let’s assume a little less and go for $1500. So 5 years x $1500 = $7500. 


&amp;nbsp;


For home maintenance, the consensus seems to be ~1% annually for home maintenance with wide variation. We’ll assume that’s $2000 off the base price, so $2000 * 5 = $10,000.  (31).


&amp;nbsp;


For homeowner’s insurance, Bankrate (32) provides a nice graph that shows the average annual cost for a $300,000 dwelling across all states and then a separate chart for costs based on dwelling coverage. For a $200,000 dwelling coverage we have a figure of $1806 per year, so over 5 years we have $1800 * 5 = $9000. 


&amp;nbsp;


Finally we need to calculate the interest on the debt. One thing that I didn’t realize until I looked at an amortization table how front-loaded the interest payments are. Case in point, I plugged in the $180,000 loan into the amortization calculator (34) using a 3.5% interest rate and saw that we pay on average ~$6000 each year in interest vs. only ~$3800 to principal. 


&amp;nbsp;


**So lets’s run the new numbers.**

You sell your home still for $255,000. After 5 years, your mortgage is now ~$160000 (i.e. you paid off 20,000 over 5 years, or ~$4k per year). So after the sale  you are left with ~$95,000. The buying and selling costs remain the same as before, so we subtract the $14k for $81,000. We also then subtract $7500 (property taxes), $10,000 (home maintenance), $9000 (homeowners insurance)  which gives us $54,500.


&amp;nbsp;


We paid ~$9,700 each year in mortgage interest + principle (~6000 interest and $3700 principal). So  5 * 9700 = $48,500.

&amp;nbsp;



So, net of everything we get $255,000 - $160,000 (remaining mortgage) - $48,500 (mortgage payments over 5 years) - $14k (buying / selling costs) - $7500 (property taxes) - $10,000 (home maintenance) - $9000 (home insurance) =  $6000. And we put down $20,000 as a downpayment, for a net compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of negative $21.4%. 


&amp;nbsp;

That is truly an astounding result. We had 10x leverage on an asset that went up 5% each year for 5 years and we somehow lost money on our “investment” of a down payment? Keep in mind we also used fairly optimistic numbers (particularly home price appreciation) and didn’t factor in PMI, etc. On the flip side, this home provided shelter, i.e. you didn’t pay rent. That’s a massive “avoided” cost and I don’t mean to minimize it. But the point here is that many homebuyers I’ve spoken to fail to account for the substantial costs of home ownership and expect their primary resident to generate a substantial return. 


&amp;nbsp;


Now, of course, for real estate investing you would likely either a) hold the property for less time and attempt to flip it via forced appreciation or b) have tenants in the property. Let’s focus on b) because frankly that’s more of my interest. From what little research I’ve done flipping houses requires much more  time that’s incompatible with my day job. 


&amp;nbsp;


I went ahead and used the rental price calculator I found online at (36) to calculate the return. I used a rent of $1300 monthly, a bit lower than the average national rent of $1476 (35) because our home price was also lower than the national average. I assumed a low vacancy rate of 5%, and no other expenses beyond the ones cited above (i.e. I didn’t assume property management, higher loan interest rate, higher property taxes). 


&amp;nbsp;


The calculator spit back a 5 year internal rate of return (a metric in this case useful  to compare against the securities markets)  of 27.79% return, i.e. a profit of $63k on an initial investment of $20k. The IRR as I understand it captures the time value of money, basically accounting for when you made various returns (37). E.g if an investment over 30 years pays nothing then gives you a lump sum payment at the end that’s very different than if it pays 1/30th of that lump sum every year. It’s useful in this case for comparing against the stock market because the IRR takes all future cash flows  back to a net present value of 0, i.e. as if we invested all the money immediately. 


&amp;nbsp;


**&amp;Now let’s do some scenario modeling (originally we had 10% down, 3.5% interest rate for an IRR of ~28%):**
 
* Let’s assume we have to put down 20%:  now we have a 19% IRR
* 20% down payment and a 5.5% (instead of 3.5%) interest rate: 14.7% IRR
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year instead of 5% with 10% down payment: 20%
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year with 20% down payment: 12.65%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 10% down payment: 4.26%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 20% down payment: -1.28%

This scenario for me demonstrated a number of interesting properties. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Owning a home for even a moderate amount of time (~5 years) will likely not build substantial wealth unless there is truly massive home appreciation. The transactional costs are too high, the ongoing costs are substantial, etc. And of course I’ve neglected to include all the remodeling, furniture, etc. that every home owner I’ve met has spent money on 
* With regards to real estate investing, home price appreciation covers up a magnitude of sins, particularly if coupled with a low cost of debt. Changing nothing but the home price appreciation changes the investment from incredible (28% IRR) to about 1/2 the expected return of the S&amp;P 500 (4.26%)
* Real estate, whether investing or owning a primary residence, has limited to negative cash flow initially. The loan is amortized so that all early payments go to interest, maintenance is expensive, etc. 
* To sanity check these figures, I went and looked at the SEC filings of Invitation Homes which owns 80,000 single family homes in the US. In 2019, Invitation Homes made ~$1.764 billion on rent + other property income while spending a combine ~$730 million on property maintenance + management.(49) . That’s about ~41% of the total property income, which aligns with the rental calculator above (rent payments fo 1300 vs ~$570 for maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy, etc.). That honestly makes me nervous however, as Invitation Homes theoretically has the scale to centralize and minimize maintenance costs. While I could certainly substitute “sweat equity” for some repairs, it strikes me that it would be foolish to assume my costs would be lower than Invitation Homes’


&amp;nbsp;


**401k analysis**

As I mentioned above, one of the big questions around real estate investing that I rarely see asked is “is it an appreciably better investment than the alternatives”? For W2 workers, which is ~50% of private sector workers, this question becomes even more pertinent because 401ks have massive tax benefits. In fact, only 33% of US households own taxable accounts outside of a 401k, which means the vast bulk of US households either have no accounts, 38%, or own only a retirement account like a 401k, 29%, according to (39). Let’s assume we have a middle to upper middle class worker making ~70k (this puts them roughly at the 75% percentile). They want to invest, and see two options: 

* Invest $20,000 post-tax in a downpayment  on a $200,000 investment property just like in the above analysis (we’ll assume closing costs just get baked into the final net gain) 
* Invest the equivalent amount of post-tax dollars into their 401k. You can probably see where I’m going with this by the use of “post-tax”. 


&amp;nbsp;


At a salary of $70k and assuming you took the $12k standard deduction, you would still see much of your income fall into the 22% tax bracket. While certain states charge no income tax, they generally make it up in much higher sales / property taxes, so let’s also assume a 3% state income tax (40). This means that if you invest $19,500 in a 401k (the maximum in 2020) that’s equivalent to only $14,625 post-tax (because the $19,500 would be taxed ~25% before it got to you). That leaves almost $6000 when compared with the down payment figure above, which is coincidentally the exact IRA contribution limit for 2020! The math for deductions for the IRA gets painful, but we can assume a deduction of ~$1500 (i.e. 25% of 6000). Now, if your work offers an HSA it gets even better, because those contributions are tax-free even from social security (which is typically a 6.2% tax) + medicaid (1.45%). This means that if you contribute the $3500 limit, that’s equivalent to only $2300 post-tax. 


&amp;nbsp;


This is getting rather long, so for the sake of simplicity we can basically say that in lieu of putting down a $20,000 post-tax downpayment on an investment property you could instead invest $19500 + $6000 + $3500 = $29000 into the stock market. What’s more, fees for well managed 401ks through Vanguard, Schwab are often ~0.25% (i.e. $72 annually on the $29k above). 


&amp;nbsp;


If we assume the average S&amp;P 500 index returns of 10% (we’ll ignore the $72 annually in expenses and of course there are no taxes), we would see $29k compounded over 5 years = $47,809. Since we’re investing the money all immediately, this is (I believe) more or less equivalent to the IRR rate. 


&amp;nbsp;


So, what do we need to achieve to beat that return with our investment property? Well, we previously assumed a blistering 5% real home price appreciation. With inflation at ~2%, that’s a nominal 7% home price appreciation. According to both Zillow and Core logic, Idaho is the state with the fastest home appreciation values pre-COVID at ~9%. We’re essentially predicting close to this level for 5 years, which is quite rare. In August 2019, US home prices nationally were gaining ~2.6% according to (41).

Let’s plug those numbers into our rental property calculator from above. At a 10% down payment, 3.5% interest rate, and 2.6% home price appreciation we see an IRR of 18% per year. Game, set, match, real estate, right?


&amp;nbsp;


Well, sort of. Right now we are assuming optimistic projections about maintenance (1%), closing costs (2%), and selling costs (4%). What if we bump those up to the averages cited by Zillow (3% and 8%)? Uh-oh, now we’re down to 12.38%. Okay, but what if we assume rent goes up by the same amount, ~2%? Great! Now we’re back up to 14% IRR. But if we assume all the other expenses like home insurance and maintenance go up 2% a year as well, we’re back down to 11%. 


&amp;nbsp;



We could go on forever, but the point is that real estate (particularly for rental properties) are extremely sensitive to assumptions you make on a number of factors. Given the risk, illiquidity, and work involved with a real estate property I would want to see a substantially higher return than the tax advantaged, hands off 10% my 401k gives me. I didn’t even include the typical 3% match for the 401k, which would have added $2100 to the initial investment amount and increased the 5 year return to $51,272.


&amp;nbsp;



The bottom line in my mind is that for most W2 workers who have access to pre-tax investments, they should max them out first. If you’re lucky enough to be able to max out all of the above pre-tax accounts + get a 3% match (i.e. $31k total) every year, after 15 years at a 10% return you’ll have $1.2 million. In 30 years you’ll have $6.8 million. And again, keep in mind that maxing out your pre-tax accounts only “costs” you ~$20k, because that’s what you would get after taxes. And you’ll have “made” those millions without spending a single hour outside of your day job working. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Based on the above analysis and calculations, here’s what I’ve come away with as a newbie to real estate investing:**


* Real estate investing involves significant risk. Achieving high returns relies upon either significant home appreciation or accurately calculating several key inputs (rental rates, maintenance costs, etc.). The past decades strong home appreciation has likely saved some investors from faulty assumptions, simply because their highly leveraged investment increased in value
* Given the significant transaction, maintenance, tax, and other costs simply buying and living in a single family home is not guaranteed to build substantial wealth in the short term (i.e. &lt; 10 years) even with significant price appreciation. 
* The story of real estate investing is really the story of credit availability. Low interest rates, widespread credit, etc. allow investors to take on significant leverage and potentially achieve high returns. On the flip side, if credit tightens we could see substantial movements in real estate as valuations adjust to the more expensive or less available leverage 
* Personally, I would want to see at least 12+% returns annually before I invested in real estate directly vs. a diversified stock portfolio. Potentially having a cash flow negative, illiquid, highly leveraged asset is a risk that I want to be compensated for by a higher return. Obviously there are many advantages to real estate I’ve not yet learned in depth about (e.g. taxes), so perhaps this premium will change slightly in my mind in the future
* If you’re a younger, W2 wage earning in the US with the access and ability to contribute to a 401k, IRA, and HSA you should do that first before even considering real estate investing. The tax advantages are immense, the time investment is essentially nothing, and historically you are guaranteed, at the absolute worst, a 6.5% annualized return if you wait for 35 years. Plus a well diversified 401k fund, like a Vanguard target retirement fund, may very well include REITs
* The exception here of course is doing something like house hacking, etc. where you are combining your primary residence with an investment. I’m not sophisticated enough yet to run the numbers there, but it seems reasonable on the surface 


&amp;nbsp;


**Some thoughts on the future:**

Forecasting is always risky, but at the same time we all have to form an opinion on where the future is headed. My general thoughts are that crisis tend to accelerate existing trends rather than create new ones. There were already recession concerns in late 2019, and US GDP growth expectations had been downgraded to ~2.0% by the OECD even before COVID (45), albeit with slight optimism around the Phase 1 trade deal with China.  Geopolitical tension and capital controls in China had led to mainland Chinese investors slowing their investments in US real estate and increasing dispositions (47). 

* While there is certainly a housing shortage, even in high growth states we see housing “deficits” according to Fannie Mae of ~5%. While this is clearly substantial, shifting migration patterns, regulatory changes, household preferences (e.g. telecommuting) could easily shift the balance. It’s far from certain in my mind that housing will remain supply constrained in the medium term (i.e. &gt; 3 years) 
* In December 2019, Zillow was already forecasting slowing home price and rental appreciation to modest 2.8% &amp; 2.3% respectively (42) 
* As of March 31 2020, Zillow now forecasts home price appreciation at -1.5% nationally. 
* We are seeing tightening mortgage credit, particularly for jumbo loans that are essentially for high priced real estate markets (44). Mortgage services, i.e. non-bank companies like Quicken, have been hit hard by the mortgage forbearance regulations (although relief measures have been enacted) 
* The CBO is currently forecasting the unemployment rate to remain &gt;10% until 2021 (48). Even if that proves wildly pessimistic, it’s highly probably that the tepid wage gains of the last few years will slow further or even reverse 
* Ultimately with  slowing wage gains and reduced credit in the short term it is hard to see how consumers retain their purchasing power to drive rents / real estate prices substantially higher. 
* On the flip side, central banks globally have injected trillions of dollars of liquidity into the global economy. This has driven down yields in traditional safe havens, e.g. investment grade corporate and sovereign bonds. The question becomes, where does this money go? Does it favor real estate over stocks? Does it lead to inflation, deflation, stagflation? 
* Local &amp; state governments are facing massive budget shortfalls due to dramatically lower revenues (e.g. sales taxes) and higher costs (unemployment insurance, healthcare, etc.). If the federal government does not backstop these revenues, will we see higher state / local taxes or cutbacks in services? 
* As mentioned previously, the tax law changes of 2017 dramatically affected how individuals / households approach their federal taxes. In particular, it is now far less advantageous to itemize property taxes, state taxes, mortgage interest, etc. Mark Zandi (50) of Moody’s analytics provided some interesting analysis that suggested the tax law changes had already impacted higher cost markets. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue, accelerate, or reverse post COVID. 
* The question now becomes how investors, particularly those who entered late in the cycle and lack substantial equity buffers, will deal with conditions. A V shaped recovery would likely see minimal disruption as investors are able to cope with disrupted cash flows for several months. A longer recession would see over-leveraged investors forced to short-sell properties 
* I’m particularly struck by the fact that according to at least one source (27) ~72% of first time home buyers put down 6% or less. These recent buyers lack the equity buffer to deal with any material decline in housing prices, while the modest down payment suggests they may also lack substantial cash reserves to deal with an economic shock. 
* There also seems to me a disconnect between commercial and residential real estate I don’t fully understand. Take a well capitalized and diversified REIT like Brookfield Property Partners. This REIT is currently offering a 14%+ yield. Of course many of their properties like urban office / retail space are getting hammered by COVID. But if we’re assuming that centrally located, urban commercial office &amp; retail spaces are substantially less valuable than pre-COVID, what does that say more broadly about dense urban real estate? After all, if people work from home and don’t go out to commercial real estate spaces, why bother paying a premium in living expenses? 

From my point of view, I’m interested in seeing how the market reacts over the next 3-6 months. Do sellers react by rapidly putting properties on the market before it’s “too late”? Are there enough prime  buyers given the tightening credit, particularly for expensive coastal markets, to absorb a spike in listings? As Warren Buffett once said: “""At rare and unpredictable intervals...credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation--usually win, occasionally die--may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company's upside but does not share in its downside.” We shall see.

First of all, I’m a data scientist by profession but a history major by training. So I’ve tried to cite all relevant data points with a (&lt;source&gt;) tag. This allows us to separate debating the data vs. the analysis. I’m also a complete newbie to real estate investing. One of the main goals in fact of this post is to organize my thoughts so far and solicit feedback from more knowledgable individuals. 


As part of a balanced portfolio, I've invested passively in real estate for several years (both public REITs and a small amount in a private platform). As my assets have grown and I'm entering the age to buy a primary residence, I've been trying to educate myself on the housing real estate market. After all, even if you don't own any investment properties the purchase of a home is the largest single financial transaction you'll likely ever make. In fact, if you look at the chart linked below (1, see Sources below) you'll see housing is the single largest asset for households with net worth below 1 million dollars, i.e. ~90% of Americans (2). In fact, even in 2010 (in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis): ""The primary residence represented 62% of the median homeowner’s total assets and 42% of the median home owner’s wealth"" (3).  In fact, reading the Economist recently (obviously in my slippers) I was surprised to discover housing is the world's largest asset class. This HSBC report (avoiding the Economist paywall) cites housing as a $226 trillion (!) asset class at the end of 2016 (4) out of a total net worth in 2018 of ~$360 trillion according to Credit Suisse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even with my casual research, it's clear that real estate is divided into multiple segments including residential, commercial, industrial, farm land, etc. Even the subsector of residential is divided into single family, multi-family, commercial, mobile homes, etc. These segments are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. So far I’ve limited my research to the US residential sector: single family homes, multifamily, and small commercial apartment buildings. Therefore moving forward when I say real estate I will limit the scope to the above US residential housing market, i.e. acquiring individual or personal portfolio of US housing properties. 

&amp;nbsp;



More formally, the purpose of my analysis below is: 

* Understand my options as it pertains to real estate. E.g. is it better to consider “house hacking”, i.e. buying a primary residence and several investment units as part of a duplex, triplex, etc. 
* Avoid making obvious mistakes in the purchase of my primary home

* To summarize what I’ve learned and start to develop opinion about real estate investing more broadly as a complement to public equities investing

* Broaden my knowledge professionally (my clients include large real estate companies) 

* Learn from the community! 

Note: I considered posting this in /r/realestateinvesting, but ultimately my goal is to evaluate real estate vs. other asset classes. Obviously some people will simply prefer real estate for a variety of reasons, but personally my goal is to achieve the greatest return for the least risk and work. I should stress that I love my career (data scientist) and have no intention of quitting, so the last point is particularly important. 

&amp;nbsp;


**Analysis**

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that immediately strikes me as an investor accustomed to public securities, e.g. bonds / stocks, is how odd the real estate market (in particular housing) is in comparison. Having a margin account from a broker, i.e. getting leverage, is often a difficult process reserved for “advanced” investors. In residential real estate, it’s considered “conservative” for an individual to have leverage of 4-5 to 1 (FHA loans, for example, only require 3.5% down in some cases!) . What’s even crazier is that the loan is often issued at only 2-4% over the 10 year US treasury rate.  For example today, April 26th, the 10 year treasure is 0.606% while NerdWallet has a rate of 3.3% for a prime credit score, single family home, primary residence 30 year loan. 



&amp;nbsp;


Perhaps because real estate is the only avenue available for newer investors to take on large amounts leverage immediately, I've seen extreme and, in my opinion, irrational positions on the subject. Even a cursory glance at BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. uncovers multiple posts along the lines of either  ""real estate investing is the best investment ever!"" vs. ""the real estate market is a massive bubble and will crash soon"". I've summarized a few of the common tropes I've seen below with my analysis.


&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a huge bubble, and is going to collapse any day!

As noted above, real estate / housing has numerous segments that are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. Saying that ""real estate"" will crash is like saying the “food industry” will crash. What segment and where? US soybean growers? Fast Food? Argentinian ranchers?  McDonalds in particular? 

Limiting our discussion to US housing: the Case-Shiller national price index (7) shows that home prices dropped ~27% from peak to trough in the Great Financial Crisis over a period of  almost 6 years (Mid 2006 to early 2012). The reason this was such a catastrophic event is that housing had never decreased nationally in a significant way before in the modern era (see Case Schiller home price index). Of course, it’s worth noting that housing had rarely increased rapidly against inflation before. 

Let’s assume we had an equivalent event occur. The Jan 2020 index was at 212, so home prices would decrease by 27% to ~155 (mid 2008 levels). Crucially though, this price drop would be expected to play out for years! During that time vested interests (more on that later) would lobby governments extensively for support, foreign and US investors could form funds to take advantage of the situation, etc. As a reference point there is ~$1.5 trillion available in US private equity funds alone as of January 2020. 

However, it is worth pointing out that this is at the national level. Local real estate markets, particularly those dependent on select industries or foreign investors, could easily see more dramatic price movements. The US census has a really cool chart (22) that shows the inflation adjusted (as of year 2000) median home values every decade by state from 1940 to 2000. We see that Minnesota home values actually dropped from $105,000 in 1980 to $94,500 in 1990, a fall of more than 10%. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Everyone needs a place to live, therefore housing can never go down

Everyone needs a place to eat, but restaurants and grocery stores are famously low margin businesses (5). Farms supply an even more basic need, but many go bankrupt (6). The question isn’t whether housing will go down or not, but whether it will return an attractive rate of return compared to alternative investments. 

It’s also worth pointing out that for most “retail” US housing real estate investors, they are investing in a narrow geographic area. Migration and births/ deaths can play a huge role in the need for housing in a given area. Case in point, NYC may have actually begun losing population to migration in 2017 / 2018 (23). Even more interesting, NYC has experienced a substantial loss due to domestic migration which is almost balanced by foreign immigration / new births (24). If foreign immigration decreases in the post-COVID we would expect NYC’s population to decline more rapidly given current trends. 

It is entirely possible for national housing prices to modestly increase while expensive coastal markets decline significantly, for example. 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; It's supply and demand. There's a nationwide housing shortage so prices can only go up! 

This one has some factual basis. Freddie Mac put out a study in Feb 2020 (18) which indicated that there is a shortage of housing units between 2.5 - 3.3 million units. Some interesting notes about this study is that they consider the “missing” household formation and extrapolate interstate migration trends. As noted below, the US builds ~1.3 million housing units a year, so this reflects ~2 years of housing construction. It’s also worth noting the geographic variation, with “high growth” states like Massachusetts, California, Colorado, etc. seeing ~5% housing deficits vs. states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. seeing housing surpluses of ~2-4%. 

However, a Zillow analysis on our aging population (11) points to a slightly different conclusion. Based on their analysis, an additional ~190,000 home will be released by seniors between 2017-2027 compared to 2007-2017. That number increases by another 250,000 homes annually between 2027-2037. Combined, this is about ~50% of the average annual homes constructed in the US between 2000-2009 at ~900,000. 

Given these slightly conflicting reports, let’s get back to basics. First, let's separate housing into single family homes, multi-family units, and large apartment buildings. Single family homes, particularly near dense and economically vibrant metros, are far more supply constrained. In contrast, multi family units / apartment towers are, barring regulatory issues (see California), less constrained by available land. See Hudson Yards in NYC, the Seaport area in Boston, the Wharf in DC, etc. It's worth noting that due to costs / market demand most of these developments cater to the entry level luxury category and above, but they are new supply. 

I actually wound up looking at US Census projections to get a sense of the long term outlook. By 2030 the Census estimates the population will grow from 334.5 million to 359.4, for a total increase of 24.9 million or an annual increase of 2.49 million (8). In 2019 the Census estimated 888,000 private single family units and 403,000 units in buildings w/ 2+ units were constructed for a grand total of 1,291,000 units (9). The average number of people per US household is 2.52 (10). Some simple math suggests that if we assume each new single family home contains the average number of Americans and each apartment conservatively contains only a single person we get 888,000 * 2.52 + 403,000 = ~2.64 million. 


Now, talking about averages in a national real estate market reminds me of a joke about Mars: on average it's a balmy 72 degrees. But the point still stands that at a high level, theoretical sense there is sufficient  ""housing"" for the US population. The question, as always, is at what price and location? 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a safer investment than the stock market!

This one honestly irritates me. While there are many advantages to real estate I can see, safety is not one of them. It is a highly leveraged, illiquid, extremely concentrated asset when bought individually (i.e not in a REIT). Let’s use an example here. Is there a financial advisoy in the world who would recommend you put your entire investment portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway? Of course not, diversification is the bedrock of modern personal finance. And yet Berkshire Hathaway is an extremely diversified asset manager with well run and capitalized companies ranging from Geico to Berkshire Homes to Berkshire Energy. Oh, and it also has $130 billion (with a B) in cash equivalents. 

I honestly think this impression stems from 3 factors: 

* Almost all asset prices have gone up (barring a few 1-2 month downturns) for 10+ years. There was also a shortage of skilled labor, capital, etc. that dramatically reduced the new supply of housing
* Survivorship bias. The people who fail in real estate tend to limp away quietly. The ones who survive and succeed tout their success loudly. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; You won’t build your wealth in the stock market

One common theme I’m already noticing listening to podcasts, reading blogs, etc. is that many people started investing in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (2009 - 2011). And, in retrospect, it was clearly a great time to buy property! But it was also a great time it turns out to buy almost every investment. 

I plugged in the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 from December 2009 to December 2019 with dividends reinvested (and ignoring the 15-20% long term tax on dividends) (12). It was 13.3%. If you managed to buy at the market bottom of Feb 2009 it was 15.8%! 

The long term annual average of the S&amp;P 500 from 1926 - 2018 is ~10-11% (with dividends reinvested). (13). The S&amp;P has never lost money in a 30 year period with dividends reinvested, see the fantastic book Stocks for the Long Run (14). In fact, if you’re investing before 30 the worst 35 year period (i.e. when you would turn 65) is 6.1% (15). 

Housing, in general, has tracked at or slightly above inflation ( 16). Even a click bait CNBC article (17) about “skyrocketing” home prices states that homes are rising 2x as fast as inflation (i.e. ~4%). If you look at the CNBC chart for inflation adjusted prices, you’ll see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 1940 to 2000. Let’s do this same exercise again with the Average Sales Price of Homes from Fred (i.e. Fed economic data) (18). In Q1 1963 the average sales price of a house was $19,300. In Q4 2019 it was $382,300. That is a CAGR of ~5.38% over ~57 years. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that while real estate does have some tax advantages, there are also property taxes, maintenance, etc. 

But it’s harder than that. Because real estate is an illiquid asset. In general, illiquid assets require higher returns than 
the equivalent liquid asset because of the inconvenience / risk of not having the ability to transact frequently. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Case study of real estate purchase:**

I’d like to focus the rest of my analysis on an area that many members of BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. seem to gloss over: credit. I was surprised to see that for first time home buyers, 72% made a down payment of 6% or less according in Dec 2018 according to (27). This would imply prices only have to decrease 6% to put these new homebuyers underwater, i.e. owe more after a sale than their mortgage. But  this fails to take into account costs associated with buying a property, which are substantial at 2-5% for closing according to Zillow (28). Costs for selling a property are even more substantial, ranging from 8-10% according to Zillow (29). This means that sellers only putting down 6% could be underwater (in the sense that they couldn’t sell without providing cash during the sale) with even modest price decreases when taking into account these transactional costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


Obviously there are ways to reduce these costs, so let’s walk through a hypothetical example of the median valued home of ~$200,000. 

&amp;nbsp;


A young, first time home-buyer puts down 10%, or $20k, and takes out a mortgage for $180,000. They also pay (optimistically) closing costs of 2% for $4000. Luckily, they bought in a hot housing market and prices increased 5% (real) over the next 5 years. Their house is now worth ~$255,000. They sell their house and again, optimistically, closing costs are only 4%. This means they pay $10,200. Consequently, after netting out costs we calculate naively that they would make $255k - $10k - $4k - $200k (original purchase price of home) = $41k. Given they only invested $20k of their own money, this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~15.4%, which is handily above the S&amp;P 500’s average. This is the naive calculation I first made, but as we’ll see it is deeply flawed. First, let’s look at costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


WalletHub has a really nice chart that shows (conveniently) property taxes on a $205,000 home across all 50 states (30). The average American household spends $2375 on property taxes, so let’s assume a little less and go for $1500. So 5 years x $1500 = $7500. 


&amp;nbsp;


For home maintenance, the consensus seems to be ~1% annually for home maintenance with wide variation. We’ll assume that’s $2000 off the base price, so $2000 * 5 = $10,000.  (31).


&amp;nbsp;


For homeowner’s insurance, Bankrate (32) provides a nice graph that shows the average annual cost for a $300,000 dwelling across all states and then a separate chart for costs based on dwelling coverage. For a $200,000 dwelling coverage we have a figure of $1806 per year, so over 5 years we have $1800 * 5 = $9000. 


&amp;nbsp;


Finally we need to calculate the interest on the debt. One thing that I didn’t realize until I looked at an amortization table how front-loaded the interest payments are. Case in point, I plugged in the $180,000 loan into the amortization calculator (34) using a 3.5% interest rate and saw that we pay on average ~$6000 each year in interest vs. only ~$3800 to principal. 


&amp;nbsp;


**So lets’s run the new numbers.**

You sell your home still for $255,000. After 5 years, your mortgage is now ~$160000 (i.e. you paid off 20,000 over 5 years, or ~$4k per year). So after the sale  you are left with ~$95,000. The buying and selling costs remain the same as before, so we subtract the $14k for $81,000. We also then subtract $7500 (property taxes), $10,000 (home maintenance), $9000 (homeowners insurance)  which gives us $54,500.


&amp;nbsp;


We paid ~$9,700 each year in mortgage interest + principle (~6000 interest and $3700 principal). So  5 * 9700 = $48,500.

&amp;nbsp;



So, net of everything we get $255,000 - $160,000 (remaining mortgage) - $48,500 (mortgage payments over 5 years) - $14k (buying / selling costs) - $7500 (property taxes) - $10,000 (home maintenance) - $9000 (home insurance) =  $6000. And we put down $20,000 as a downpayment, for a net compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of negative $21.4%. 


&amp;nbsp;

That is truly an astounding result. We had 10x leverage on an asset that went up 5% each year for 5 years and we somehow lost money on our “investment” of a down payment? Keep in mind we also used fairly optimistic numbers (particularly home price appreciation) and didn’t factor in PMI, etc. On the flip side, this home provided shelter, i.e. you didn’t pay rent. That’s a massive “avoided” cost and I don’t mean to minimize it. But the point here is that many homebuyers I’ve spoken to fail to account for the substantial costs of home ownership and expect their primary resident to generate a substantial return. 


&amp;nbsp;


Now, of course, for real estate investing you would likely either a) hold the property for less time and attempt to flip it via forced appreciation or b) have tenants in the property. Let’s focus on b) because frankly that’s more of my interest. From what little research I’ve done flipping houses requires much more  time that’s incompatible with my day job. 


&amp;nbsp;


I went ahead and used the rental price calculator I found online at (36) to calculate the return. I used a rent of $1300 monthly, a bit lower than the average national rent of $1476 (35) because our home price was also lower than the national average. I assumed a low vacancy rate of 5%, and no other expenses beyond the ones cited above (i.e. I didn’t assume property management, higher loan interest rate, higher property taxes). 


&amp;nbsp;


The calculator spit back a 5 year internal rate of return (a metric in this case useful  to compare against the securities markets)  of 27.79% return, i.e. a profit of $63k on an initial investment of $20k. The IRR as I understand it captures the time value of money, basically accounting for when you made various returns (37). E.g if an investment over 30 years pays nothing then gives you a lump sum payment at the end that’s very different than if it pays 1/30th of that lump sum every year. It’s useful in this case for comparing against the stock market because the IRR takes all future cash flows  back to a net present value of 0, i.e. as if we invested all the money immediately. 


&amp;nbsp;


**&amp;Now let’s do some scenario modeling (originally we had 10% down, 3.5% interest rate for an IRR of ~28%):**
 
* Let’s assume we have to put down 20%:  now we have a 19% IRR
* 20% down payment and a 5.5% (instead of 3.5%) interest rate: 14.7% IRR
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year instead of 5% with 10% down payment: 20%
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year with 20% down payment: 12.65%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 10% down payment: 4.26%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 20% down payment: -1.28%

This scenario for me demonstrated a number of interesting properties. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Owning a home for even a moderate amount of time (~5 years) will likely not build substantial wealth unless there is truly massive home appreciation. The transactional costs are too high, the ongoing costs are substantial, etc. And of course I’ve neglected to include all the remodeling, furniture, etc. that every home owner I’ve met has spent money on 
* With regards to real estate investing, home price appreciation covers up a magnitude of sins, particularly if coupled with a low cost of debt. Changing nothing but the home price appreciation changes the investment from incredible (28% IRR) to about 1/2 the expected return of the S&amp;P 500 (4.26%)
* Real estate, whether investing or owning a primary residence, has limited to negative cash flow initially. The loan is amortized so that all early payments go to interest, maintenance is expensive, etc. 
* To sanity check these figures, I went and looked at the SEC filings of Invitation Homes which owns 80,000 single family homes in the US. In 2019, Invitation Homes made ~$1.764 billion on rent + other property income while spending a combine ~$730 million on property maintenance + management.(49) . That’s about ~41% of the total property income, which aligns with the rental calculator above (rent payments fo 1300 vs ~$570 for maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy, etc.). That honestly makes me nervous however, as Invitation Homes theoretically has the scale to centralize and minimize maintenance costs. While I could certainly substitute “sweat equity” for some repairs, it strikes me that it would be foolish to assume my costs would be lower than Invitation Homes’


&amp;nbsp;


**401k analysis**

As I mentioned above, one of the big questions around real estate investing that I rarely see asked is “is it an appreciably better investment than the alternatives”? For W2 workers, which is ~50% of private sector workers, this question becomes even more pertinent because 401ks have massive tax benefits. In fact, only 33% of US households own taxable accounts outside of a 401k, which means the vast bulk of US households either have no accounts, 38%, or own only a retirement account like a 401k, 29%, according to (39). Let’s assume we have a middle to upper middle class worker making ~70k (this puts them roughly at the 75% percentile). They want to invest, and see two options: 

* Invest $20,000 post-tax in a downpayment  on a $200,000 investment property just like in the above analysis (we’ll assume closing costs just get baked into the final net gain) 
* Invest the equivalent amount of post-tax dollars into their 401k. You can probably see where I’m going with this by the use of “post-tax”. 


&amp;nbsp;


At a salary of $70k and assuming you took the $12k standard deduction, you would still see much of your income fall into the 22% tax bracket. While certain states charge no income tax, they generally make it up in much higher sales / property taxes, so let’s also assume a 3% state income tax (40). This means that if you invest $19,500 in a 401k (the maximum in 2020) that’s equivalent to only $14,625 post-tax (because the $19,500 would be taxed ~25% before it got to you). That leaves almost $6000 when compared with the down payment figure above, which is coincidentally the exact IRA contribution limit for 2020! The math for deductions for the IRA gets painful, but we can assume a deduction of ~$1500 (i.e. 25% of 6000). Now, if your work offers an HSA it gets even better, because those contributions are tax-free even from social security (which is typically a 6.2% tax) + medicaid (1.45%). This means that if you contribute the $3500 limit, that’s equivalent to only $2300 post-tax. 


&amp;nbsp;


This is getting rather long, so for the sake of simplicity we can basically say that in lieu of putting down a $20,000 post-tax downpayment on an investment property you could instead invest $19500 + $6000 + $3500 = $29000 into the stock market. What’s more, fees for well managed 401ks through Vanguard, Schwab are often ~0.25% (i.e. $72 annually on the $29k above). 


&amp;nbsp;


If we assume the average S&amp;P 500 index returns of 10% (we’ll ignore the $72 annually in expenses and of course there are no taxes), we would see $29k compounded over 5 years = $47,809. Since we’re investing the money all immediately, this is (I believe) more or less equivalent to the IRR rate. 


&amp;nbsp;


So, what do we need to achieve to beat that return with our investment property? Well, we previously assumed a blistering 5% real home price appreciation. With inflation at ~2%, that’s a nominal 7% home price appreciation. According to both Zillow and Core logic, Idaho is the state with the fastest home appreciation values pre-COVID at ~9%. We’re essentially predicting close to this level for 5 years, which is quite rare. In August 2019, US home prices nationally were gaining ~2.6% according to (41).

Let’s plug those numbers into our rental property calculator from above. At a 10% down payment, 3.5% interest rate, and 2.6% home price appreciation we see an IRR of 18% per year. Game, set, match, real estate, right?


&amp;nbsp;


Well, sort of. Right now we are assuming optimistic projections about maintenance (1%), closing costs (2%), and selling costs (4%). What if we bump those up to the averages cited by Zillow (3% and 8%)? Uh-oh, now we’re down to 12.38%. Okay, but what if we assume rent goes up by the same amount, ~2%? Great! Now we’re back up to 14% IRR. But if we assume all the other expenses like home insurance and maintenance go up 2% a year as well, we’re back down to 11%. 


&amp;nbsp;



We could go on forever, but the point is that real estate (particularly for rental properties) are extremely sensitive to assumptions you make on a number of factors. Given the risk, illiquidity, and work involved with a real estate property I would want to see a substantially higher return than the tax advantaged, hands off 10% my 401k gives me. I didn’t even include the typical 3% match for the 401k, which would have added $2100 to the initial investment amount and increased the 5 year return to $51,272.


&amp;nbsp;



The bottom line in my mind is that for most W2 workers who have access to pre-tax investments, they should max them out first. If you’re lucky enough to be able to max out all of the above pre-tax accounts + get a 3% match (i.e. $31k total) every year, after 15 years at a 10% return you’ll have $1.2 million. In 30 years you’ll have $6.8 million. And again, keep in mind that maxing out your pre-tax accounts only “costs” you ~$20k, because that’s what you would get after taxes. And you’ll have “made” those millions without spending a single hour outside of your day job working. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Based on the above analysis and calculations, here’s what I’ve come away with as a newbie to real estate investing:**


* Real estate investing involves significant risk. Achieving high returns relies upon either significant home appreciation or accurately calculating several key inputs (rental rates, maintenance costs, etc.). The past decades strong home appreciation has likely saved some investors from faulty assumptions, simply because their highly leveraged investment increased in value
* Given the significant transaction, maintenance, tax, and other costs simply buying and living in a single family home is not guaranteed to build substantial wealth in the short term (i.e. &lt; 10 years) even with significant price appreciation. 
* The story of real estate investing is really the story of credit availability. Low interest rates, widespread credit, etc. allow investors to take on significant leverage and potentially achieve high returns. On the flip side, if credit tightens we could see substantial movements in real estate as valuations adjust to the more expensive or less available leverage 
* Personally, I would want to see at least 12+% returns annually before I invested in real estate directly vs. a diversified stock portfolio. Potentially having a cash flow negative, illiquid, highly leveraged asset is a risk that I want to be compensated for by a higher return. Obviously there are many advantages to real estate I’ve not yet learned in depth about (e.g. taxes), so perhaps this premium will change slightly in my mind in the future
* If you’re a younger, W2 wage earning in the US with the access and ability to contribute to a 401k, IRA, and HSA you should do that first before even considering real estate investing. The tax advantages are immense, the time investment is essentially nothing, and historically you are guaranteed, at the absolute worst, a 6.5% annualized return if you wait for 35 years. Plus a well diversified 401k fund, like a Vanguard target retirement fund, may very well include REITs
* The exception here of course is doing something like house hacking, etc. where you are combining your primary residence with an investment. I’m not sophisticated enough yet to run the numbers there, but it seems reasonable on the surface 


&amp;nbsp;


**Some thoughts on the future:**

Forecasting is always risky, but at the same time we all have to form an opinion on where the future is headed. My general thoughts are that crisis tend to accelerate existing trends rather than create new ones. There were already recession concerns in late 2019, and US GDP growth expectations had been downgraded to ~2.0% by the OECD even before COVID (45), albeit with slight optimism around the Phase 1 trade deal with China.  Geopolitical tension and capital controls in China had led to mainland Chinese investors slowing their investments in US real estate and increasing dispositions (47). 

* While there is certainly a housing shortage, even in high growth states we see housing “deficits” according to Fannie Mae of ~5%. While this is clearly substantial, shifting migration patterns, regulatory changes, household preferences (e.g. telecommuting) could easily shift the balance. It’s far from certain in my mind that housing will remain supply constrained in the medium term (i.e. &gt; 3 years) 
* In December 2019, Zillow was already forecasting slowing home price and rental appreciation to modest 2.8% &amp; 2.3% respectively (42) 
* As of March 31 2020, Zillow now forecasts home price appreciation at -1.5% nationally. 
* We are seeing tightening mortgage credit, particularly for jumbo loans that are essentially for high priced real estate markets (44). Mortgage services, i.e. non-bank companies like Quicken, have been hit hard by the mortgage forbearance regulations (although relief measures have been enacted) 
* The CBO is currently forecasting the unemployment rate to remain &gt;10% until 2021 (48). Even if that proves wildly pessimistic, it’s highly probably that the tepid wage gains of the last few years will slow further or even reverse 
* Ultimately with  slowing wage gains and reduced credit in the short term it is hard to see how consumers retain their purchasing power to drive rents / real estate prices substantially higher. 
* On the flip side, central banks globally have injected trillions of dollars of liquidity into the global economy. This has driven down yields in traditional safe havens, e.g. investment grade corporate and sovereign bonds. The question becomes, where does this money go? Does it favor real estate over stocks? Does it lead to inflation, deflation, stagflation? 
* Local &amp; state governments are facing massive budget shortfalls due to dramatically lower revenues (e.g. sales taxes) and higher costs (unemployment insurance, healthcare, etc.). If the federal government does not backstop these revenues, will we see higher state / local taxes or cutbacks in services? 
* As mentioned previously, the tax law changes of 2017 dramatically affected how individuals / households approach their federal taxes. In particular, it is now far less advantageous to itemize property taxes, state taxes, mortgage interest, etc. Mark Zandi (50) of Moody’s analytics provided some interesting analysis that suggested the tax law changes had already impacted higher cost markets. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue, accelerate, or reverse post COVID. 
* The question now becomes how investors, particularly those who entered late in the cycle and lack substantial equity buffers, will deal with conditions. A V shaped recovery would likely see minimal disruption as investors are able to cope with disrupted cash flows for several months. A longer recession would see over-leveraged investors forced to short-sell properties 
* I’m particularly struck by the fact that according to at least one source (27) ~72% of first time home buyers put down 6% or less. These recent buyers lack the equity buffer to deal with any material decline in housing prices, while the modest down payment suggests they may also lack substantial cash reserves to deal with an economic shock. 
* There also seems to me a disconnect between commercial and residential real estate I don’t fully understand. Take a well capitalized and diversified REIT like Brookfield Property Partners. This REIT is currently offering a 14%+ yield. Of course many of their properties like urban office / retail space are getting hammered by COVID. But if we’re assuming that centrally located, urban commercial office &amp; retail spaces are substantially less valuable than pre-COVID, what does that say more broadly about dense urban real estate? After all, if people work from home and don’t go out to commercial real estate spaces, why bother paying a premium in living expenses? 

From my point of view, I’m interested in seeing how the market reacts over the next 3-6 months. Do sellers react by rapidly putting properties on the market before it’s “too late”? Are there enough prime  buyers given the tightening credit, particularly for expensive coastal markets, to absorb a spike in listings? As Warren Buffett once said: “""At rare and unpredictable intervals...credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation--usually win, occasionally die--may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company's upside but does not share in its downside.” We shall see.

t3_g950vc,investing,The textbook disconnect and how it may affect the market.,"Just some obervations I have. Open for discussion.

In the past we learnt that bonds and stocks usually moves in opposite direction. However over the past few years, companies issued more bonds to garner cash, and that cash was used to purchase their own stocks. Boeing is one such company. The whole operation started slowing down in january.

Why I think a V shape recovery is unlikely. The stock movements for the past few years were fueled by stock buy backs, often with issuance of corporate bonds. What we’ve read from company earnings now, is that companies started to conserve cash, some scrapped dividends and reduced buy backs. The junk bond market swelled and all desperate to look for buyers. Yes the feds are printing money, whether it is enough to save all will be another question. This rise is fueled by FOMO and speculation.

I believe some stocks will stand to benefit from this lock down. Such as amazon and costco etc. More sales going online is not equal to more sales online. I’ve been tracking big ticket items and electronics on amazon, majority are buying necessities and not luxury items. So the upcoming reports will be interesting to see whether this theory holds up.

My 2 cents.

TLDR: With every other company hoarding up cash for the unknown ahead, stock buy backs will be greatly reduced. Hence no V shape recovery.","The textbook disconnect and how it may affect the market.Just some obervations I have. Open for discussion.

What we’ve read from company earnings now, is that companies started to conserve cash, some scrapped dividends and reduced buy backs. The junk bond market swelled and all desperate to look for buyers. Yes the feds are printing money, whether it is enough to save all will be another question. This rise is fueled by FOMO and speculation.

I believe some stocks will stand to benefit from this lock down. Such as amazon and costco etc. More sales going online is not equal to more sales online. I’ve been tracking big ticket items and electronics on amazon, majority are buying necessities and not luxury items. So the upcoming reports will be interesting to see whether this theory holds up.

My 2 cents.

TLDR: With every other company hoarding up cash for the unknown ahead, stock buy backs will be greatly reduced. Hence no V shape recovery.",0,textbook may affect market obervations open past learnt stock usually move opposite however past year company garner cash cash purchase stock boeing one company whole operation slowing january v shape recovery unlikely stock movement past year stock buy back often issuance corporate company earnings company conserve cash buy back junk market look buyer yes printing money whether enough save another question rise fomo speculation believe stock benefit lock amazon costco etc sale online equal sale online tracking big ticket item electronics amazon majority buying necessity luxury item upcoming report interesting whether theory cent tldr every company cash unknown stock buy back greatly hence v shape recovery

t3_g93g5j,investing,Is there a trailing effect time bomb that's going to kill retail CRE over the next 6-18 months?,"Commercial real estate is generally valued using a cap rate on net operating income. Deals are financed over 5-7 years with a much longer amortization period. Some loans are interest only, but even those that aren't are very interest heavy, thanks to amortization. The average cap rate in CRE for retail  the past few years has been quite low (\~5%).

We're now at the point where a massive number of retail businesses have been closed for 30-60 days, with a large number of those businesses likely paying no rent at all or a discounted rate. It seems likely that a large swath of those businesses will fail, unfortunately. It also seems likely that even when things re-open, you'll have (1) Consumers who are wary of public places like restaurants, etc (especially  older people, who also have more disposable cash) and (2) people who can't afford to shop or eat out as often because they haven't been working for 2 months.

All of the above means an unavoidable drop in NOI and therefore value, that's going to force some owners to pay out of pocket to cover the loss when they refinance, at which time we can assume some owners will just walk away (especially those with vacancies due to businesses failing). This will have a cascading affect that'll push cap rates up, driving values even lower across the sector. 

Just a thought: I'm going to see if there are any REIT ETFs that may be exposed and see what puts are doing.","Is there a trailing effect time bomb that's going to kill retail CRE over the next 6-18 months?Commercial real estate is generally valued using a cap rate on net operating income.

t3_g928u3,investing,What do you think of my modification of Ray Dalio's All-Weather Portfolio?,"Dalio's public All-Weather portfolio is 30% stocks, 40% long term treasuries, 15% intermediate term treasuries, 7.5% gold, 7.5% commodities. If implemented suing ETFs, conventional wisdom would implement it like this:

30% VFINX, 40% VUSTX, 15% VFITX, 15% GLD (for lack of a way to get commodity exposure, I just doubled up on the gold allocation). Starting in Feb 2008, according to [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com), this portfolio yielded about 7.3% CAGR, and had a standard deviation of about 7.3%, and a maximum drawdown of 12.8% in 2008. Assume yearly rebalancing.

Here's my improvement and my reason why: IF we can find an even more volatile bond fund, we could increase the allocation of equity &amp; equity-like assets. There are two such funds out there: EDV and ZROZ. Both of these are extended duration, which means more price volatility &amp; interest rate risk. Because these funds zig when equities zag, we can increase the amount of equity-like exposure in our portfolio.

Instead of adding stocks, I will add leveraged middle market debt instead, specifically Business Development Companies (BDCs). These are essentially banks that solely lend to middle-market companies. Middle market debt has the characteristics of junk bonds - high yield, but equity-like risk. Because the bulk of the returns are paid out in the form of dividends and NOT share appreciation, BDCs can provide a consistent equity-like return. The best managed BDCs are MAIN and ARCC.

So, here's my modified All-Weather portolfio:

40% EDV, 30% VUSTX (stocks), 10% MAIN, 10% ARCC, and 10% gold. According to [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com), starting in Feb 2008, this portfolio yielded about 11.9% CAGR, had a standard deviation of about 11.2%, and had a maximum drawdown of 17.7% in 2008.

In performance, my modified All-Weather portfolio behaves a lot like the original All-Weather portfolio, but leveraged up to a 50% debt/equity ratio, but without using any leverage at all - hence it's suitable for retirement account portfolios. I'm 28, and I'm seriously considering committing this asset allocation for ever inside my 401K and Roth IRA - it's got a nice balance return &amp; volatility.

t3_g91dlv,investing,"HCQ harmful, Remdesevir unhelpful, a quick review of the next steps for COVID-19.","  So last (and shortest) update on Convalescent Plasma in Covid-19, please look through my previous posts about prior discussions on the treatments in Sars-Cov2/COVID-19 and why I predicted HCQ to be harmful/unhelpful and why I wasn't excited on Remdesevir or other antivirals as a class of medicine. 

With the recent not great hint of results on remdesivir, this makes me more bullish on my previously discussed treatment options. At this point, as I pointed out about a month ago, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be largely unhelpful in changing mortality/possibly harmful (our ICU has largely stopped giving it as well) and now remdesivir which had a slightly higher chance of showing clinical effectiveness is likely not helpful. Both of these medications come with risks limiting their use. 

Conversely there are much less side effects/risks to convalescent plasma.  Our main therapies outside of supportive care so far have not been effective against COVID-19 (which I unfortunately expected and outlined in previous posts). 

The last treatment option with previously demonstrated results would be convalescent plasma. As a quick primer, we take the blood/plasma of people that have already made antibodies that kill COVID-19, isolate those antibodies and inject it into people that are suffering from COVID-19. This is what a vaccine aims to do but we’re shortcutting the vaccine production, testing and the bodies response and just giving the antibodies directly. 

Plasma has been used and shown effective in almost every viral disease but is limited by collection; finding a subset of patients with proper antibodies, and getting them to donate plasma. 

As a big disclaimer: This would technically still not be a proven treatment because we’re dealing with a new virus but in my mind it’s about as proven (theoretically, mechanistically and notably on prior models of disease) as you can get in medicine this early on (Prior to large RCTs).

**Convalescent Plasma during the outbreak**: Previously limited by collection during the initial parts of the pandemic (due to small amount of patient with the virus and the logistics involved) plasma will soon flourish and become the standard for severe/life threatening patients with COVID-19. As an immunomodulatory agent I believe it will show mortality benefit given improvement in cytokine storm effects all while also directly decreasing COVID-19 antibodies. 

Logistics surrounding its collection have been fine tuned in the recent weeks through vitalant and the red cross. And initial studies on effectiveness will be released soon that I expect will have th ebest results so far in comparison to other studies. This will likely mirror effectiveness versus previous similar virus’s noted in my previous discussion (Decreased mortality and got people off vents quicker in SARS1, MERS, H1N1). At the time, widespread use against those other viruses was limited by small infected population size and other options being available. An issue we thankfully(?) don’t seem to have with COVID-19. (You need like 4-10 people to make a bag of plasma, so you need 4-10 people that have cleared the virus and are willing to donate to be able to treat one patient.) 

As antibody tests role out to define who is immune, plasma collection agencies role out marketing to collect plasma (and pay people a few hundred bucks, people that are out of a job otherwise), as initial ‘verification’ level research starts to trickle in, and as we run out of other options… this makes an amazing opportunity in the convalescent plasma marketplace as previously defined. 

Counter to that, you get the stability of buying into a market with a predefined CAGR of \~7%. Plasma/IVIG is a drug in that has and will continue to be used for a long time.  It treats diseases that people can’t avoid treatment for, have no cure, and need repeat treatments. (stable baseline market requiring at least 1-2 years of infusions and sometimes lifelong infusions. 

Stable market limiting downside. COVID-19 treatment with massive upside. 

The only derailing instrument to this would be a vaccine at this point, which is 6 month – multiple years out. (As previously discussed, the heterogeneity of the cell surface proteins in COVID-19 make it harder than usual to make a vaccine against… and we’ve never made a vaccine against a coronavirus subclass before… all that to say, the vaccine is likely a while away and the first few will almost invariably fail to show clinical effectiveness as all vaccine production processess usually do unfortunately.

Many of these companies have already started to spike in price and are close to returning to pre-COVID valuations but I believe the roof on them is still very high.

t3_g8tas7,investing,DraftKings (DKNG) is a BUY at $20 - Well Positioned for U.S. Market Leadership and Weathering the COVID-19 Crisis.,"CORRECTION: DKNG IS A SMALL POSITION BUY AND WATCH

Due to the nature of the reverse merger IPO, we did a data check on our automated market cap pull, which actually turned out to be &gt;$3.3B. Because of this, the P/S ratio is now &gt;8.2, meaning is priced high compared to its competitors. However, there is a lot of positive sentiment, as we outlined, for DKNG which could drive its stock price higher as people price in future value. We are going to take a small position at market open and continue to watch DKNG closely and dollar cost average over time. Apologies for any confusion our initial post may have caused. The reverse merger IPO is not common and therefore a lot of databases do not accurately reflect the actual market cap for DKNG right now. Buying at $10 per share is more reasonable.

\---

While we primarily focus on biotech, we are opportunistic investors and love to invest in high-growth startups that are revolutionizing their industries. DraftKings (DKNG) is a high-growth startup that recently IPO'd through a reverse merger last Friday and saw a 10% increase in value on their first day of trading, ending the day with a market cap of $950M. DKNG's IPO amid the pause of sports during the COVID-19 crisis has some people scratching their heads, but after conducting an opportunity assessment and financial diligence on DKNG, we believe it is a BUY and is well positioned to continue leading online sports betting and also breaking into the online casino space.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why we think DKNG is well positioned as a growth stock:

&amp;#x200B;

1. DKNG is in close competition with FanDuel for market leadership in U.S. sports betting. When consumers were asked to list companies offering daily fantasy sports and sportsbetting, DKNG was top of mind for a quarter of interviewees while it was the preferred brand for almost a third of consumers. We personally conducted several consumer interviews on their preferred daily fantasy sports and sports betting companies and DKNG ranked top, with consumers citing the platform as more ""user-friendly."" Furthermore, consumers cited more attractive promotions with better odds offered by DKNG than FanDuel in order to drive user adoption and retention. In a competitive space like this, it's promising that DKNG is focused on customer acquisition and retention.

&amp;#x200B;

2. DKNG is quick to penetrate markets upon online sports betting legalization. DKNG has a track record of moving quick to acquire customers when states legalize online sports betting. For example, DKNG moved quick to win the exclusive bid in New Hampshire and quickly turned online in Pennsylvania when legalization occurred. While DKNG is surely no longer a startup, their talented and driven team is versatile and quick to address make-or-break situations that allow them to take market share quickly. With so many states on the cusp of legalizing online sports betting, it's easy to see upside and growth potential in online sports betting. DKNG is well positioned to take a significant share of that growing market.

&amp;#x200B;

3. DKNG's diverse set of offerings allow them to weather the sports shutdown caused by COVID-19. While DKNG is known for daily fantasy sports and sports betting, it's diversified greatly into e-sports (e.g., League of Legends, Counter-Strike) and online casino (e.g., Blackjack). In the month of March, internet gaming revenue (excluding sports wagers) in New Jersey rose 66% in March, to $65 million. Clearly, while sports are out of commission, DKNG will benefit from the rise in online gambling and the continued interest in e-sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

4. DKNG is positioned to expand the online casino industry by making online gambling mainstream. Daily fantasy sports and online sports betting is arguably much more mainstream than online casino gambling. Consumers perceive fantasy sports and sports betting to be a skill and information-based game while online casino gambling as sheer luck. DKNG is positioned to link the two together by bringing consumers onto the platform through daily fantasy sports and sports betting and having them dip their toes in the online casino through promos. The adjacency of its sports betting and online casino offerings creates a powerful pipeline that has the opportunity to make online casino gambling more mainstream and DKNG may be at the forefront of it.

&amp;#x200B;

5. The reverse merger provided $500M in cash to DKNG, which will help DKNG through the COVID-19 crisis. In the reverse merger, DKNG has access to $500M in cash, which is enough to cover its average operating costs for approximately 2.5 years. There may be headcount cuts to look out for as they've hired significantly in the past two years and their general &amp; administrative costs has increased almost 100% since last year. However, DKNG's  increased cash position with the reverse merger will definitely help it weather through the suspension in sports.

&amp;#x200B;

6. At $20 per share, DKNG is fairly priced compared to its competitors based on its price-to-sales ratio (P/S). DKNG has a P/S of 2.9 compared to Stars Group, FanDuel, and Churchill Downs, which have P/S ratios of 4.1, 3.7, and 2.6 respectively. DKNG is more similar to Stars group and FanDuel given they have more of an online presence and higher growth potential. Churchill Downs on the other hand owns several horse racing tracks and is less poised for growth and therefore has a lower P/S ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, we perceive DKNG as a buy. It's currently a leader in the space and is well positioned to maintain leadership in the U.S. market with its fast-moving team and diverse offering of games. While COVID-19-driven suspension of sports is concerning, the company has money on hand from the reverse merger IPO and has several revenue streams that are not impacted by the suspension of sports. As long as states continue to lift online sports betting and gambling restrictions, DKNG will be waiting to charge into the new markets.","DraftKings (DKNG) is a BUY at $20 - Well Positioned for U.S. Market Leadership and Weathering the COVID-19 Crisis.CORRECTION: DKNG IS A SMALL POSITION BUY AND WATCH

DKNG's IPO amid the pause of sports during the COVID-19 crisis has some people scratching their heads, but after conducting an opportunity assessment and financial diligence on DKNG, we believe it is a BUY and is well positioned to continue leading online sports betting and also breaking into the online casino space.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why we think DKNG is well positioned as a growth stock:

&amp;#x200B;

1. DKNG is in close competition with FanDuel for market leadership in U.S. sports betting. When consumers were asked to list companies offering daily fantasy sports and sportsbetting, DKNG was top of mind for a quarter of interviewees while it was the preferred brand for almost a third of consumers. We personally conducted several consumer interviews on their preferred daily fantasy sports and sports betting companies and DKNG ranked top, with consumers citing the platform as more ""user-friendly."" Furthermore, consumers cited more attractive promotions with better odds offered by DKNG than FanDuel in order to drive user adoption and retention. In a competitive space like this, it's promising that DKNG is focused on customer acquisition and retention.

&amp;#x200B;

2. DKNG is quick to penetrate markets upon online sports betting legalization. DKNG has a track record of moving quick to acquire customers when states legalize online sports betting. For example, DKNG moved quick to win the exclusive bid in New Hampshire and quickly turned online in Pennsylvania when legalization occurred. While DKNG is surely no longer a startup, their talented and driven team is versatile and quick to address make-or-break situations that allow them to take market share quickly. With so many states on the cusp of legalizing online sports betting, it's easy to see upside and growth potential in online sports betting. DKNG is well positioned to take a significant share of that growing market.

&amp;#x200B;

3. DKNG's diverse set of offerings allow them to weather the sports shutdown caused by COVID-19. While DKNG is known for daily fantasy sports and sports betting, it's diversified greatly into e-sports (e.g., League of Legends, Counter-Strike) and online casino (e.g., Blackjack). In the month of March, internet gaming revenue (excluding sports wagers) in New Jersey rose 66% in March, to $65 million. Clearly, while sports are out of commission, DKNG will benefit from the rise in online gambling and the continued interest in e-sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

4. DKNG is positioned to expand the online casino industry by making online gambling mainstream. Daily fantasy sports and online sports betting is arguably much more mainstream than online casino gambling. Consumers perceive fantasy sports and sports betting to be a skill and information-based game while online casino gambling as sheer luck. DKNG is positioned to link the two together by bringing consumers onto the platform through daily fantasy sports and sports betting and having them dip their toes in the online casino through promos. The adjacency of its sports betting and online casino offerings creates a powerful pipeline that has the opportunity to make online casino gambling more mainstream and DKNG may be at the forefront of it.

&amp;#x200B;

5. The reverse merger provided $500M in cash to DKNG, which will help DKNG through the COVID-19 crisis. In the reverse merger, DKNG has access to $500M in cash, which is enough to cover its average operating costs for approximately 2.5 years. There may be headcount cuts to look out for as they've hired significantly in the past two years and their general &amp; administrative costs has increased almost 100% since last year. However, DKNG's  increased cash position with the reverse merger will definitely help it weather through the suspension in sports.

&amp;#x200B;

6. At $20 per share, DKNG is fairly priced compared to its competitors based on its price-to-sales ratio (P/S). DKNG has a P/S of 2.9 compared to Stars Group, FanDuel, and Churchill Downs, which have P/S ratios of 4.1, 3.7, and 2.6 respectively. DKNG is more similar to Stars group and FanDuel given they have more of an online presence and higher growth potential. Churchill Downs on the other hand owns several horse racing tracks and is less poised for growth and therefore has a lower P/S ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, we perceive DKNG as a buy. It's currently a leader in the space and is well positioned to maintain leadership in the U.S. market with its fast-moving team and diverse offering of games. While COVID-19-driven suspension of sports is concerning, the company has money on hand from the reverse merger IPO and has several revenue streams that are not impacted by the suspension of sports. As long as states continue to lift online sports betting and gambling restrictions, DKNG will be waiting to charge into the new markets.",0,draftkings dkng buy well u market weathering covid crisis correction dkng small position buy watch due nature reverse merger ipo check market cap pull actually b p ratio meaning high competitor however lot positive sentiment dkng stock price higher people price future value small position market open continue watch dkng closely cost average time apology confusion initial post may reverse merger ipo common therefore lot accurately reflect actual market cap dkng right buying per share reasonable primarily focus biotech opportunistic investor love invest high growth startup revolutionizing draftkings dkng high growth startup recently ipo reverse merger last saw increase value first market cap dkng ipo pause sport covid crisis people scratching opportunity assessment financial dkng believe buy well continue online sport betting breaking online casino space xb dkng well growth stock xb dkng close competition fanduel market u sport betting consumer list company offering fantasy sport sportsbetting dkng top quarter interviewee almost consumer personally several consumer interview fantasy sport sport betting company dkng top consumer citing platform user furthermore consumer attractive promotion better dkng fanduel user retention competitive space promising dkng customer acquisition retention xb dkng quick penetrate market upon online sport betting legalization dkng track moving quick acquire customer state legalize online sport betting example dkng quick win exclusive new hampshire quickly online pennsylvania legalization dkng surely longer startup team versatile quick break situation allow market share quickly many state cusp legalizing online sport betting easy growth potential online sport betting dkng well significant share growing market xb dkng set offering allow weather sport covid dkng known fantasy sport sport betting greatly e sport e g league counter strike online casino e g blackjack month march internet gaming revenue sport wager new jersey rose march million clearly sport commission dkng benefit rise online gambling interest e sport betting xb dkng online casino making online gambling mainstream daily fantasy sport online sport betting arguably much mainstream online casino gambling consumer perceive fantasy sport sport betting skill information game online casino gambling sheer luck dkng link two together bringing consumer onto platform fantasy sport sport betting toe online casino promos sport betting online casino offering creates powerful pipeline opportunity online casino gambling mainstream dkng may forefront xb reverse merger cash dkng help dkng covid crisis reverse merger dkng access cash enough cover average operating cost approximately year may cut look significantly past two year general cost almost since last year however dkng cash position reverse merger help weather suspension sport xb per share dkng fairly competitor price sale ratio p dkng p star group fanduel churchill down p ratio respectively dkng similar star group fanduel given online presence higher growth potential churchill down owns several horse racing track le growth therefore lower p ratio xb overall perceive dkng buy currently space well maintain u market fast moving team offering game covid suspension sport concerning company money reverse merger ipo several revenue stream suspension sport long state continue lift online sport betting gambling restriction dkng waiting charge new market

t3_g8t14p,investing,Why markets rise on unemployment,"It's all about cash flows. Your stock is equity in a company, and when there's a demand shock, your employees are a net expense that reduce cashflows. When there's a lack of supply, employees are net positive because they produce goods and services that the company can sell for more later -&gt; hire to meet demand.

Layoffs and unemployment increase net cashflows in companies during times like this. This has been seen in past recessions when stocks would rise when a company announces layoffs.

Remember, the economy and the stock market are not the same thing. What serves the shareholder's interests is not always what serves the economy's interests; e.g. laying off Sears employees to strip the company's assets and make a profit -&gt; negative for the economy, positive for shareholders. As investors, you invest cash to generate more cash: paying employees to do nothing is counterproductive.

t3_g8sg07,investing,Thoughts on XLE 2022 leap call strategy?,"So, I've been messing around with options for a little bit, and I'm interested in using them now to make a serious, longer-term investment.

I'm looking at putting a lot of my portfolio into buying 2022 LEAP calls on XLE. My thesis is that the US energy sector is currently very oversold due to the virus/oil crash, but will recover much of its value in the next 1-3 years.

My plan is to purchase OTM calls and roll them forward periodically until my price target is met. At that point, I will close my positions and switch to a different investment.

I'm very skeptical of the ""V-shaped recovery,"" and I expect demand for energy to be suppressed over the next couple years, so I'm aiming at a target below the last decade's average. I'm looking for around ~$55/share, versus XLE's current price of ~$35. 

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this strategy. I have several questions.

Most importantly,

* Do you agree with my thesis? How convincing is the counter-argument?

I'd also welcome suggestions on several technical points:

* How far OTM should I buy? Is it mathematically better to do this in a single far-OTM purchase, or should I do it in smaller steps, periodically closing positions and buying new ones at higher strikes?

* How frequently should I roll the contracts forward? Are there certain conditions I should look for (e.g. doing so during a low-volatility period)?

* I expect volatility to revert toward its historical mean over the next 2 years. Should I hedge against this by buying puts on some VIX derivative? Or should that money just go toward more XLE calls? (If hedging, how do I scale the hedge, and why aren't I better off just putting volatility in the first place if it's that important?)

* I'm planning to buy most of this position on Friday, after XOM/CVX earnings, in hopes of entering on a relatively low-volatility day (and maybe a lower entry point if earnings are a bloodbath). Reasonable?

Thanks for any advice you folks have to offer!","Thoughts on XLE 2022 leap call strategy?So, I've been messing around with options for a little bit, and I'm interested in using them now to make a serious, longer-term investment.

t3_g8mul5,investing,The most optimal ETF stock/bond portfolio,"I've been learning a whole lot about ETFs lately, so I made what I consider to be a very profitable portfolio set up. Here is the thought process:

I made sure to allocate 10% to bonds as a hedge against market crashes, and also kept 15-20% in international stocks to remain geographically diversified. I also weighted my portfolio towards smaller cap and value stocks as historically they are more profitable compared to large-cap and growth stocks.  I have two slightly different versions, but the one I'm using only has about 10% in large-cap us stocks (half s&amp;p 500 half QQQ) while a whopping 60% is in small-cap and small-cap value stocks. I also included a low-carbon target ETF position as I believe the importance and value of companies that do not rely upon fossil fuels rather than renewable energy are vastly underrated. I understand that this portfolio is much more volatile and high beta compared to safer blue-chip ETFs and portfolios with larger bond positions, but I prefer a more aggressive approach as I am still very young and long term this is likely to be much more profitable. When I get older I will likely begin allocating more of my portfolio to bonds.

t3_g8mmp6,investing,Break Even Point of Value Investing,"I've become interested in investing and specifically value investing a la Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Benjamin Graham, etc. However, I'm also a Project Manager and we often analyze business cases for new projects against one another and against our internal rate of return.

I was wondering if anyone has done something similar? This is a 100% mental masturbation exercise but I'm hoping people here can refine my thinking: 

My thought process and questions: 

1. Long term, based on past performance, I can reasonably expect a return of about 6% just investing in index funds (I don't have source but I hear about this number often). So the ""project"" of value investing has to have an equally reasonable expectation that I will get much more than 6% because my time is valuable.

2. Assuming learning and analyzing companies are something I like to do how many hours per year would be required for me to return more than 6%? Of course I could spend 1 hour and get lucky but how many hours would be required to be 90% confident my return would be between 10-20%? 
3. If I value my time at $50/hour how much does it ""cost"" me to get more than 6% return? 
4. What happens if you have a hard cap on the hours you can spend analyzing companies? Is there a minimum number of hours required for it to become worth while?

t3_g8kxtt,investing,Moving from VTI to VTSAX- does timing matter?,"Hello,

I have been toying with the idea of moving my VTI to VTSAX because I can set up automatic investments in VTSAX, which would allow me to be a less emotional investor than I currently am while I watch VTI and try to ""time"" when to go in. 

I understand that VTSAX needs $3000 buy in and I have heard that people switch their VTI to VTSAX rather than buying a new $3000 of VTSAX to buy in. My question is- Is it okay to do this whenever or are there times when transfering from VTI to VTSAX would be better than others? If there are, how can I best determine when that would be? Should I wait for the market to recover?

&gt; In Russia, one of the world’s top producers, the industry is considering resorting to burning its oil to take it off the market, sources told Reuters. 

&gt; U.S. billionaire Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources Inc sent servicers out into fields in Oklahoma and North Dakota in the middle of the week to abruptly shut wells, and the company declared it could not make crude deliveries to customers due to poor economics.

&gt; Continental’s decision to declare force majeure - usually reserved for wars, accidents or natural disasters - came as a shock, bringing a sharp response from the leading refinery industry group. But some say there is a logic behind it, even if it may not pass muster in court.

&gt; “You sign contracts based on the average norms that a society has experienced over the last 100 years. If we have a new event that is not covered by those norms, it goes into force majeure. That’s what Harold Hamm and others are saying - that these are circumstances outside the norm,” said Anas Alhajji, an energy market expert based in Dallas. 

&gt; Azerbaijan, part of the group of nations known as OPEC+, is forcing a BP-led group to cut output for the first time ever. Oil majors in those countries have generally been excluded from government-imposed cuts.

&gt; “We have never done it before since they came to the country in 1994 and signed the contract of the century,” a senior Azeri official told Reuters. 

&gt; That accommodation can no longer be made with the world running out of space to put oil. As of Thursday, energy researcher Kpler said onshore storage worldwide is now roughly 85% full. 

&gt; “I’m sure hearing the same numbers about demand destruction of 20 to 30 million barrels a day,” said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy, who was working at the New York Mercantile Exchange when U.S. crude futures were launched in 1983. “Until we see some kind of alleviation of that, you have to wonder what is in store.”","Reuters: Russia is considering resorting to burning its oil to take it off the market, Continental Resources Inc abruptly shutting wells in Oklahoma and North Dakotahttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-turmoil/when-oil-became-waste-a-week-of-turmoil-for-crude-and-more-pain-to-come-idUSKCN228059

t3_g8iycl,investing,Some of my personal investment habits. Totally Arbitrary. Maybe Stupid.,"Been investing myself for a little over three years. Have been posting replies in r/investing for a while and figure it may be time for me to share some of my own investment habits. Again, not scientific, not pro, totally arbitrary, maybe full of stupidity, as I am NOT a financial/econ/investment/business professional.

\-I believe investment starts with budgeting. I made a monthly budget and calculated how much money I have left after usual expenditure and putting away emergency savings. Then I invest 60%-70% of my remaining money; the rest I put into high-yield savings account or let it sit for several months and open a CD somdwhere.

\-I just have a.....paranoid obsession with diversification. After three years of playing with the market I now own a portfolio of more than 15 stocks, a couple REITS, 15+ ETFs (including one gold ETF) and four mutual funds. Many of these I have only say 0.5-1K of money invested in. I am just convinced that going into diversification helps disperse and mitigate risk. My gold ETF has made up for some of the losses in the current market downturn, but with everything turned to shit I am not better off than anybody else. I also use ETFs to gain exposure to foreign markets I cannot directly buy into. The same obsession applies to bank accounts: I have accounts in several banks to spread my savings.

\-When I first started buying stocks, I used to find the portfolio of a specific ETF in a specific sector that I have a positive view on, find their top 5-10 holdings of stocks, check their dividend info, and buy the one with highest dividend yield. Kinda like letting the ""smarter"" people do the picking for me while not having to entrust my money with them. (And later I found that the portfolio changes frequently :p)

\-I consider myself a dividend investor and I prefer stocks with high dividend yield. But I also want to reap profit from time to time. I made myself a rule: if a stock's unrealized upward gain equals 15-20 years of average dividend and I do not plan to hold it long term, I sell it, keep the gains, and then reinvest roughly the same amount of original principals into another stock. This makes me sell a stock or two and then buy one or two every quarter. Kinda stupid thinking backward, but hey I do want to get some fast cash out of my stocks from time to time. I was able to cash out some of my gains at the top of S&amp;P500 last year with this strategy; still I am hit hard by the current turmoil.

\-I buy both physical gold bars/coins and gold ETF. Say what you like or don't like about gold, but people are so accustomed to fleeing into gold amid turmoil, it still is a safe haven asset in the foreseeable future I believe.

\-I don't buy any, ANY stock from Chinese companies listed in the US. I don't even hold an ETF of Chinese stocks and market---I can't control if some of my ETFs/Funds have exposure to Chinese companies, but I just don't buy anything focused on China. One reason is that my family is in China and they already invest inChinese market, but there is also another lesson learned by myself. Having worked part time at a financial website for a year and having translated many documents and interviews of Chinese companies, I just know how much shit these companies put out just to get listed in the US. This is absolutely not rational and I know it. This also makes me miss huge gains of Alibaba, Baidu etc but I am very firm at staying away from Chinese companies. The same principle I think should apply to Hong Kong stock exchange. There are just so many shitty Chinese companies listed there.

\-Yes I do buy actively managed mutual funds. Obsession with diversification is one reason. But I do believe that actively managed funds have a slightly better chance of hedging against risks than passive or index funds/ETFs (not that I don't buy them). Currently, my conservative strategy mutual fund is doing better than my moderate strategy one, recording a positive.

\-I realize that mentality is an important and tricky thing. A lot of investors are not very unsettled by losing money but will regret enormously not being able to reap profit that they believe they ""should have"" gained. I try very hard to escape from this type of mentality. I only seek to beat the inflation with my dividend. I've recorded a steady 3%-4% dividend yield from my portfolio in the past few years (not counting gains from selling stocks) and I am happy with it.

\-I don't have any virtual currency holdings. If only I had the guts to buy some Bitcoin a few years back (compare with the last statement to see irony LOL).

\-Resources that I frequently rely on:

Bloomberg: subscribed for monthly subscription. News source.

[Dividend.com](https://Dividend.com): subscribed for premium to track my dividend stock ratings and yield.

Investopedia: frequent go-to website for knowledge and terms.

[etfdb.com](https://etfdb.com): did not subscribe but I frequently check this website for ETF recommendations and info (limited in free edition). Seems to come from the same team that operates [dividend.com](https://dividend.com).

**Company:** Inspire Medical Systems (INSP)

**Short call by:** Wolfpack Research on 4/23/2020

**Thesis:** Inspire is a medical technology company that makes a surgically implanted device for treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Wolfpack believes the cure is worse than the disease, as 85% of patients have suffered an adverse event, including temporary paralysis and electrical shock. Potential dangers include nerve damage and battery fluid leaking into the body. The scary side effects could be behind the reason why despite being offered for free to 9 million U.S. veterans since 2014, only 387 have elected to have the surgery. Wolfpack believes the total addressable market is overstated by a factor of 50x in Inspire’s marketing copy.

**Company:** Mirati Therapeutics, Inc (MRTX)

**Short call by:** Kerrisdale Capital on 4/23/2020

**Thesis:** Mirati is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company who produces MRTX-849, a drug that is a small-molecule KRAS inhibitor (KRASi). Mirati has released Phase I data showing that their KRASi are capable of shrinking tumors in second-line treatment of patients with KRAS-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer. Taking into account the low response rate of patients and the short duration of responses, Kerrisdale believes the data indicates an extremely low chance of approval. Kerrisdale also points to an influx of new competitors taking differentiated approaches to targeting KRAS, who they believe will be more effective.

**Company:** Akazoo S.A. (SONG)

**Short call by:** Quintessential Capital Management on 4/20/2020

**Thesis:** Akazoo is an online music streaming company (think Spotify). Akazoo’s financials claim sales of $145M and EBIDTA of $10M, but Quintessential believes these numbers are highly inflated. They point out that Akazoo has been burning $4M in cash per year and paying 0 income taxes, despite claiming profits of $22M over the last 4 years. Furthermore, compared to its competitors, Akazoo’s app has a suspiciously low number of reviews relative to the active users claimed by the company. The ratio of users to reviews is 17x higher than any of its peers.

**Company:** New Pacific Metals Corp. (NUPMF)

**Short call by:** Hindenburg Research on 4/20/2020

**Thesis:** New Pacific is a silver mining company focused on projects in the exploration stage. Its projects are primarily centered in Bolivia, but Hindenburg believes that due to an unfavorable political climate New Pacific doesn’t even legally own its assets. Background: New Pacific purchased its mining concessions and was supported by a friendly government. However, this government was overthrown in a coup in 2019, with the president fleeing to Mexico. The new government has accused the previous Minister of Mines of corruption and launched a criminal investigation. The former head of the Bolivian State Mining Corporation (COMIBOL) told Hindenburg “Unless there’s a (comprehensive) framework regulation, I personally don’t think (the New Pacific deal) will get approved by Parliament.”","Weekly Short Ideas Series (4/26/2020)*This is a curated list of the best short ideas published across the web.

Then I thought since FSCS is such a big thing for money protection in bad situations I might as well read my brokers policy. 

Came across this line 
""Client money is entirely segregated from IBUK’s own money. In the event of a failure of an authorised firm, clients’ monies held in the segregated accounts will be returned to the clients rather than being treated as a recoverable asset by general creditors""

Does this mean when a broker goes bust, your shares are no longer assets but cash at its current state?

t3_g8csc6,investing,Crude oil index VS spot prices,"Hi fellow investors,

I came to suprising realisation when I was exploring spot prices of crude oil vs some oil indexes. It seems to me that those indexes fall quicker and rise slower then underlying asset. For example check those 2 charts:

 [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCOMCLTR:IND](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCOMCLTR:IND) 

 [https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) 

from lows in 1/2016 to highs in 6/2018 there is somewhat bigger rise in spot prices of oil in second chart then in that Bloomberg index. In contrast with that from those mentioned highs there is bigger drop in Bloomberg index then in spot price.

I was thinking it may be because index must roll from one contract to another and there can be gains or loses from that. But why in both cases there seem to be loses? For example there is another index which seem to do this even more. Especially on times more then 5 years in the past (which I cant find for Bloomberg index unfortunately)

15% US Medium-term bonds

7.5% Gold Commodity

My Belief is that we grow our portfolio to protect out money from devaluing due to inflation. Therefore, we are making the portfolio to include assets that would appreciate faster than the inflation rate and the Bank's interest rate. Also, lose less than the SPY during downtimes like a recession we are facing today.

t3_g88lsf,investing,Draftkings (DKNG) dramatically overvalued? Sanity check,"As many of you know, Draftkings went public Friday through a reverse merger with DEAC. When announced last November, the deal was valued at $3.3 billion. In order to hold $400 million cash as required by the terms of the deal, DEAC sold stock which was originally priced at $10 per share. The value of those shares rose to \~$17 by market close yesterday driven by people wanting to invest in Draftkings before the deal was finalized. These DEAC shares are being swapped today 1:1 for DKNG shares.

Problem is, DEAC's S1/A (describing the deal - link below) filed with the SEC yesterday described a large increase in the supply of shares of stock available following the merger. On the 2nd page DEAC is listed as having 44.7 million shares of stock and 3 million warrants. In the ""description of securities"" section on page 150 it says the following:

*After giving effect to the Business Combination, New DraftKings will have approximately 313 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding (assuming no redemptions) and approximately 394 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding (assuming no redemptions).*

For the original deal valuation of $3.3 billion be true, the share price with a 313 million share supply should be \~$10 per share, which is exactly what DEAC offered to pay for shares that did not wish to be converted to shares of DKNG at the shareholder meeting yesterday. Today, DKNG stock opened at over $20 per share which indicates a deal value of over $6 billion. How is this possible when it seems existing shares are being diluted 6-1?

At Charles Schwab (and many other brokerages as well), DKNG shares have not yet been provided to sell. On Friday, the orderbook was incredibly thin, but once new shares hit the market large holders have the liquidity they need to dump at an absurd valuation.

Buy all the puts? Someone please tell me why I am wrong?

With stocks and bonds, this makes sense.

While local pressures exist and every housing market is different, it is still worth taking a look at broader trends. Where will house prices be a year from now once the coronavirus is behind us and we begin rebuilding our economy?


**The case for lower prices**

*Decreased demand*

Record unemployment and reduced wages will strip demand for purchases. In order to move real estate prices must come down. 

*Increased supply*

After coronavirus restrictions are lifted the banks will be allowed to proceed with business as usual. With record unemployment and a failure of the economy to bounce back as quickly as hoped, foreclosures will be at 2008 levels or worse. 

We may be able to slow the virus but we can't stop it. Many older and people with health issues will lose their lives which will add supply to the market. 


**The case for higher prices**

*Increased money supply*

The Fed is printing money at unprecedented levels. This puts upward price pressure on all assets. Stocks and real estate. 

*Decreased supply*

In the short term, the lockdown is preventing people from leaving their houses. People don't want strangers in their houses and are reluctant from putting their homes on the market. Less supply pushes prices up. 

New home building has ground to a halt which is putting less supply on the market.

t3_g7yu4g,investing,Calculating projected per share earnings question,"I'm reading this book and am stuck on trying to figure out this one calculation. Please help!

\--

""In 1987 Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pre-tax earnings of $.70 a share; this equates to after-tax earnings of $.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola's earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 10%.

Seeing this, Warren could argue that he had just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that the pretax yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 10% (Coca-Cola's average annual rate of earnings growth for the ten years prior to 1987).

In, in 1987, he had projected out the earnings growth of 10% forward, he could have argued that by 2007 Coca-Cola would have a pretax per share earnings of $4.35 and after-tax earnings of $2.82 a share. This would mean that by 2007 his pretax return on his Coca-Cola equity bonds would grow to 66%, which equates to an after-tax return of 43%.""

t3_g7xwhx,investing,FT article: Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‘monster’ depression,"[https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

While the headline is somewhat exaggerated, the premise is correct. 

**Here the whole article:** The divergence between the flying stock market and the dying economy is so extreme it is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.

The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life under global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected, spurring the IMF this week to forecast the biggest global recession since the 1930s' Great Depression.

Some investors are in awe at the scale of the shock. ""We really are in uncharted territory,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""We have a monster mash-up of the Great Depression in size, the crash of 1987 in speed, and 9-11 attack in terms of fear.""

And yet, stock markets have been on a tear for a month. What was once dismissed as a mere ""bear market rally"" often strong but ultimately doomed bounces that can occur in the middle of severe downturns - has now turned into a 23 per cent jump for global stocks. Technically, that qualifies as a new bull market.

The rise has erased half the stock market fall since late February, and brought the FTSE All-World index back to levels seen in the US tax cut-fuelled summer rally of 2017. Analysts and investors say that global efforts by central banks to soothe the financial system have been the trigger.

Citigroup estimates that the biggest central banks will buy $5tn of bonds this year, led by the US Federal Reserve, which is more than twice the size of the stimulus seen at the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The Fed has even charged into areas once thought untouchable for central banks, announcing plans to support corporate debt graded ""junk"" by credit rating agencies.

Throw in various other liquidity injections and a series of government spending packages aimed at ameliorating the effects of measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the overall stimulus bill comes to $14th, according to the IMF.

""The Fed has been very clear that it will do whatever it takes,"" said Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan. ""The question is whether this will be enough.""

Many investors seem to think so. Technology stocks are once again leading the rally, but even travel and leisure stocks have jumped 24 per cent from the lows, trimming their decline this year to 37 per cent.

Investors appear to be writing off 2020, focusing instead on the prospects for an economic normalisation in 2021, analysts say.

Some of the technical forces that fuelled the sell-off are also helping stoke the comeback. Hedging by banks, trading strategies that automatically buy when volatility simmers down, and thinner liquidity are all now supporting the rally, according to JPMorgan.

History also offers some encouragement to the optimists. Bespoke Investment Group crunched the numbers on every big US stock market slump, and found that once equities had clawed back over half their losses, that had tended to signal that the lows would not be retested.

One notable exception, however, was after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. The US stock market rallied over 44 per cent from the November 1929 low through to March 1930 before sliding another 80 per cent, and did not reclaim its 1929 highs until September 1954.

Some investors think this is a plausible scenario now. Paul Singer, the head of Elliott Management, warned that stocks could easily renew their slide and drop by half from the February peak.

""Despite the massive stimulus moves around the world and the unimaginably large new rounds of money printing, there is substantial uncertainty about the future viability of a large range of businesses,"" Mr Singer wrote, in a recent letter to clients. ""To us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains.""

Some nervousness began to creep back into markets this week, triggered by ructions in the oil market crowned by the unprecedented sight of the benchmark US crude price sliding below zero on Monday. Although partly a technical dislocation, it underscored the fragile state of the global economy.

Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season has started to reveal the extent of the revenue destruction hitting many companies. And such grim results may pale next to what is likely to be a

""horrific"" second quarter, warns Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

The message was hammered home by data released on Thursday showing another 4.4m Americans claiming unemployment benefits, taking the total since mid March to over 26m. A potential antiviral drug for coronavirus failed its first randomised clinical trial, further denting sentiment.

Ms Sonders points out that even if equities do not plunge below the lows of March, economic downturns of this magnitude tend to produce a lot of head-fake rallies and stomach-churning sell-offs.

""Anyone who thinks we're going to keep moving up in a straight line is living in la-la land,"" she warned.

\------------

I guess that's what the majority here feels anyways. Doesn't mean you should not be building clever positions at this moment in a few stocks, but these should be true conviction buys based on good entry price, solid company products with longterm growth potential, neat balance sheet and a capable leadership team. Keep 70% to 80% cash.","FT article: Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‘monster’ depression[https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

I feel like many of these people know deep down inside that we did hit lows already but they’re mad that they missed them so they tell themselves it will hit a new low soon to make themselves feel better.

Whenever you ask them to explain why they think we haven’t hit a low yet, they’ll give an explanation for why the stock market will go down in the future or why the stock market will not recover as fast, which are probably true, but it don’t explain why there would be another sell-off where the DOW goes down 5,000+ points. Yeah the stock market isn’t going to only go up from here, it will go up but also down, that’s just how the stock market works but I’ve yet to see an argument on why it would go down under 18,000 when the economies are starting to open. I think the only reason that would happen is if the virus comes back in the Fall but we’re still multiple months away from that and I can’t see any arguments why there would be another sell off in the next months before that happens as economies start to reopen","We haven’t hit bottom yet?I see a lot of people talking about how they’re not investing yet because they believe we haven’t hit bottom.

t3_g7vock,investing,Betting on industries that have a “monopoly” in the stock market. Taking advantage of dumb money and FOMO.,"I understand there is no such thing as a monopoly in the US but hear me out. 

Last year i saw two companies go public with “decent” valuations that quickly rose to ridiculous market caps once retail investors jumped in. Those companies were the only stock people could buy if they wanted exposure in that industry. I’m talking about Beyond Meat and Virgin Galactic.

Beyond Meat has tons of competition. Impossible burger, Tyson, KHC, whatever, you name it. They will have a very tough time in the next few years.
But they have a “VIRTUAL MONOPOLY” in the stock market, because if people want to invest in “vegan meat” or whatever they make, they are going to buy BYND, because they won’t buy all this other companies that have exposure to fake meat but it’s only a tiny part of their operations. 

This causes “true believers” investors to buy and hold, stock rises FOMO kicks in, people start shorting when ridiculous valuations are reached, big boys know it and push for a short squeeze and you get crazy valuations. BYND from $25 a share IPO to $220 within three months.

The same can be said about Virgin Galatic (SPCE). Yes Boeing has exposure to space, Space X is a thousand miles ahed and the bald guy from amazon has Blue Origin. 

Virgin Galatic was and still is a piece of trash, extremly overvalued company. But if a retail investors wanted exposure to SPACE they could only buy Virgin Galactic. It happened the same with BYND, the stock rose from $7 to $44.

Now i missed those two investment oportunities because i didn’t understand the proces and how can one company with $100M in revenue can be worth 10B.

I don’t want to sit on the sidelines and watch another opportunith go.
Now here is what i think can happen and history repeats itself. Draft Kings went public yesterday  and the investment community was aware of the adquisition company DEAC and how DEAC would be DKNG once the SEC approved lt. 
I believe this company has all the right ingredients to explodd in the coming months and become a stokc like BYND or SPCE.

1. Pure play, if you wanted to invest in online fantasy gambling and sports gambling this company is your only choice.

2. Once loyal users of the platform hear about the stock being public will start pilling ln.

3. Once there is a hint that sports will come back (maybe without audience) this thing will explode.

4. Once CNBC starts talking about a sucessful IPO everybody starts jumping in. 

In conclusion, i tried to inform myself as much i could about the company but coudn’t find any financials or 10K. Only found an investors presentation and how much revenue and users they have. I’m not sure i want to jump in this early but i’m afraid this is going tl be some SPCE/BYND hype train stock and i’m going to lose on amazing returns.

t3_g7va1y,investing,Boeing pulls out of $4.2 Billion Deal with Embraer,"Looks like [this decision was recently announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/boeing-pulls-out-of-4-2-billion-deal-for-embraers-commercial-jet-unit-idUSKCN2270KN).

&gt;SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Saturday said it had canceled a $4.2 billion deal to buy the commercial jets division of Embraer (EMBR3.SA), unraveling years of work on what the Brazilian planemaker expected to be a transformative move.

Does this reflect a strategic effort that will give shareholders optimism about Boeing's financial security, or does it suggest a ""bad news to come"" scenario?

$BA shares hit a low of $128.39 yesterday, after they announced production cuts and pushback of timeline to bring back the MAX fixes.

**Edits:** 

I wonder how much of this is to free up money to pay debt that is going to be [due in 2020](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339778-boeing-737-max-bailout)?

&gt;**Boeing short-term debt and interest payments**  
&gt;  
&gt;The next portion is Boeing's borrowings, and that is obviously what brought the company in problems with another crisis hitting many industries; Boeing borrowed $25.4B in 2019 and fully used its $13.8B credit facility. From the $25.4B, $12.2B was used to make debt repayment. Boeing's current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt is $7.3B. While many companies are now tapping into their credit lines, Boeing already did that last year, which, by no means, is a positive indication. I also modeled in Boeing tapping its $9.6B revolving credit facility, of which $3.2B is due by the end of October 2020, though Boeing does have the ability to extend the termination times by a year.  
&gt;  
&gt;I estimated that Boeing would pay around $800-950 million in interest on their debt at the end of 2019 and a hefty $1B fee on their $13.8B delayed drawdown arrangement as well as a significant fee on the credit line agreements.

***Further, some speculation that Embraer say's this agreement was wrongfully terminated:***

&gt;[Embraer believes strongly t](https://leehamnews.com/2020/04/25/embraer-boeing-wrongfully-terminated-jv-will-seek-remedies/)hat Boeing has wrongfully terminated the MTA, that it has manufactured false claims as a pretext to seek to avoid its commitments to close the transaction and pay Embraer the US$4.2 billion purchase price. We believe Boeing has engaged in a systematic pattern of delay and repeated violations of the MTA, because of its unwillingness to complete the transaction in light of its own financial condition and 737 MAX and other business and reputational problems.

Recent press conference this was specifically mentioned for scale. I think Microsoft is planning a Machine Learning Store for commercial purposes working like the App Store for pre-made models.**

——————————————————————

As some of you may or may not know, Power BI has the ability to add pre-made machine learning and deep learning models internally

Once I learned about this I knew where Microsoft was headed

I’m thinking machine learning and AI will be a sort of addition to power bi users completely nulling the need for learning code, why?

Microsoft’s job is to make it as easy as possible for everyone to use their systems and this is why I think Microsoft will have a similar variation of the “App Store” for machine learning models and algorithms

Actual engineers will have the unique experience to be sort of like an app developer where they develop their code and publish it in the App Store and people using Power BI will be able to either download it for free or for a small fee

In their recent press conference about Power BI they mentioned pre-made models being directly implemented into the power BI software and said that this was done specifically for scale

In my opinion, I really think this is the direction Microsoft is headed with their Power BI software and their implementation of scale through Machine Learning for everybody

t3_g7trzq,investing,How will the economy fundamentally change because of COVID-19,"I posted this as a comment but thought it would make a good post of its own. The people who keep bleating ""pRiCeD iN!!!11!"" I think are failing to recognize that the economy is undergoing profound changes, and we are only beginning to have the vaguest sense of what the implications are of those changes are.

I listed out a few industries below that I think will be permanently and negatively affected because of COVID-19:

* Commercial real estate - totally fucked. Many white collar businesses have just had to make massive investments to get their employees to be able to work from home, I know my company has (goodbye bonus). You think they will just force everyone to return to the office in two months when things start to open back up? You think they won't realize how much money they can save on rent by just making everyone work from home permanently (essentially making employees shoulder their rent costs)? You think employees will want to return to the office when they have gotten comfortable working from home, not having to commute and hour and not having to pay exorbitant amounts for child care? GTFO

* Tourism - the days easy international travel are over. No more quick getaways to Europe on Ryan Air for $99 or whatever. It's going to be a long time before countries start letting in tourists and other non-citizens like they used to, given that the Cornonavirus outbreak in Italy may be been started by [two superspreader Chinese tourists](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/italy-links-coronavirus-outbreak-to-chinese-tourists-p8002005p), although granted they are now thinking it was in the country earlier. But point is that international travel will be extremely difficult if not impossible for the foreseeable future.

* Oil &amp; Gas - less commuting (see commercial real estate above) = less need for gas = less need for oil.

* Cruise lines - need I say more?

* Malls/retail - no one is going to risk their life to go shopping when they can just order from home, COVID-19 is just accelerating the death of brick-and-mortar retail.

* Restaurants - You spend less money taking out food than actually dining in at a restaurant. Similar to malls/retail, no one is going to risk their life just for the privilege of paying to sit down at a restaurant where the waiter is wearing a mask and [you will have to use disposable menus and plastic knives and forks](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-restaurants-changes-5717e86b-e9a4-4cb6-9963-85411e910107.html)

t3_g7tr4i,investing,Half joking: long INTU because of USO?,"There are now nearly 200,000 Robinhood accounts holding USO, not to mention all the other holdings of various oil products that are structured as partnerships (like DBO, UCO, USL and others.) That's at least nearly 200,000 people that will get a K-1 form (when you invest in a partnership you get a K-1) next year (K-1 printer go brrrr) and you have to pay for an upgraded Turbotax to enter that information.

When has there ever been this much retail interest/piling into products structured as partnerships? I can't recall. Additionally, while USO is having a reverse split, there was a massive amount of additional shares created recently: **""So, after an incredible orgy of share creation that increased USO’s shares outstanding to 1.449 billion yesterday from 156 million at the end of February.""** (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/04/22/a-plummeting-share-price-and-upcoming-reverse-split-show-that-uso-has-outlived-its-usefulness)

Will some people go to an accountant? Sure. But a lot of people will use Turbotax and find that they have to upgrade next year. So, next year INTU will get at least a decent amount of added business because of all this USO ridiculousness.

For example if I would want buy Apple stocks if they would be 20% lower in price why should I not write cash covered puts with a -20% strike price? 

Best case, I get what I want and I can buy the stock -20% lower, worst case I get the premium and no stocks. Of course the stock could also fall -30% and I would have to buy them at -20%, but who says I would have timed the price movement better if I just waited for the stock to fall and bought at my price goal anyway leaving me at the same situation?

Only downside I see is that you always have to buy 100x stocks at once and depending on your capital this can mean you are disproportionately invested into a single company.

t3_g7pk7n,investing,Stay defensive,"Yo, I came across a very interesting read: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1813987?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents 

It talks about interest rates during the Civil War and WW1. To summarize, the market rate of interest should generally follow the below formula:

Interest Rates = Pure Interest + Risk Premia + Frictions

Where pure interest is the risk-free rate (set by time preferences) and the risk premia consists of: risk of default, currency devaluation (relevant if $ pegged to gold), risk of high inflation etc. During war periods, you would expect all three factors to rise.

During the Civil War interest rates generally did increase. However, during WW1, the U.S. increased the money supply so voluminously that interest rates stayed level until 1917. The takeaway is that monetary policy is far more powerful than the supply / demand actions of the population.

The kicker -- the U.S. entered two sharp recessions following WW1 as reserve requirements stretched thin needed to be scaled back and the money supply curtailed as to maintain convertibility to gold. 

We have a similar situation in COVID world. The fed has set reserve requirements to 0 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm Also, the fed is dumping dollars into the market ($40B daily), buying securitized corp debt (unprecedented) and even non-IG debt! We are witnessing a 1-m rally in the equity markets during 20% unemployment. 

What will happen when this ends? Will this even need to end? Clearly it will need to end to some degree. Reserve requirements cannot stay at 0%. But does the Fed's balance sheet need to shrink? The answer is unclear. But, we do not need to maintain convertibility to gold unlike post-WW1. Also, during WW1, the economy faced immense inflation (+10%) which is not a factor here. 

I am not advocating for a complete shift to cash. The market and the fed's balance sheet can stay elevated far longer than what you think is possible. I am however advocating for caution and an awareness that asset prices could collapse anytime. Buy nothing that you wouldn't hold for 1 economic cycle.","Stay defensiveYo, I came across a very interesting read: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1813987?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents

t3_g7pixx,investing,Why USO is trading at a premium?,"Why USO is trading at a premium? Does it mean it will come down soon.

Edit: Here's my thought in more detail:

Now USO is trading at a 6% premium.

If SEC approves new creation baskets, bang! premium drop to 0. If oil price stay the same as now, that's a 6% instant drop guaranteed. Everyone holding USO should be selling now to avoid getting further crashed. But this is not happening. Why?

The only possible reason I can think of:

1. Short recover.
2. Dumb money coming in. (Everyone should be scared by now, right?)
3. SEC won't approve new creation baskets soon, by the time it approves, oil price will go up at least 6% to offset the premium.

If it is case 3, won't the best play be short USO and long the underlining future contract, and pocket that 6% profit, typical arbitrage.

If it is case 1, still the best play is not to recover the shorts now, but buying the underlining assets. (Well, maybe they are already doing it, and that's why the oil price went up a bit these few days, but why the gap is not closed yet?)

So it must be case 2, those dumb money see oil going up and dump in USO without think whether it is traded at premium or discount. The best play here is to short USO, and hedge with futures, right?

tldr, there's a market inefficiency here, and I don't understand why it hasn't been rectified yet. Why not Short USO, long CLN20 &amp; CLQ20? 

If I can see it, everyone else can see it, certainly the big guys. Then why it is not done yet, there must be a catch that I missed, what is it?","Why USO is trading at a premium?Why USO is trading at a premium? Does it mean it will come down soon.

t3_g7m4zn,investing,"Analysis: ""Big 3 Investing"" has beaten the market the past 25 years","I have done an analysis comparing purchasing the top 3 US market cap companies every year on January 1st and holding until today vs. purchasing the same amount of SPY on January 1st and holding until today (close price on 4/24/2020.)

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&amp;P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling. Another analysis worth doing might consider selling companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, that number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) lost to the SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

I have the individual stocks/annual lots broken down on a Google Spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dev1SaLhTjS7q_uuhdTwzTifi7ko24QdRCxx4jze7Ps/edit?usp=sharing).","Analysis: ""Big 3 Investing"" has beaten the market the past 25 yearsI have done an analysis comparing purchasing the top 3 US market cap companies every year on January 1st and holding until today vs. purchasing the same amount of SPY on January 1st and holding until today (close price on 4/24/2020.)

On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, that number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) lost to the SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

t3_g7lk1q,investing,Getting Filled for Options,"I am at a heartfelt blockade that is utterly annoying. I have not done all the research because that would consume weeks/months of trading days with transferring funds from broker to broker but I am wondering if anyone here knows of or has a broker that fills orders quickly for options trading. I currently use Robinhood. There are many problems I have with the platform though. Market makers on Robinhood undercut option buyers/sellers horribly. I can place an order for a vertical spread at $0.42 of credit per spread, then seconds after placing the order the new distance between the strikes only credits about $0.27 a spread. The price of the desired options fluctuate until the user gives into the undercut credit of the spread simply to execute their order. And this has happened to me countless times. I understand the credit is associated with the price difference of options on the option chain, but the fluctuation mainly occurs only when I place a desirable spread, and once I cancel my order the option pricing seems to stable out but at cheaper pricing. This also happens when I want to buy positions for options. I made the costly mistake this morning of purchasing a $ZM put without entering a limit price, meaning robinhood only gave me market value of the option, and immediately after my order was filled prior to the underlying stock even moving 20 cents I was already down $120. This frustration has reached a point to where I come on reddit to ask fellow options traders if they have a broker they are truly happy with. I have heard ToS (thinkorswim) has similar issues filling orders, and I have yet to experiment with TastyWorks (same creators of ToS) because he made the same platform that many users have the same complaints I have. I have heard but not done much research on Webull, E-Trade, or any major broker that has options level 3 available. Is there anyone that can give any advice on what to try next?

t3_g7kpyj,investing,Real Estate vs. Dividend Growth Investing,"I'm fairly young and new to investing with not much money in the market but I've been researching different forms of investing and I have an interest in both real estate and stocks. 

What attracts me is a passive income every month whether it be from dividends from stocks or rent from rental properties. 

I'm from Toronto so let's say the average home price is 800k and the average rent for 2020 is around 2k for a 4bdrm house. Having that 800k house as my rental property would provide me with (2000x12)/800k = 3% return annually. I know house prices/rent could be different in certain areas but I am using this as an example.

With 3% return on such a large investment and not even including all the other fees/bills you have to pay for owning the house in the first place, why would people not look at investing that money into stocks where you can get a decent yield on your investment in companies that pay safe dividends. Or even into REITs that pay an even more generous dividend yield. 

One argument could be owning the house in the future and having that large asset to your name, but stocks could also increase in value with dividends reinvested and compounded. 

Just some thoughts a 20 year old student with minimal investing knowledge has. Feel free to correct me for anything I may have misunderstood.

t3_g7i40k,investing,Hedging Portfolio with TED Spread,"Hi all.

Just wondering if it is possible to hedge stock market exposure by holding a short Eurodollar position and long 2 year treasury position. I know TED spread is technically 3 month vs. 3 month though. My idea is that credit risk rises during a crash so TED spread widens, and the Eurodollars hedge interest rate risk of a purely long treasury position. Also ignore the fact that TED spread is pretty high right now - I'm looking at implementing this later on.

I have the following questions since I am inexperienced with interest rate futures:

1. What ratio of GE:ZT should I be holding? I know GE face value is $1m vs. ZT of $200k but how does DV01 come into things?
2. How much leverage should I generally be using to sufficiently hedge market exposure? e.g. turn 1 -&gt; 0-0.5 market correlation
3. Does shorting GE implicitly go long 3 month T bill since you are lending/borrowing at the risk free rate?
4. Any other things I should be considering?","Hedging Portfolio with TED SpreadHi all.

Started to glance at DraftKing’s S-1 today and I am having a tough time understanding the ownership breakdown post-business combination between DEAC and SBTech. I get that DEAC is essentially = ~40mm shares converted 1:1 with DKNG class A but in addition the section adds:

“186,831,051 shares of New DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the DK Equityholders applying a 0.3546 exchange ratio, and 393,954,594 shares of New DraftKings Class B common stock are issued to Jason Robins, 40,861,997 DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the SBT Sellers, applying a 1,001.5 exchange ratio there will be an aggregate of 313,077,942 shares of New DraftKings Class A”

Bloomberg shows 313mm as the equity float with a $6bn market cap, is that correct? It seems like there is a ton of dilution not being accounted for based on the current share price. From the articles I’ve read about the merger announced in December, initial valuations were at $3.3bn, so not fully understanding the huge increase.

Today's amount: $38,401 (+$8,401)

**Scenario C:** 1/3rd in each of GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, the three largest companies in 2015

Today's amount: $81,270 (+$51,270)

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns.

NOTE: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

**Here's the most important bit - you should never have to pay for help with your student loans.  There isn't a person or entity on the planet that can get you a better deal, or access to a benefit or program, that you can't get yourself, for free, by working directly through your loan holder.**

The second most important bit is the old school - if it sounds too good to be true, it almost assuredly is.

While it's not illegal to charge for student loan help, many of the companies that do also engage in what is absolutely fraudulent and deceptive behaviour.  If you experience any of the following, we here at /r/studentloans encourage you to report it to your local attorney general's office and the Federal Trade Commission as well as the Department of Education.  All of these entities are actively pursuing and taking enforcement actions against these companies.

Warning signs/things to report:

Company claims to ""work with"" or partner with the Department of Education on any of the student loan servicers

Claims you can receive forgiveness, especially before knowing anything about your student loan balance and loan type

Mentions ""the Obama forgiveness program"" - there's no such thing

Creates a sense of urgency for you to sign up right away

Asks for a power of attorney over your loan accounts

Asks for any of your FSA or other passwords or PINS (never give those - to anyone)

Many of these companies ask for a large up front enrollment fee - anywhere from six hundred to twelve hundred dollars and then a monthly fee of around 39 bucks.  They often infer that the monthly fee is actually your student loan payment.  For these fees they will consolidate your loans - which you can do easily - for free - at www.studentloans.gov and often put the loans in forbearance - so no payment is due but interest is still accruing - and take you thirty nine dollars every month to ""monitor"" the account - i.e. do nothing.

I have personally worked with a borrower who had been in repayment for fifteen years when she was snagged by one of these companies.  They had her sign a POA and used it to change all the contact info on the account to their own address and phone number.  She paid a few thousand up front and the typical thirty nine bucks monthly - she thought that was her payment.  After three years she gets a call from the feds - her loan was in default and double what it was when she started.  They'd put it in forbearance until they couldn't anymore - then just let it go delinquent and default and disappeared with her money.  The feds only found her through skip tracing.  And there was nothing anyone could do for her

t3_ghp77u,StudentLoans,Update on credit bureau reporting for COVID waivers - also some new info on IDR recertification,"Hi there.  This weekend many of you reported that your credit bureau reports showed your status as deferred or in forbearance for loans that are eligible for the covid waivers.  Some of you also showed a credit score drop because of it.  As you may know, the CARES Act requires that these waivers be reported as if you were on time and making payments.

I've spoken to several folks in the industry and am told that the issue is one of system programming.  Up until now, there were no forbearances or deferments that should be reported as anything other than a forbearance or deferment.  The servicing systems had to be reprogrammed to report these waivers as in repayment and receiving payments even though they are actually in a forbearance.  That took time.  The servicers must report to the credit bureaus on the 10th of each month.  While they were able to get the waivers placed on the accounts by then, some were not able to complete the additional programming needed to correctly report the status by the April 10th reporting date.  Hence the deferred status on the credit reports.

I am told that for most if not all - i believe all - of the servicers, this programming was completed in time for the May 10th (really today since the 10th was a sunday) reporting so all the accounts should be updated in the next few weeks.  I suggest checking your credit reports in a week and if not updated in another two weeks.  If not updated in a month let me know.

As far as IDR certification goes - they have been pushed out by six months.  You can still recertify on your anniversary date even if it falls during the waivers - but if you don't want to you can wait.  Just keep an eye on any correspondence you receive to make sure you aren't waiting too long and end up with capitalized interest.

EDIT:  If there's anyone living in Georgia that is willing to be on camera (from your home via zoom) with an Atlanta news station - and that was negatively affected by this credit bureau issue - please let me know and I'll connect you with the station.","Update on credit bureau reporting for COVID waivers - also some new info on IDR recertificationHi there.

 Not sure if this is the right place to post but I see a lot of people posting about their debt journey and how they paid it off.

I feel like this content would help inspire others who aren't doctors/lawyers/engineers.

It can be discouraging reading other peoples debt journeys when they have a ""leg up"" so to speak salary wise. For example, I can't live with my parents. Not an option for me.

If this is of interest to others, I will post my blog (not started yet), but I feel like I can't be the only normal person that is able to pay off debt and still somehow get by.

t3_ghz2d7,StudentLoans,"Conflicting advice for mountain of debt (high salary, frugal lifestyle)","Hello all! I'm extremely happy with my career, but it's landed me with quite a bit of student debt.  

The only debt I have is my student loans (All direct federal loans) and ooh boy get prepared for some sticker shock:  
Total debt: $595,569.81  
I am currently enrolled in REPAYE and making no payments because I had $0 income on my 2018 tax return. Please understand my reasoning for choosing this method of payment.  
Here are my payoff choices as I see it:  
1. income based repayment at about $1500 per month with 25 year loan forgiveness/corresponding tax bill of $300,000 ish = $750,000 paid over 25 years  
2. refinance loans and pay off in 10 years- assuming 4% refinancing, the bill would be about $6,060 per month, which is my entire take-home pay, so this is not currently a feasible option = $727,200 total paid over 10 years  
3. change career tracks entirely, go into Public Service Loan Forgiveness job for 10 years, pay income based repayment about $1,500 per month, balance is forgiven after 10 years tax-free on qualifying loans = $180,000 paid over 10 years. 

PSLF seems like an obvious choice, but I'm not so sure. The current president has talked about ending the PSLF program, which really makes me nervous. Also, while public service is certainly worthwhile, it's not how I want to go for professional reasons. Additionally these jobs are highly competitive and even if I find one, it might require me to uproot and move somewhere else entirely. I'm also really happy in my current job/area, and I have lots of room to improve myself and my situation. My salary has the potential to double or even triple with bonuses. So, my current choice is to go with option 1) 25 year loan forgiveness with ridiculous tax bill. 

Recently a mentor recommended refinancing to a 30-year term in order to free up cash flow, and pay off aggressively with any extra money. **Wouldn't this cost me more in the long run**? 

It's important to me to reach financial independence. I max out my 401k (15% of gross income) and put more than 50% of my take home pay into savings. Recently I just started to invest in index funds as a tactic to save up for the tax bill on my loan forgiveness.

t3_gi361j,StudentLoans,"Refinancing, surviving, etc.","Hi everyone!

I just graduated LITERALLY yesterday, and I’m already trying to get ahead in terms of managing my debt. I have $154k in debt from my undergrad (yikes, I know). About $120k is private from Discover with interest ranging from 6-8%, and the remainder is federal. 

I’ll be working as a nurse, so I know my income will be okay. My only other expenses as of right now is my car payment and insurance which is about $350/month, as I’m lucky enough to still live with my parents. Obviously, my loans aren’t going to be due until December, but I want to be ahead of the game instead of getting surprised with an outrageous monthly payment. I have okay credit. Credit karma said I have a 753, but when I had my credit pulled for an auto loan, it showed up as a 683.

Would I be able to refinance before they’re due in December? Or, would I be better refinancing around then? Basically, asking when the best time to refinance is. 

Also, has anyone refinanced similar amounts? What companies did you use &amp; how was your experience?
I’d also appreciate any possible tips on managing this insane amount of debt.

I’ll be working as a nurse, so I know my income will be okay. My only other expenses as of right now is my car payment and insurance which is about $350/month, as I’m lucky enough to still live with my parents. Obviously, my loans aren’t going to be due until December, but I want to be ahead of the game instead of getting surprised with an outrageous monthly payment. I have okay credit. Credit karma said I have a 753, but when I had my credit pulled for an auto loan, it showed up as a 683.

Would I be able to refinance before they’re due in December? Or, would I be better refinancing around then? Basically, asking when the best time to refinance is. 

Also, has anyone refinanced similar amounts? What companies did you use &amp; how was your experience?
I’d also appreciate any possible tips on managing this insane amount of debt.

t3_gi8qkd,StudentLoans,PSLF and Forbearance Question - Trying to Understand my Options,"I recently started a job with the federal government which I'm hoping will make me eligible for PSLF and my loans can be forgiven after 10 years. 


I was originally planning on opting out of the forbearance for the Cares Act as I'm still working but I've been reading into it more and people have said not to make extra payments if you are planning on having the loans forgiven. Instead put that money into an emergency fund or the like. 


Regardless of whether I'm able to enter into the PSLF my loans are on the REPAYE plan so they would be (hopefully) forgiven in 20-25 years. I'm only 4 years into my payments.


I'm looking for advice- should I opt out of the forbearance? Should I just make extra payments towards the high interest loans? (I have multiple loans under my servicer with varying interest rates, both subsidized and unsubsidized and all are federal) or should I put that money elsewhere and just continue making payments when the forbearance period is over?","PSLF and Forbearance Question - Trying to Understand my OptionsI recently started a job with the federal government which I'm hoping will make me eligible for PSLF and my loans can be forgiven after 10 years.

t3_ghzoll,StudentLoans,First time Student loan questions/options?,"Hey everyone, I apologize in advance as I have a particular case and would like some feedback, opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be going back to school in the fall. Going in as a freshman at 24 (Got my first degree from a community college in Unmanned Aircraft with no loans). I moved to another state for work, so, unfortunately, I won't qualify for instate until the summer of 2021(I have every intention of staying in this state to live and work, and can prove so). I have filled out the FAFSA and maxed out my federal grants and student loans. I have emergency savings, however long story short what I had in my regular savings was used for medical bills due to a not-at-fault car accident last year. I should be able to get that money back whenever the suit completes, which could be another 12 months at this point as its being dragged out. 

I am unable to both pay for school and my living expenses working part-time while in Out of State classification due to cost.  I have already set up everything to get into the engineering program, and my spot would not necessarily be held if I took a gap year, so that is something id like to avoid. My credit is not the best right now, and currently only got approved with Sallie Mae at 9% for 20,000. The rest of the semesters, ill be able to pay out of pocket. 

My question is, do you think that taking the loan out for 9% to get me through this school year is worth it? Any other ideas on other places I should try applying?  Also, would it be easy to refinance in 1-2 years when my credit is better? (I've been slowly increasing it over the last 6 months and it is a priority in my life)

1. Starting salary will go from $60k --&gt; $350k.

3. My budget will allow me to pay about $10k/month toward my loans (I will make a lump sum payment at the end of the current interest free period). Because of this, if I stay on PAYE there shouldn't be any interest capitalization that occurs for my next recertification when I no longer meet the ""financial hardship"" definition.

t3_gh2o2e,StudentLoans,Student Loans Are Being Reported To Credit Bureaus!," Well, as it turns out, I went to go check my credit score this morning and had the lovely notification that it had dropped over 10 points, due to a comment by Great Lakes Educational Loan Services stating **""Payment Deferred""** on my April payment.

Alright, so let me get a few things straight:

* I **did not** choose to defer my payments -- My autopay was automatically suspended until November 2020, due to the CARES Act, an action explicitly taken by the servicer on ""my behalf""
* Per the CARES Act, any loan that is current (mine was) at time of ""relief"" (again, relief that I did not seek) is required to be reported as current through the end of relief, per [this explanation by Experian](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-the-cares-act-affects-credit-reports-and-scores/)
* This is now theoretically a statement that will ding me on a monthly basis through November, causing my score to drop significantly, as well as remain on my report for the **next 7 years**

How can I be negatively impacted by an action that **I didn't even opt to take**? An action that was **automatically taken by the loan servicer?**

I have been working extensively to up my credit since mid-last year and am nothing short of infuriated right now.

What would be the best course of action here? Contact the credit bureaus and dispute? I can't be the only one that's going to be hurt by this -- These are federal loans, which suggests many, many of us are about to experience similar impact, which will be very damaging in the long term.","Student Loans Are Being Reported To Credit Bureaus!

t3_gh96t3,StudentLoans,Is refinancing a better option than REPAYE after graduation?,"I'm a graduating med student with 200k+ in federal loan. Most of my classmates are going to do REPAYE instead of standard payment during residency, because they won't be able to afford the standard monthly payment on our low salary.

I'm now starting to think even if a private refinanced loan interest is slightly higher than the subsidized REPAYE interest, it might still be a good idea to refinance right after graduation?

Is it up to me about how much I can pay off each month in addition to the minimum? If I have money left over from the loan itself to pay back the loan interest, does that mean I’m taking out too much?

t3_ggpraf,StudentLoans,My fiance's afraid to apply for FAFSA due to her previous college years GPA,"My fiance had attended KU for four years a few years ago. In her last year there she battled with depression and loneliness; this made her grades and overall GPA suffer. She ended up leaving KU without graduating.

Now that she's ready to go back to school and finish her degree she's afraid to apply for Financial Aid because of something someone she works with told her.

This co-worker of hers told her that if she were to apply for FAFSA to attend this new school that they would have to pull her old GPA/transcript from KU and that would affect her GPA at this new school; possibly even making them not accept her. 

I have never heard anything like this, and I wonder if it's even true. But because she believes it to be true she's trying to get me to apply for loans for her to be able to pay for college. I don't mind this as I want her to succeed and would do anything for her, but I need to know if this is a real thing or if she's been told a lie.

Can anyone answer this? And thank you in advance for the help. This whole thing has been a central force for some recent arguments and stress.

TL;DR - My fiance thinks if she applies for FAFSA that she may be unable to attend a college based on her old college GPA.","My fiance's afraid to apply for FAFSA due to her previous college years GPAMy fiance had attended KU for four years a few years ago.

t3_ggtxj9,StudentLoans,Longtime lurker - thank you unknowns for inspiring me!,"Like the post says I'm a longtime lurker of this page. I have seen a number of people in similar situations pay off their debt and today I finally said enough, I can do it. 

As I'm sure many of you know the CARE act has frozen interest on some student loan payments till October. So my husband and I made a plan, we looked at all the loans that I have, looked at their different interest rates and started to make some payments. This is a golden opportunity to pay off a lot more than I normally would be able to when interest is on.

Today I picked the highest interest loan that I had which was $2,976.74 at 6.8% and I (with my husband's help) killed it. I can't explain to you guys the feeling I had being able to cross a loan off and market at $0 owed! (: 

I'm hoping to keep on this path and continue to knock down my debt as quickly as I can. Thank you all again for the inspiration and hopefully sooner rather than later I'll be making the post that I paid off all of my student loans (:","Longtime lurker - thank you unknowns for inspiring me!Like the post says I'm a longtime lurker of this page.

t3_gh7gqg,StudentLoans,Question about Loans and Interest rate?,"Hello this just a quick question from an high school student who has not yet to apply to college and it might sound extremity dumb and misinformed 

Does student loan interests varies from what you major in college?

But if you do medical school you typically have to take out 200k in loans and have a rate of 4-8%

t3_gh2zh3,StudentLoans,Advice for what to repay off,"Hi everyone, 18M college student here

I currently have about 10k loans in my name (the rest are in my parents' name) and this number will go up an extra ~7k, since I have another year of school left. I was able to pay off about ~4k last summer but I still have ways to go.

Since I couldn't be in the dorms for the rest of the semester this year due to COVID-19,  I was refunded about ~3k.

My question is, since there are no interest rates currently, should I use the 3k to pay off more of my principal 10k debt?

The other thing I was thinking of doing is, in the fall, I'll probably have an apartment that costs ~700 a month and so I was thinking of saving up for that. 

Any other advice on what to do with the 3k?","Advice for what to repay offHi everyone, 18M college student here

t3_ggonln,StudentLoans,Took out a loan from Sallie Mae that I can't pay back and I'm contemplating suicide as the only way out,"This post isn't a rant, or a diss on Sallie Mae. I'm also not trying to get sympathy from anyone on this sub. I'll try to be as brief as possible.

I was an international student in the U.S., I took out a loan to pay for my studies, with the help from a co-signer. Finished college, got my degree, got a few jobs that didn't pay much, then had to come back to my home country because my student visa had expired.

The amount due I have to pay to Sallie May for the loan repayment is set between $400 - $500 (the total balance is around $30K). My family has been helping me make the payments, however, it can't go on for much longer. Our financial situation is deteriorating, and coming up with that amount on a monthly basis is near impossible.

I've spoken to Sallie Mae on several occasions about this. They've told me these are my options:

Forbearance - Of which I only get 12 months, and I've used 9 of those already.

Refinance - A procedure for which I'll need my co-signer to cooperate and give over financial information to Sallie Mae, something they're not willing to do.

That's pretty much it. Other than that, if the amount isn't paid in full each month, it will affect the credit of my co-signer radically, and there might be debt collectors involved, and I can't let that happen (my co-signer is a relative living in the U.S.).

There are documents from Sallie Mae that state that if the loan borrower passes away, under any circumstance, the loan is forgiven and the debt is cancelled.

This is basically the only option I have available where neither my co-signer or my family is affected financially. I've spoken directly to Sallie Mae about this and they've confirmed that, once the death certificate is produced, the loan is forgiven.

It's a tricky situation but given the circumstances I sincerely don't see any other way out. I've been living under stress, struggling to come up with this amount on a monthly basis, for the better part of the past couple of years. I'm just exhausted.

I'm not sure what I expect by posting this here. Certainly not a solution, nor validation. I guess I just needed to take this off my chest.","Took out a loan from Sallie Mae that I can't pay back and I'm contemplating suicide as the only way outThis post isn't a rant, or a diss on Sallie Mae.

My mother says I should take out a full $20,500, but she has almost $300,000 in debt from loans. 

She’s a veteran and also says she’s never paying them and has managed to find all sorts of loopholes and hasn’t paid on her loans for around a decade 

I don’t think I’ll be so lucky and I can’t entirely rely on her judgment here. My total loan amount would be around $55,000 if I take the loan... but what if I don’t get into a high paying position? That’s around $595 a month that I still have to pay (if I pay them off in 10 years; depending on interest rates).

t3_ggy1k9,StudentLoans,Subsidized/unsubsidized payment allocation,"So I have some federal loans through Nelnet. 8 groups, interest ranges between 3.7-4.6%, and amounts owed on different groups ranges between $2200-$5200. About $25k total. 

I don’t have a lot of money to be making extra payments right now, but.. I keep hearing that w/interest frozen right now it’s good to make any extra payments you can.

I’ve just been paying by account for 1.5 years because I didn’t quite understand (prob still don’t). 

So, if I made a payment right now, 1. would I pay by group and ONLY target the unsubsidized groups since these are generally worse? Or pay the ones with the highest interest rate? Although the interest rates really aren’t much different (3.7-4.6%) so idk if it would matter. **I guess I’m wondering if I can pay off any old interest that was capitalizing before interest starts accruing again.. so it’s not interest on interest.. if that even makes sense.. I’m a first gen college student so trying to figure all of this out.

2. Would the payment go towards the capitalized interest I still owe or towards the principal? I keep hearing it goes to principal, but idk if that’s the case since I still owe interest that accrued from before March.

t3_gg7zlp,StudentLoans,"$50,000 paid since I graduated one year ago.","Exactly one year ago I graduated with a masters degree and $60,000 in student loans. I had began my graduate program (costing $45,000 in loans) right after my undergraduate program (costing $15,000 in loans). 

Thankfully, both degrees were in pretty strong fields (both were in compsci + finance) and I was able to start working for $95,000. Since then, I switched jobs and am now making 110,000. 

I have spent the last twelve months living like a hermit, so this whole covid lockdown thing is basically what I would be doing anyways lol. I spend quite little on entertainment, I can’t remember the last time I was actually in a restaurant...

I spend about $2,300 to $2,700 in living expenses (most of which is rent really). 

I’ve been able to make consistent payments of $3,000 each month. With my recent tax returns, reimbursed PTO, and stimulus check I was able to recently make a $12,000 lump sum payment in addition to those regular payments.

So here I am one year after graduation with just $10,000 left. I feel pretty sure I can finish that in three months. 

There is so much I want to do after:
1. I’ve never been on a vacation before. Like, ever. I really want to see what all the fuss is about. I’ve heard good things about Cancun?
2. I really love interior design. I am excited to actually build my home with quality furnishings. My boss makes fun of my current apartment furnished with patio chairs. 
3. I’ve always been pretty skinny (150lb @ 6’0”). Once I finish SL, I’d like to bulk up on protein rich meals and focus my sheer force of will upon regularly hitting the gym. 
4. I’ve stopped dating for the last year to focus on my finances. I knew it’d be a grind and I didn’t want to share the emotional burden. Excited to rekindle that fire. 
5. I have a bunch of younger siblings about to start college soon. I’d like to contribute some of my income to help them avoid the stress that has loomed over me since I first started college.
6. I really want to be an early home owner. I’m only 23 years old right now, but I’d love to own a home outright before I’m 35.
7. Did I mention I haven’t eaten out recently? Ah I miss a quality served meal. I’d love to just eat out every day for one whole month regardless of cost. 

I am positively stoked to finish this up. Eliminating this debt has been the only thing on my mind since 2014... I can’t believe I am finally approaching the end of the era.

This is my first time taking out a loan, so my brain is frazzled from trying to process all of the information I've been reading.

t3_gfw5ey,StudentLoans,In a bit of a unique situation and need some advise!,"So as the title states, I'm in a bit of a unique situation and need some help prioritizing my finances.  I will try to be as clear as possible. 

Currently, I hold about $25k in federal student loans.  Zero debt anywhere else, only in in my loans. Make about 2.5K a month, maybe more if i decide to work OT.  I will be attending graduate school come January, so i will be taking out more loans, obviously.  My plan pre-covid was to pay the minimums and save money for school, take on the new debt, then consolidate/refi once I graduated and locked down a job. 

Now with the 0% interest I've been paying down a little more in hopes to get a little further.  BUT I've since applied and am now in a good spot to be awarded a US Navy scholarship that will pay me throughout grad school (they wont be paying tuition or the school, just a salary to me every month) starting January 2021 . I will own them 3+ years afterwards which I am very much looking forward to. 

Guess my question is do I continue aggressively paying down loans now and throughout school if I can afford it (while still taking on new grad loans), or simply continue to pay the minimum and continue on with the original plan?  Assuming I am awarded the scholarship, does being an active military member have any benefits on interest rates?  I will technically be active military while in school, but I know my loans will be in deferment at that point.    Assuming I do not get the scholarship, is my original plan a good one?

When I first graduated, I didn't know much and made the mistake of paying off four small loans with low interest and leaving the larger ones that accrue more.

Normally, for every 100$ that I pay in, I pay $40 to G, $25 to H, $20 to F, and $10 to E. Since the CARE act started I've been putting all my payments towards loan G, as it accrues the most interest. Should I keep making all payments towards G, or should I split it up between the others more? I was thinking maybe 50% of all payments to G with 25% each to F and H.

t3_gfi2ci,StudentLoans,Grad Plus Loan Question,"Going to keep this short and to the point.

During UG, me/my parents co-signed on some loans for me to finish UG. Unfortunately, I was unable to stay current on the loans. They are charged off. these are about 10 years old. Current credit score 680.

About 5 years ago, I tried to do a PhD, but dropped out due to not wanting to go to academia. According to my loan statement, I had a Grad Plus Loan for it, it was like 5 or 10k.

My federal loans are current and in good standing (consolidated) and I have been making payments monthly. I am hopefully heading back to school in Fall, and my degree is going to cost a pretty penny.

A. Will those charged off loans affect me in getting a Grad Plus Loan?

B. If I got a Grad Plus Loan before, and my credit actually improved since then, should I be eligible again?","Grad Plus Loan QuestionGoing to keep this short and to the point.

t3_gfel2q,StudentLoans,Looking for some encouragement,"Happy Thursday everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are currently in our fourth month of student loan debt snowball.  Other than our house and her car, it is the only debt we have.

When we first started in January, we had a combined total of $68,000 to pay off.  She had 3 loans \~$4000, $10000, and $25000 of which we have officially paid off the $4000 one in April.  I have one loan for $29000.

Our next loan to tackle is the $10k one, which I would like to have paid off by the end of the year.  We have been adding $1000-1200 towards the principle plus the monthly to drive down the balance for the target loan.

Is this the right thing to do in terms of paying them off early?  Is there anything else I can do?  I feel like this is going to take forever and feel impatient. We've definitely decreased our spending but aren't eating ramen every night.

Just really looking for some encouragement to keep going or Im open to any suggestions to optimize my game plan by changing things up.

Thank you all for your time and recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Due to COVID-19 and the removal of penalties on federally backed student loans, we decided to not make any payment on our $25k and $29k loans since they also won't accrue interest until September 1.  We plan to use those savings and apply them to the $10k loan.","Looking for some encouragementHappy Thursday everyone,

Can someone help me understand this as this is all new to me. Sorry if it’s a dumb question.I originally started my loan at $43,313. After graduating and accrued interest, I ended up at $47,203.26. 

My first payment was due in January of $514.70 out of that payment $141.38 went to my principal and the remaining $373.28 was applied to interest. 

My second payment in February was $514.70. $301.02 went to my principal and $213.68 went to interest. 

My third payment in March after COVID hit I paid $514.70 again. Except $316.07 applied to my principal and $198.63 went to interest. 

Why is it that my first payment went all to interest and almost nothing to the principal? Also, If I pay off the interest I accrued and ask Nelnet to apply the $3,900 to the areas that interest accrued will it make any difference?

Business in Management, 3-year program over three countries. France, Italy, Germany. It sounds all good and great, I was very happy to receive the news! But alas, comes the dark turn in the story.

See, much to my dismay, ESCP is only an accredited school to institutions in Europe (I.e. EQUIS) and not with the Board of Education here in the US. As a lower-middle-class American, this makes it very difficult as I cannot receive FAFSA support (I'm in the process of filling out my FAFSA anyways, in the event something changes) in any form.

To make matters worse, all the scholarships I've been applying to since last year? They all require the input of the school I'm attending from a [list of accredited schools](https://www.mba.today/schools/france). This isn't the professional source, but it contains the same names of schools in France that all the major websites and banks offer loans for. Not having my school on the list instantly means ineligibility, according to many of the sites. I assume they do this because they are scholarships that they send to the schools, as opposed to grants. Hell, even the pride-and-true ""private loan"" services I run into have the exact same procedure. Makes me wonder why anyone could see much of a difference.

Yearly tuition, for non-French nationals:€22,500

The aid this university IS offering, however, is the ever-so-common exoneration scholarships ""based on financial need"". I send them the financial information of my household, and I can get up to 50% exonerated from my tuition, which I re-apply to each year. The first year, they told me I am eligible for 70%, due to the pandemic (which helps). The following years are all dependent, regardless on the fact that I will be living alone and receiving $0 from family in assistance, on my family's income as well as mine.

ESCP does not offer housing. They do not offer grants. They have partnered with a French bank to give &lt;1% interest on loans, but it is exclusively for French Nationals (loans in general, not just the special deal). I simply need to live in a one-bedroom studio, they go on average  € 600 a month.

TL;DR I am going to business school for $12000 per year but I can't find any loan or funding options because Europe =/= America.

SOLUTIONS:

\#1So far, as I have been working nonstop since January before the pandemic (at a quite nice paying restaurant job), I will have saved up a total of $5000 by the end of May. In order to accept my enrollment into the school, I have to pay  €2500 euros of my year one's tuition by June 29 (I negotiated from the original date, which would have been MAY 11, two weeks after being accepted). Assuming that the minimum salary working minimum wage in Paris is  €1500 (roughly), I can certainly survive working full-time and doing school full-time with enough space between year one and two. That is the option better in the long-run, where I will not have to carry any debt for the first year at least. However, money will be tight, and I will be saving every dime for when I switch countries the next year and have to start all over with a new job and housing arrangement.

\#2I live in a very wealthy town (Naples, FL), and have worked among wealthy people in all the work experience I have gained over the years, even with some of the wealthiest people in the world. I don't intend to come across as condescending, it is just a plain observation I have made. My wealth nor status does not compare to the size of some of these people's careers. I've managed to get names and vague mentions that I may be able to meet with some connections, but otherwise I've been sticking to the internet to expand my network in terms of my education and funding (thanks corona). I may get lucky and someone may throw me a bone and offer me a grant for schooling. Or, one of you may know somebody with such ambitions/foundations/etc.

\#3Perhaps there are businesses out there who offer decent loans for students in my predicament, and hate to make themselves known on the inter webs. If this is the case, I would greatly appreciate some direction towards those organizations. I would at least want to take out a loan for year one, and work to pay off the rest of my education.

\#4

A strange man in a trench coat PMs me that so long as I meet him and his van downtown at 11 at night that he'll pay for my college and potentially throw some candy into the deal. I don't know if I will be able to resist this offer.

TL;DR#2 I can:

* Join the Rat-Race, work full-time
* Ask the CEOs for money
* Find Phantom Loan Company
* ???????

EDIT: Clarity. I'm looking for funding options, and ideas. Yes, I have the alternative of taking the typical path among my peers of going to UF/UCF/USF with my undergraduate paid for by the state, but the remainder is basically the same as ESCP, but now with the ability to take loans.","International Man of Being BrokeHi r/StudentLoans. I'm sure my abrupt and slightly odd first post makes it clear that I'm new here. But, it is all for the sake of getting as much advice as I can, for as long as I can.

t3_ge3qxz,StudentLoans,I officially have enough money in my account to pay off my student loans and I don't know who else to tell!,"Starting in 2017 I took out $16k in federal student loans to pay for grad school. I graduated in December 2018 but didn't start making payments on the loans until May 2019 when I started being self-employed, at which point I owed $17.6k because of interest.

Thankfully I was on an IDR plan and my monthly payment was $0 because I had no income while I was in grad school. I paid at least $500/month and by the end of 2019 I still owed $12.5k. I felt like was still in so much debt and had a slight breakdown. I had been gifted Dave Ramsey's ""Total Money Makeover"" book, I read it, and I was resolved to really buckle down and pay as much as possible every month.

I was doing really well and had paid all but $7900, but then COVID-19 hit, forbearance and 0% interest kicked in on the federal loans, and I've been saving the money that I would've been using for payments just in case my partner or I lost our jobs (thankfully they seem to be pretty secure).

Anyway, with the money I've been saving, plus the $1200 stimulus payment, plus the $1k forgivable small business loan (which is technically a grant) that I just got approved for, I have $7900 in my savings account. Exactly enough to pay off the loan (which I'll be doing in September once the interest starts accruing again).

I just wanted to share my story because I feel like it's a weird thing to talk about with my family/friends. I'm still in disbelief, and even though I haven't technically made this last payment yet, my current net worth is $63... it's the first time it's been a positive number in over 3 years, and I could cry with how relieved I am to be DONE!","I officially have enough money in my account to pay off my student loans and I don't know who else to tell!Starting in 2017 I took out $16k in federal student loans to pay for grad school.

t3_ges7xz,StudentLoans,Have a credit on my UAS accounts after consolidation and they're giving it to the servicer I consolidated with rather than me. Is that right?,"I have two accounts with UAS for my Perkins loans, one through UASConnect and one through UASEcho.

Is this right? At least on one of the accounts, the amount overpaid is the exact amount of a payment I had posted the same day that the consolidation check posted, and so they either arrived at the same time or mine was minutes or hours before the consolidation payment arrived at UAS. Is it true that any overpayment in consolidation should be sent to the consolidator rather than to the borrower?

I had a problem in the beginning of my 3rd semester where my advisor had put me in the wrong class, so I emailed him to put me back into the right one since I had no knowledge of the second level programming course he had put me in. I ended up getting back into that class and I thought things were okay until I went to sign up for my 4th semester classes.

I had found out that I was charged around $800 for dropping that class, even though I was put in that class wrongly. They didn't say anything about it and made me sign a paper saying they were going to take that money for the dropped course from my pell grant and pay it off, but I would have to complete the next course classes or I would have to pay for those in full.

When spring break started my depression came back from my family and I was having suicidal thoughts, I talked to a counselor about the probation and she said they couldn't do that and that I should talk to my advisor to get a refund, but I wasn't able to do so because of the coronavirus and me taking a couple of months to calm down.

Right now I am emailing my counselor to help me with medical leave and to sort out that weird probation, but I am worried I will have to pay back the classes because I didn't do them while taking care of my mental health during these last 2 months.

I really need that money to move out later this year to get away from my abusive family, but they're really controlling over me and have threatened me for my money/pell grant money, and are waiting to see if I have to pay back those classes

Any help would be appreciated

thanks","Will I still have to pay back my classes after going through with medical leave?Hello everyone!

t3_geh9os,StudentLoans,Adverse credit for gradplus loan,"I'm looking over the requirements for adverse credit for grad plus loans and I am a bit confused.

I read the regulations backwards and forwards. Does someone have adverse credit if the only bad debt they have are chargeoffs from 3 years ago and open collection accounts based on those debts.

It seems that regulations say that when they say open collection account or charge offs within 2 years of the credit report date. In other words someone could not have their debt paid off but since the debt isn't current.....

I even read the response to comments on the Federal Register in 2014 and it talked about a 2 year lookback window as in they are only interested in chargeoffs and collections account in that 2 year window. The other baddies like liens and repossessions kept the 5 year look back window.

Am I misreading it?

I have collections that began 3 years ago but they appear current on my credit report, because each collection agency that buys the debt resets the clock. I have no foreclosures, unpaid federal loans etc. Do I have an adverse credit history? I haven't taken on any debt in the last 5 years, but have old collections I plan to let age off my report. The debts are over the $2085 threshold too.","Adverse credit for gradplus loanI'm looking over the requirements for adverse credit for grad plus loans and I am a bit confused.

t3_gdwys3,StudentLoans,No longer a Navient “Customer”,"I went back to school in my late twenties around 2009. I transferred to a state university and finished up with a business degree in 2013. At the time, I had just over $40K in loans, and was working odd jobs for a few years. I eventually packed up and moved across the country to an area that was doing well economically. I’ve been working office jobs here for the past four years; I got a certificate in this time and generally spent money on frivolous things when I wasn’t applying it to my loans. This was a mistake. I could have been out of this much earlier. 

I’ve been throwing every extra dollar I’ve earned towards my loans since last October or November. I had a premonition that the economy might be headed into recession given that we’re on a ten-year cycle for it historically. I divested all of my hobby stocks last year and stopped contributing to my 401K to dwindle the loans down quickly. 

I’ve been lucky enough to work from home for an essential company during the COVID-19 pandemic;  I realize that I am in a unique situation and many others have been adversely affected to the point where they are worried about things like rent. I haven’t taken this for granted, and have still lived as frugally as possible. 

Even though payments were deferred through the fall, there was no point in waiting. I paid off the last bit of them yesterday. The dark cloud has been lifted from over my head. There’s no time for celebration. The pandemic is ongoing, and there is still some economic uncertainty. I also have a car to pay down, hopefully before the end of the year. 

I would say to anyone who needs help with their own loans to listen to Dave Ramsey and you’ll get some motivation. He’s not perfect, but he gets a lot right. Think minimally in your lifestyle and you will get much further along than trying to fulfill all of your wants. Debt sucks; it makes you poor. I’ll never take it on again without having a strategy to get rid of it quickly.","No longer a Navient “Customer”I went back to school in my late twenties around 2009.

t3_gecpch,StudentLoans,Getting first time calls on a Perkins loan 10 years after school?,"Federal Perkins loan - Perplexing situation

Good morning Reddit,

There is a problem that has recently come to my attention and I'd like some advice or just to hear if someone has been in a similar situation before:

I've been out of school for 10 years now.  (Since 2010) I had originally defaulted on my federal student loans a few years after that.  I ignored my debt up until about 4 years ago and I called to get everything consolidated and on an income driven repayment plan through fedloan.  After getting everything out of default, my credit started to improve.  My score after 4 years is now in the 800s.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my problem; I've recently been contacted by a debt collection agency named ""Williams and Fudge"" based out of South Carolina.  The representative I spoke to informed me that I owe $3000 on a $1500 federal perkins loan that had, ""fell through the cracks"" and that they were managing it for my university.  I checked my account on the fsa website ([studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov)) and that perkins loan is now there. (It hasn't been on my account until this month)  It says this loan has been in default since 2011...this is where questions start to arise:

Why have I never been contacted about this debt since 2011? My information on record has been up to date for years.

How has this defaulted debt never shown on any credit report since 2011? I thought federal student loans aren't subject to the SoL and never fall off even after 7 years?

If this debt truly ""fell through the cracks"" after all these years, why am I responsible for paying double the original amount in additional interest and service fees that have been tacked on from Williams and Fudge?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Edit:

Going back through on my student loan history and talking to my parents, I had a total of 4 loans. (3 stafford loans and 1 perkins) My parents had taken care of the perkins loan with a lump sum payment to the university in 2011.  When I consolidated 4 years ago, fedloan consolidated my remaining stafford loans, said that was all I had and that I should be in good standing as long as I continue to make on time payments.

I think the university has an error on their end and is now trying to collect on a debt that has already been paid.  Maybe that's why they thought it ""fell through the cracks"".   I don't know what to do if this is the case.  How would I prove that now?  Like i stated, I've been out of school for 10 years.  I've taken care of all my past debt. (or so I was told until now)  I doubt my parents still have paperwork on a debt that was taken care of 9 years ago...I've worked too hard fixing my credit just to have something like this screw it up again...

t3_gealbv,StudentLoans,Down Payment or Pay off Student Loans?,"Hi all,

My husband and I have been saving for years for an eventual down payment on a house. He paid off his student loans before he met me, so the majority of the savings is from his years working. We live in  NYC so the housing market is insanely expensive, so our 70k won't go too far. We add about 2k-4k a month (based on OT, etc)

Three years ago I had close to 75k in student loan debt, right now I have about 38k left (I feel really accomplished by this - I started with around 9 different loan groups and am now down to two). 

One group is 7% interest, the other is 6% - right now everything is frozen so I'll be able to make more of a dent while in pandemic forbearance (who would have thought?  - insert Paul Rudd meme here). Long story short is: do we take anything out of our down payment savings to pay off this debt or do I pay off as much as I can during this no interest period &amp; then make regular payments as usual in September? We're so close to our goal of 100K in our savings (will hit that by next summer probably) that I don't like the idea of taking money out. The other side of me knows the 7% return is huge as well. 

To clarify one thing, the reason I'm most hesitant is because my husband has been working for the last 10 years and a lot of this is his savings. I've always managed paying my own student loans because I didn't want to burden him with my debt. He did help me pay off a 7K loan last year, which is huge &amp; I'm super grateful. I've only been making good money for the past \~3 years so that's why my loans have been decreasing steadily, not sure if i should just keep up what I've been doing or pay it off in full. 

Curious to know what you guys think!","Down Payment or Pay off Student Loans?Hi all,

t3_gebctf,StudentLoans,Calculating Expected Interest Accounting For Paying Off,"So I am thinking about getting a federal Stafford loan for graduate school which is at 6.08% interest right now. I need some help seeing if my math/logic makes any sense.

So I have 3 years of graduate school and I will be taking out $4500 each year because I need to have “income” which is 3x the rent to get an apartment. However, $3500 of that I otherwise do not need to be taking out. Therefore, I would pay back $3500 of the loan immediately and be left with $1000 in actual used loans for the first year. 

1st Year Loan of $4500: Using A = P(1 + r)^t that means this loan will cost me $306 (year 1) + $140.624 (years 2 and 3 based on the 1000) = TOTAL of $446.624. 

2nd Year Loan of $4500: $306 (year 1) and $68 (year 2) = TOTAL of $374

3rd Year: $306 (year 1)

GRAND TOTAL $1126.624 in interest and 3x $1000 of unpaid loans

Is this math correct? Can I pay off part of a loan the same year I get it. And am I missing any other costs that come with federal loans assuming I pay on time?

t3_ge8ib4,StudentLoans,Reconsolidating,"Hey guys, I’m new here so bear with me.

I graduated college in 2015 and finally got a hold on my finances per se. I currently have $50k in private student loans with 8-9% interest (3 separate accounts) and 1 federal loan with $20k. Unfortunately I fell into hard times within the past 2 years and missed 5 payments on my private loan (on my credit report stating 30-60 days late). It hurt my credit score severely and now I’m sitting on a 600 credit score. Now obviously if I want to consolidate my student loans I’ll have to build my credit score. So here are my questions, 1) what’s an average credit score to have to get a good chance of a lower interest rate consolidation? 2) now that I have all my student loans at current (nothing past due) will my past late fees affect the rising of my credit score? 3) when I finally get to a good credit score will the new lender deny me due to the past few late fees* even if I’ve been making full payments now for several months? (expecting 6-12 months until I finally reconsolidate)

*According to credit karma the late payments were within the past year, the last two were January and February 2020 so it was recent. 


Sorry if this sounds confusing, I’m pretty confused myself. Thanks in advance!","ReconsolidatingHey guys, I’m new here so bear with me.

t3_ge7kvu,StudentLoans,Question re: Defaulted Private Discover Student Loan,"I consciously defaulted on a PRIVATE Discover Student Loan 8 months ago. I simply stopped making payments, I moved out of the country and have changed my phone number. I have not been receiving phone calls. My co-signer on the loan, who agreed that defaulting was the best decision for both of us, still lives in the U.S. (New York) and said that he is ignoring daily calls from Discover. My co-signer has not and will not make any payments. 

I thought Discover would have sent the loan to collections by now, but they haven't. And they continue to call the cosigner. Obviously I want them to stop calling my cosigner. I also want to avoid going to court if at all possible, especially since I now live out of the country and do not want to have to come back at some future date to go to court.  Here are my questions:

1. Is there a way to get Discover to stop calling my cosigner without acknowledging the debt?
2. Is there a way to influence Discover to send the loan to collection instead of taking me to court?
3. Would logging into my Discover student loan account online be considered an act of ""acknowledging"" the debt and reset the clock for the staute of limitations?

When loan payments were frozen I diverted the monthly payment (as well as other money- I am lucky to be able to work from home so I'm saving on commuting costs etc) to my credit card debt. If I continue this pattern I am on track to pay off all the credit card debt by December 2020. *This includes the assumption that my student loan payment will resume in September.

t3_gd33gl,StudentLoans,IBR plan loan forgiveness too good to be true?,"I'm currently deciding whether to switch from my Income-Based Repayment Plan to one of these new, flashy student loan refinancing companies (Earnest, Laurel Road, SoFi, etc).

t3_gcp9ka,StudentLoans,Paid off 32k since last Feb!,"Hi all,

I just want to share exciting news that I have paid off almost 32k(31,500) since Feb 2019. This was a Wells Fargo private loan and I graduated 5/2018. I started working 08/2018 and I saved up about 10k. When my loan payments began in 12/2018, I paid the minimum for 2 months until 02/2018 when I forced myself to make a big 10k payment. The loan was split into one that was 14k+ and the other was ~17k. I paid $8,000 on the 14k one and then 2,000 to the bigger one to get the interest down. From there, I closed the smaller loan 04/2018 and then began on the bigger loan. It was hard but I still live at home, don’t shop much, and try to sell things on eBay as I can. I also picked up some babysitting (minimal, maybe made about $500-600) and transcribing for a couple months (maybe $500) but this all went to my loans. Any extra $ I had that I could spend, I put towards loans. I do have a 401k but I only do 3% and I do have a savings account but this is small ($100 a month) and will be until I pay off my debt. I still have about 20k in private loans and 25k in federal. I just refinanced my 20k loans from Sallie Mae from 7-11% interest down to 3.5% interest (used credible and its through pen fed now) so I will start paying this hard. Graduating with 80k of debt while half my counterparts all had school paid for is hard and the fact that I won’t be able to buy a house or move out as soon is also hard but I am doing it!  

I also traveled to Iceland, Denver, Phoenix, Mexico, and Ireland in the past year so I could’ve paid my loan quicker but I don’t want to miss out on experiences and be miserable with just work. I am proud I was able to pay this and travel affordably (orbitz/stalking flights until they were cheap/etc.)","Paid off 32k since last Feb!Hi all,

t3_gcivpy,StudentLoans,[Visual] I paid off approximately $32k of student loans in 2.5 years and tracked it all through data and graphs!,"Hi everyone, at the end of 2020 I finished my student loan payments! I've been a lurker on here for a while now and am happy to finally join the ""Paid in Full"" club alongside many of you! 

In addition to that though, I also have found an excitement in going through the data from my loan provider during this time and creating some charts for visualization purposes and some eye-opening takeaways. The first graph, [Total Loan Balance Over Time](https://imgur.com/BEgOfSc) shows the life **and death** of all of my 6 loans that I took out throughout my university studies, combined. The second graph, [Individual Loan Balances Over Time](https://imgur.com/zksFbBp) shows the life **and death** of those 6 loans broken out individually - as you can see I approached it via avalanche method. The purpose of doing this all was for me to visualize how interest works between Unsubsidized vs. Subsidized loans and how much it can grow over time. 

As a whole, some key numbers:

- Principal balance paid: $26,400
- Interest paid: $5,200 
- Total paid: $31,600
- Average payment: approx. $1000/mo

I was quite shocked when I realized that out of the total amount that I paid, 16% was in interest, and that's with paying it 4x faster than the 10-year term originally assigned, plus with my highest interest rate loan being 6.8%. I also learned that had it not been that I was continually exporting out my data from my loan provider, it would have been extremely difficult to access the .csv file and data. After I paid it all off, I was still missing some data from the last several few payments and my loan provider pretty much removed all access to my account history and it took several calls/emails in order to get that data as well as all proof of payment. So, lesson for anyone else interested in doing something similar, export out all your data before your last payment!

This was honestly an enjoyable little project for me - I would love to do something similar for anyone that is interested! There are a lot of other personal factors that I didn't want to get into at this time (income, living situation, methodology for payments, etc) but someday I may get more in depth and write a more thorough article or something like that, depending on the reception. I hope this was helpful for anyone or at least different than a regular ""I paid them off!"" post. I'd be happy to answer questions and would love to hear any comments!

So. A few years ago my student loans went into default. Last three years my tax returns were taken and applied to it. Which brought down the balance a lot. So I was grateful (although I really wanted that money in my pocket obv but it was my own wrongdoings that put my loan into default). 

Fast-forward to Covid-19 times. Interest has been brought down to 0% on loans, etc. Since my balance was so low because of this years tax return, I had the extra money to put towards it right now so I’m able to fully pay it all off while we are in the 0% era. So the last few weeks I have been putting a portion of my money towards it.

A few days later the payment applies, and part of it goes to principle and just a little over 15% of the payment applies to “other fees and charges.” It is not the interest column because that column is separate and is noted at $0.00.

However, my issue comes in with the new debt summary, amount owed. The balance is still always $80-$100 more than it should be. 

Example: balance is $1000.

I pay $600. $510/600 will show under principal. $90/$600 will go to “other fees.”

So the full $600 was used.

But my remaining balance will say $480-$500 instead of the flat $400. (Like I noted I’m only noticing and asking these questions because there is no interest being applied currently and there is no explanation on the site nor a FAQ page.)

Now I understand there are fees with every loan. But why is it not included in my full balance that I owe? When you do take any loan out I understand you wind up paying more back than you ever borrowed. I can’t help but feel like they’re taking way more money then they should right now or I’m just not fully knowledgable on where the rest of my payment goes? Is it taxes? If so, 15% in taxes????

Thanks for reading :)","With 0% interest being applied, balance isn’t reflecting my payment fullyHello! I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this before or has an explanation for it. I’m still waiting on an email back from the company.

t3_gcvqcc,StudentLoans,Enrolling to Graduate School in the fall of 2020- Guidance in securing the best Direct Plus Loan Interest Rate,"Hello,

I'm starting school in the fall of 2020 and am in the process for applying for loans and am writing this with hopes to get some guidance regarding my options.

I will be attending from the Fall of 2020 and based on the information I've gathered the program will cost me close $150,000.

I've applied for the Direct Unsubsidized Loan and will be borrowing $20,500. 

To secure additional aid, I will be applying for the Direct Plus Loans. In terms of the Direct Plus Loans, based on the FAFSA website ( [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans) ), when I tried to apply through the website, the university was listed as one of the university that said they are not participating in Direct Plus Loans. I have two questions I would like ask:

1st. Does that mean I will need to apply for a private student loan?

2nd. Due to the current pandemic, I understand current student loan payments are currently on hold. Would anyone happen to know if future student loans are offered at lower interest rate? or offer any additional benefit?

Thank you in advance for your insight.

t3_gceca5,StudentLoans,Question about pell grants and unsubsidized vs. subsidized loans,"Hello! I'm not sure if anyone can help me or not, but I'd appreciate any information given to me. :) Currently, I owe $16,000 in student debt (Bachelor's degree, business management) and my husband owes over $30k for an associate's he never finished. I'm just a little confused about pell grants and unsubsidized vs subsidized loans. When my husband and I went to our community college, we were like 18 or 19 but living on our own. No help from parents and didn't make a lot of money. Probably minimum wage. Somehow, all of my loans are unsubsidized so I've been charged a lot of interest already. My husband, well, I don't know how he owes 30k for an associate's degree at a community college. He went for several semesters, but don't think that's the reason he owes so much. I suspect there were maybe uncashed checks that were never subtracted from his balance. (I'm having him make some phone calls on Monday to find out why he owes so much. More than likely there were no errors, but I just want confirmation before we start paying this debt down.) This is where my question comes in: I know several people around my age who owe no money (or very little) on student debt because they didn't make much money and it was all covered by grants. Why would my husband and I not have qualified for this (we were dating at the time so our incomes weren't lumped together)? Does it have to do with when the applications were put in (first come first serve) or because of the application not being filled out correctly? If it comes down to an error of incomes not being recorded correctly, is there a way to go back and correct this (with proof) to where we wouldn't owe so much federal aid? (I know this isn't likely, but again, I just want to make sure I understand everything before I pay money all this debt off.) If we weren't going to get pell grants, that's whatever, but I really can't understand why we would have been hit with the loans that accumulated interest while still attending school. If anyone has any links that give more info on pell grants, different loan types, etc. I would really appreciate it.

t3_gcgbze,StudentLoans,Question about Grad Plus endorser,"Hello,  


I am needing Grad Plus loans to pay for school, and I have adverse credit. I will need an endorser. The only person I can get to endorse me is my mother, and besides a less-than-stellar credit score, everything else is fine. She is not 90 days or more delinquent on any accounts.  


However, my mother is now telling me that she remembers having some of her checks garnished, which she made arrangements with the loan servicer (federal loans) to stop the wage garnishments. She isn't a very tech savvy person, and she told me that she wasn't aware she was even in danger of garnishment. Apparently she was told that they tried to contact her multiple times, but she does not recall any letters (doesn't mean any weren't sent; they could have just not been noticed or whatever). She says if she was aware that they were going to garnish her wages and that she was supposed to be paying installments on her student loans, she had the money to do so and would have.  


She has no repossessions and is current on all of her accounts. I am afraid to accept an offer for pharmacy school because if I enroll and cannot secure any funds to pay for my tuition, I will have to withdraw. This will impact future career prospects.  


Is there any way that I can still use her as an endorser on a Grad PLUS loan? I thought about looking into whether or not we can dispute the garnishment (again, her wages aren't being garnished right now and she's making satisfactory payments for multiple months now) due to her not being aware of what was going on. Is there any way that I can explain this situation to the Department of Education to allow me to use her as an endorser?

I am now taking on the responsibility of paying of my parent’s Plus Loans for me (which sadly will be a total of $16k-19k depending on how much interest has accrued/how much they have paid off, wow I really regret taking out $10k to live on campus Freshman year). Since I am making more money now I hope to pay this off in the next year or less.

t3_gbzdbl,StudentLoans,How to apply payments during interest free/no payment period?,"I have a somewhat complicated loan scenario, including a private loan at 5.88% and about $140k in federal loans with interest rates ranging from 3.15% to 6.96%. I've looked into refinancing the private loan, but the offered rates aren't different enough to make it worthwhile. My federal loan payment was $733/month. I'm doing PAYE, so my payments are capped as a percentage of my income (obviously, but this point comes back later). I have a kid and a mortgage so I'm not paying a lot extra every month. 

What I'm trying to figure out is whether it makes the most sense to pay down the higher interest loans or the private loan. My assumption is that if I knock off $4398 (6x733) from my federal loans it won't lower my payments since my payment is a percentage of my income and still below the standard payment. So I would pay the $4398 off but then go back to the same amount going towards both the federal and private loans. If that were the case it would seem to make more sense to pay off the private loan faster, because that would actually free up income that I could then turn around and put towards the federal loans. Does that seem reasonable?

My loans are currently in deferment while I am working toward a PhD in Education on a part-time basis until 2024 or 2025, and as a result, I am not making any qualified PSLF payments. I am 46, live frugally, and plan to retire at 62. I drive a 22 year car when needed and try to pay cash as much as possible (Dave Ramsey approach without the PSLF hate). I should add that I am a single empty nester parent with just one income and on a limited budget in a high cost of living area (Northeast) so money is a little tight now. My PhD program is fully funded with nothing out of my pocket this time.  


Financially, I am better off to continue deferring and putting that money into retirement and postponing repayment until I graduate, but I also worry that the government will not honor PSLF someday as I am sure many on here do. So I see my options as the following:

1. Starting making qualifying payments now and get this out of the way.
   1. What happens if I make those payments and the govt wigs out anyway leaving me another 15 years of repayment? I would have been better off deferring in that case anyway.
2. Defer repayment. Put that money into retirement. Make payments beginning at age 51 and reach forgiveness around 61.
   1. Will I regret defferring if the govt wigs out in 11 years when I would have qualified for forgiveness under option 1?  


Background:

I have 236K in student loans. $120 for me personally (B.S. Comp Sci and MBA), and the remainder was taking in the form of Parent PLUS loans for my two kids. I was a single parent and foolish. I consolidated through Great Lakes into Two IBRs which had me paying $800 per month while making $60K per year which I did for 11 months through Great Lakes. It got transferred to Fedloan when I sent in the certification for PSLF. I work at a Community College.    


Fedloan said that Great Lakes put me under a terrible plan, and they ended up reconsolidating me under a single REPAYE that dropped me down to $432 per month. The catch was that my 11 payments counted for nothing and the ""clock"" was reset. Its a long story, and I was almost in tears when Fedloan explained it to me and hence why I am leary of any forgiveness now.  


So anyway, my first payment was due in February, but just after my loan was finalized and the plan released to me, my repayment was put in Deferment as my university sent a letter to them informing that I am a part-time student there until 2024. After talking to Fedloan to ensure nothing in the process was incomplete given the letters timing, I did the math and decided to use this for a year to pay off all my other debts beside my mortgage. I was also able to leverage my college into giving me a new position with a better salary ($79K). I expect to be ""debt free"" by December. Just the mortgage and student loans.","Are there any dangers in deferring student loan repayment if seeking PSLF?I am in a REPAYE program while working at a Community College.

I also will have an unspecified amount due in tax burden from grants and scholarships I received during my senior year of college (this year). 

I'm trying to decide if it makes more sense to take the discharge and set aside the amount I'd have paid in loans each month so I can cover the tax burden, or if I should waive the discharge in order to preserve the possibility of returning to school someday.

t3_gbq8xq,StudentLoans,What to do during grace period / before eloping?,"I'm in need of some advice. I have \~$17700 in federal student loans (\~$2200 in one with I think 6.25% interest normally, $15500 in another with 6%), which are currently at 0%/no payment required because of the COVID-19 grace period. I'm already seeking PSLF, have switched my loans to FedLoan, and am on REPAYE. Right now I make about $40k. My fiance makes about $55k and has no student loan debt. We'd been planning on eloping next year (provided we can travel to Ireland by then), and I'm wondering what the best financial steps are for me to take right now. It's also worth noting that I may consider a career change; right now I qualify for PSLF because my employer counts as a non-profit, but I am discovering that I quite like working from home. I've made 33+ payments on one of my loans, and 24+ on the other (not counting whatever isn't popping up since I last certified).

Things I'm worried about:

1. I think I need to switch my repayment plan away from REPAYE because of the impending marriage. I started college in 2006, and I think that means I don't qualify for PAYE -- but could for IDR? How difficult is that process?
2. I don't really understand the difference between filing separately or jointly... I do know that I historically get a refund, and he didn't this year. Is it financially better or worse to file separately or jointly?
3. Should I use this time where my loans are 0%/no payment to pay down my loans? Thanks to the grace period, I just paid off my interest and only have the principal remaining. I could, ostensibly, pay off the $2200 one. Or should I continue to save? I'm trying to get better at money and just now hit $10k in my savings account. Is it better to throw money at my loans or to keep stockpiling because we're looking at some upcoming life expenses?

Advice appreciated. I do not have a head for money at all, and this stuff immediately sets off my anxiety and makes it hard for me to process information, as much research as I try to do!

My current thought process is that I should hold onto money at least until the end of this grace period because who knows what may happen in terms of an extension or relief (a person can dream!), but I am considering the possibly immediate future and what makes good financial sense before a big life change.","What to do during grace period / before eloping?I'm in need of some advice.

t3_gbow5l,StudentLoans,Refinancing Advice - $191k,"Hi all,

I’m currently paying down $191k of fed loans on the extended graduated plan with about 20 years remaining. My “discounted” interest rate is 6.63%, which means I’m accumulating somewhere around $1,050 in interest every month. I currently pay $1,200 just to attack a tiny bit of principal but obviously it’s like a drop of water in the ocean and the interest is killing me. 

I’ve explored some refinancing options, but my giant principal means that the monthly payments would be more than I can afford (they’re already severely impacting my lifestyle as is). I have a great credit score and should be competitive for good rates. Should I look into potentially splitting up my loans amongst 2 private companies that way I can at least have a lower overall interest rate while paying roughly the same every month? Does that even make sense?

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.

t3_gbiirq,StudentLoans,Is it possible to change which company is collecting your debt?,"Hello everyone. I have been dealing with a lot of very concerning behavior from a company called F.H. Cann &amp; Associate recently.

When I fell into default due to unemployment, they recommended I apply for their program. Once I found a new job, I called back to apply. I filled out all of the needed forms and gave them all of the information they requested. I was then able to start the monthly payment of $50 which I had been paying consistently for 4 or 5 months, until they sent me a letter claiming I never applied. 

I called them about this, and they stated I never filled out a 4506-T form. I told them I did, I even read out the e-mail to them, the date in which it was sent, and mentioned confirmation I received from their people that it had been submitted. 

They adamantly denied this anyway and emailed me another one. I filled that one out, guy on the phone confirms it with me. A few days ago instead of me getting a letter this time, my brother who lives in a completely different state, finds the letter in my parents mailbox from the IRS stating they had to deny a request due to an incorrect address. So I don't know if FH somehow screwed that up, when they've been sending mail to the correct address for months with no issue, or if they're doing this on purpose.

They sent a voice message to me yesterday, stating that they are calling in an attempt to collect payment from me. Payment I can't give them, because I have been furloughed from my job due to COVID 19, and i'm still waiting on a stimulus check that I no longer have any hopes will ever show up in my mailbox. 

Whether it's their incompetence or something shady going on I want a different company to work with. I just want to pay off my debt, and that is never going to happen with F.H.

t3_gbihd1,StudentLoans,Is it possible to change what company is collecting your debt?,"Hello everyone. I have been dealing with a lot of very concerning behavior from a company called F.H. Cann &amp; Associate in recent years.

When I fell into default due to unemployment, they recommended I apply for their program. Once I found a new job, I called back to apply. I filled out all of the needed forms and gave them all of the information they requested. I was then able to start the monthly payment of $50 which I had been paying consistently for 4 or 5 months, until they sent me a letter claiming I never applied. 

I called them about this, and they stated I never filled out a 4506-T form. I told them I did, I even read out the e-mail to them, the date in which it was sent, and mentioned confirmation I received from their people that it had been submitted. 

They adamantly denied this anyway and emailed me another one. I filled that one out, guy on the phone confirms it with me. A few days ago instead of me getting a letter this time, my brother who lives in a completely different state, finds the letter in my parents mailbox from the IRS stating they had to deny a request due to an incorrect address. So I don't know if FH somehow fucked that up, when they've been sending mail to the correct address for months with no issue, or if they're doing this shit on purpose.

They sent a voice message to me yesterday, stating that they are calling in an attempt to collect payment from me.

t3_gb5hz1,StudentLoans,To Continue to Pay or Not? Considering Opportunity Costs During Cares Act Interest Pause- Federal Loans,"Hi There,

I did the math if anyone is interested I thought it might help. I looked at the scenario where a person had 10K of student loans at 5% - using the standard repayment plan- and whose interest was starting in April as the cares act hit.  Perhaps a bit unrealistic but it was the easiest place to start- imagine a person graduated in March somehow as campuses closed.  The 3 cases I considered are total interest paid and # of months to debt freedom for:

1. Had corona not happened (NO-Vid)
2. Using Cares Act and not paying during the interest pause (Cares Act Case)
3. Continuing payment through this interest pause (Fortunate Case)

In total here is what I found.

* NO-Vid- Total Interest Paid: $2727.70 debt free 120 months from April (April 1 2030 debt-free)
* Cares Act Case- Total Interest Paid $2727.70 debt free 126 months from April (Oct 1 2030 debt-free)
* Fortunate Case-  Total Interest Paid $2334.87 debt free 117 months from April (Jan 1 2030 debt-free)
* Total money saved  $392.83 total time saved 9 months

There are a lot of other variables you could take into consideration that also makes the continued payment interest. For instance- opportunity benefit of investments you could make with that additional 3 months of debt freedom using continued payment.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* I am in no means recommending continued payment- just showing you the math. Things you should consider before making any decision. Do you have a budget set? Is your income safe (relatively sure of continued income)? Do you have an emergency fund set up that aligns with your risk tolerance? These are all boxes you should check before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to do this calculation for other loan repayment plans, or loans at different periods in their lifecycle if this would be helpful to people? Let me know","To Continue to Pay or Not? Considering Opportunity Costs During Cares Act Interest Pause- Federal LoansHi There,

I looked at the scenario where a person had 10K of student loans at 5% - using the standard repayment plan- and whose interest was starting in April as the cares act hit.  Perhaps a bit unrealistic but it was the easiest place to start- imagine a person graduated in March somehow as campuses closed.  The 3 cases I considered are total interest paid and # of months to debt freedom for:

1. Had corona not happened (NO-Vid)
2. Using Cares Act and not paying during the interest pause (Cares Act Case)
3. Continuing payment through this interest pause (Fortunate Case)

In total here is what I found.

* NO-Vid- Total Interest Paid: $2727.70 debt free 120 months from April (April 1 2030 debt-free)
* Cares Act Case- Total Interest Paid $2727.70 debt free 126 months from April (Oct 1 2030 debt-free)
* Fortunate Case-  Total Interest Paid $2334.87 debt free 117 months from April (Jan 1 2030 debt-free)
* Total money saved  $392.83 total time saved 9 months

There are a lot of other variables you could take into consideration that also makes the continued payment interest. For instance- opportunity benefit of investments you could make with that additional 3 months of debt freedom using continued payment.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* I am in no means recommending continued payment- just showing you the math. Things you should consider before making any decision. Do you have a budget set? Is your income safe (relatively sure of continued income)? Do you have an emergency fund set up that aligns with your risk tolerance? These are all boxes you should check before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_gaxlew,StudentLoans,Should I take out a loan (UCONN vs WPI)?,"Hi everyone! I am currently deciding between going to UConn or WPI as an undergrad computer science major. If I go to Uconn, I will be able to graduate debt-free, but if I go to WPI, I will have to take out around $60k in loans. I know that WPI's CS program is a little better than UCONN'S CS program, but I feel that UCONN's CS program is still a great option. I also feel that I'd fit in at both schools. 

But I have heard so many people talk about how graduating college with no debt opens up so many opportunities. At the same time, from what I've calculated, WPI's debt seems to be manageable, but I know it will restrict my spending for several years. And especially during this time of economic instability due to coronavirus, I am worried that when I graduate, I will have to pay a lot more money/pay back for a longer period of time than before. And I have heard that the prestige of your undergrad school doesn't matter that much, even though WPI isn't massively above UCONN in terms of prestige.

So my questions to you guys are: Do you think it is worth it to go to WPI even if I have to take out $60k in loans for a moderately better CS program, or should I go to UCONN and graduate debt free? And how important is it to graduate debt-free?

If you guys could help me ASAP, I would greatly appreciate it, as the enrollment deposit deadline is tomorrow. Thank you in advance!","Should I take out a loan (UCONN vs WPI)?Hi everyone!

t3_gb660j,StudentLoans,Should I take the loans?,"To start, I'm only 20 so I don't have much experience paying pills or having my own income/expenses.I'm a current CS student at a pretty good CS university doing my undergraduate and the average starting pay is about 95k right out of college. I'm going to be about 50k debt when I graduate (maybe less if I can save money during internships).

I'm considering doing the 1-year master's program and getting my masters in CS, but that would put me in a total of like 110k in debt (worst-case scenario - the best case is that I find some TA/ Research position and get it down to like 80k). The medium starting salary from our master's program is 115k - Although this includes people who are late in their career and get a masters too.

Like, I said, I don't really know too much about personal finance, but, just based on those general numbers, is this a smart financial decision? or will be crippling myself during my 20s by taking the loans. Like I will eventually also need to buy a car and don't want to have to put that off. 

My parents would be taking out the loans so we can take out the 110k if needed and I would be paying them back. Also, since I'm CS, I'd probs end up working in a high cost of living area like Seattle/L.A

3. After grace period ended, applied for IDR, was put into PAYE (for grad school loans). Later I was told I shouldn't have qualified because I had an old Perkins loan.

t3_gazwwr,StudentLoans,How do I enjoy my 20s but also pay off my student loans? I'm really struggling with this concept,"Sorry this is a long one, but I need to know if my plan is sound and how to learn how to live my life to the fullest during this financially difficult time. I'm in my early 20s, just finishing up my bachelors degree. I owe $31,000 from this degree, all in federal loans with about a 4.53% interest rate. Now, I've decided to attend an accelerated nursing program starting in 2 weeks, which is costing me A LOT, and I have no federal loans left. I just had to take out a $42,000 private loan with a 10.74% interest rate :( 

So, my plan is to save money while I'm in this accelerated program for the next 16 months. I have enough saved for things I may need throughout my program, like textbooks, train passes, uniforms, emergencies, etc. I'm living back with my parents and can do this for free for as long as I want. My plan is to babysit 1-2 days a week and make $200 a week and save as much of that as possible during my program. My bills each month are less than $300, so the rest is for savings.

I'm expecting to make around $60k after I graduate next fall, which is actually lowballing it for my area and not including overtime or babysitting/side job gigs, which many young nurses end up doing for extra money. I'm very hardworking and have no problem working 60+ hours in a week. 

So, my plan is to save some of the money I earn during my nursing program toward a trip to Europe, travel immediately after I graduate next fall to celebrate before I get a real RN job (if I don't do this now I seriously never will have the time), and then go into a serious loan repayment period for 3 years. 

I plan to live from home, put $2000 a month into my loans each month (pay minimum on low interest federal and sink everything else into my private loans). This will completely knock out my private loans in 3 years. I'll have to live like a broke student for those 3 years, but I'm used to it. I'll basically have just enough to pay my loans, bills and have a little fun each week. 

After those private loans are knocked out, I plan to attend grad school. At this point, I'll have enough experience as an RN to become an NP. I'm looking at nurse anesthetist and psychiatric NP programs in my area. These jobs make well over six figures, so I'm not as worried about the boat of loans that will inevitably come with grad school.

 I know I have a reasonably sound plan to pay off this insane debt quickly (or at least I think?), but I'm having a really hard time grasping the concept of sacrificing everything now for a much better future. If I do this all the right way, I'll have no foreseeable financial stress from the age of 30 on. I just am worried that I'll waste away my 20s, while everyone else is getting married, starting families, traveling, and moving out. I'm just so focused on my career and having a really successful and independent future, but I do want to stop and smell the roses along the way and live out my 20s to the fullest, even if I'm financially suffering. I get so anxious that I'll look back and regret not just taking my time with my loans and enjoying life while I was young. This might sound ridiculous, but it's important to me.

t3_ga88h8,StudentLoans,Just Paid Off My First Loans,"
Just wanted to share the good vibes and encourage those who are struggling that it is possible. It was hard to picture paying any of them off when we first started out, but with some simple budgeting and a little self discipline it’s possible!

My wife and I had five loans between us for a total of $40,000 when we graduated three years ago (which I don’t think is that bad for a combined 12 years of college). We don’t make a lot of money considering we each have Masters degrees, but we’ve been pretty aggressively paying off our loans with the income that we have.

We decided to use the stimulus payment and some money from our fairly healthy savings and pay off two of the five loans.

We now only owe about $13,000 and we expect to pay the rest off in about 14 months (assuming neither of us get a better paying job). We’ve been using the avalanche method and are both now excited for the “avalanche” to start gaining momentum.","Just Paid Off My First Loans

t3_gam9b6,StudentLoans,Considering taking out a 401k loan to pay off remaining student loans... Advice?,"Hi folks, new to this sub, and considering potentially a large financial decision. I feel pretty out of my depth here, and could use some advice.

Short version is, I'm a college dropout with approximately 10k in student loans. I attempted to attend college while working fulltime because I'm a total lunatic, it didn't work out, and I eventually had to make a choice between the two. Steady gainful employment won out.

I'm looking at ways to reduce (or completely eliminate) my debt, and as of the passing of the CARES Act, I'm looking toward my 401k. I've only had it for seven years so I don't have a ton of money in it, but I do have enough to pay off my remaining student loans. My question is, would it make sense to take a loan out of my 401k for $10,000, in order to completely pay off my tuition?

The tuition loans have a 5.05% interest rate, and while I DO make enough to make the payments, it keeps my finances pretty tight, and makes it almost impossible to save any significant amount each month. With the interest being waived until September, I know I could stop making payments for awhile, but I'd rather find a way to get rid of the debt, for the sake of my credit score and overall peace of mind. I'm no genius when it comes to finance and tax law, but what I THINK I'm reading suggests that I could take the money out of my 401k at a lower interest rate, crush my student loans, and then essentially pay myself back over time, albeit with lower monthly payments.

Does this make sense to do? Are there any angles I'm not seeing? I have a decent job with relatively good security, and provided I don't get sick, I'll continue to work through the COVID19 crisis. I've made some questionable financial decisions in the past, and am in the process of repairing my credit, so I wanna make sure this isn't gonna hurt me down the line, before I make any decisions.

Any advice I could get on this topic would be HUGELY appreciated. Thanks in advance.","Considering taking out a 401k loan to pay off remaining student loans...

a) save myself from a document processing company just in the nick of time

c) get started on rehabbing my (massive, private grad school) debt. 

I had no idea about any of this. I spent the last three years believing I was never going to be able to get my life back together after some very big, bad life decisions.

t3_ga9vqa,StudentLoans,PAYE: Spousal Relation to Payments,"Hi all. I have a question regarding PAYE. I've read that with PAYE, if you file your taxes separately from your spouse, their income doesn't count towards the discretionary income used to calculate your payment. However, your payment is also determined by how big your household is. So the question is, for PAYE, does tax filing (separate) affect how the household size is determined?","PAYE: Spousal Relation to PaymentsHi all. I have a question regarding PAYE.

t3_ga261l,StudentLoans,Private student loan/bankruptcy,"I have an interesting situation and would like to know if anyone else has run into the same thing. It’s a long story, please bear with me. 

In 2001 I took out a private loan with Sallie Mae for $50k ($25k tuition/$25k living in Seattle) to attend a tech program. My dad and stepmom co-signed, as my credit was not the best. It was a 9 month program and the living money was split into 3 installments, with the tuition paid up front. The school proceeded to file for bankruptcy at the 7 month mark, right before my last disbursement. So all told, the amount borrowed was $42k. 

I was stuck in forbearance for a few years until I got on my feet, then started making payments. The loan was sold to Navient about 10 years in. With all the payments I made, the balance only went down to $32k. During this time, I managed to get my credit in great standing and got my stepmom removed from the loan, but they wouldn’t release my dad. Fast forward to 2019, I had lost my great job, run up debt trying to survive while working multiple jobs, and decided to declare bankruptcy. On my lawyer’s advice, I stopped paying Navient when the case was filed. She said, depending on the trustee, they could ask for the money I paid to Navient back from them to distribute to other creditors. 

I had my hearing in October 2019 and everything went smoothly and went through with no issues. I had kept an eye on my credit report and Navient was listed as on hold pending the hearing. I knew there was a possibility of them going after my dad for the balance. By January 2020, Navient was listed as closed on my credit reports. They did reach out to my dad, but he passed in early January. My stepmom sent them a copy of his death certificate and she hasn’t heard from them since. I finally got the balls to log in to my Navient account this week.... and the loan is gone. Not even the payment history is there. The history only exists on my credit report now. 

Has anyone else had this happen? I haven’t had any contact with the company since I filed for bankruptcy. For the record, I had downloaded an Excel file of my payment history last summer, and to that date I had paid back the principle and $17k in interest. 

TL;DR my private student loan disappeared after I declared bankruptcy.","Private student loan/bankruptcyI have an interesting situation and would like to know if anyone else has run into the same thing. It’s a long story, please bear with me.

t3_ga4k76,StudentLoans,Is there anyway I can pay off my student loan debt for the school of my dreams?,"Hi, I’m a 17 year old senior in hughschool who is accepted to Pace University, the only school i’ve wanted to go to since freshman year. The school normally costs 65-70k. I got a 21,000 scholarship, in addition to a 3.5k room and board scholarship, and an additional 5.8k grant. This brought my yearly total down to $40,920 for Pace. I already plan on working 1-2 jobs during school and getting an apartment with roommates starting sophomore year, which would take my yearly loan down to roughly 25k. I also plan on consolidating/refinancing my loans as soon as possible after college. I cannot take out any parent plus loans, since my parents won’t be supporting me through college. Which means a portion of my loans will have to be taken out in private bank loans. This college is the only college for me (trust me I’ve looked at quite a few) and my major/dream job cannot be done in any other location. I’ll be majoring in arts and entertainment management and interning at companies like ESPN, SONY, ABC, GMA, etc in the heart of New York City during my schooling, which will give me a far better chance of securing a job at these companies. However, student loans scare me to no end, and with a few calculators I’ve used I estimate my interest rate will be 10% with a 10 year payback period.

t3_g9wk5y,StudentLoans,REPAYE vs PAYE questions for married folks with dual income,"Hey there, I will be starting residency this July and really need some advice in exploring student loan repayment options. I have a spouse and she will be making an income as well which complicates my choice of repayment. Below I'll outline my story just so there's a grasp on what it is I'm looking for:

Essentially, I will be 140k (principal 127k) in debt starting residency this july with an average interest rate of 5.9%. Salary for next 4 years starts at 57k then increases by 1k each year. This will most likely quadruple after 4 years to 250k-300k as an attending salary. My wife, whom I just recently married last month, is studying to be a dietitian and she will complete her internship and start full time around July 2021 making around 50k. She has been working part time, made 20k in 2019, and will make around 10k in 2020. She will have about 54k in loans at a 6.0% interest rate by the time she finishes her internship.

My long term goal is to work in an opioid treatment program, of which NHSC is providing up to 75k in student relief in exchange for 3 years of working there. Because of this and the fact that my loan isn't too hefty, PSLF isn't a big concern to me. My plan was to do REPAYE in residency to take advantage of the interest subsidy, and refinance after residency to avoid the no cap on monthly payments REPAYE has put in place (I'd like to save up for a house, support family, invest retirement rather than put more money than my liking toward student loans that I can still pay off relatively quickly after refinancing). But....

I've used the loan simulator [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) provided and it says REPAYE is best option in residency. However, the monthly payments on my loan will spike when accounting for her income when she starts full time in July of 2021. **Is REPAYE really the best option for me? Would I be saving money if we filed taxes separately and did PAYE instead? Just not sure which one is better for us in the long run or short term and need some help crunching numbers together. I would greatly appreciate any help at all, I tend to struggle in grasping financial jargon.**

   * Pros and cons of each type
* How a change of payment plans is governed
   * Pros and cons to switching
   * How is the new payment calculated
   * How often can you switch

Current college senior trying to get the loan situation figured out.

I currently have 27k in federal loans in my name and then my parents have about 43k in parent PLUS loans. I was wondering if it was possible to consolidate both the federal loans and the PLUS loans into one loan through the government, not a private company (SoFi, etc). Along with this, if we can consolidate them am I still eligible for public loan forgiveness?

t3_g9uotp,StudentLoans,Clueless First Generation College Freshman. Send Help.," 

Hello everyone,

I have a few questions and I know some of them may seem silly, but as the title suggests, I am a first generation college student trying to figure things on my own and I have no clue who to ask, so here I am on Reddit!

A bit of background information: I am a 21 year old freshmen. I do not qualify for FAFSA/federal loans for personal reasons, so my only option to pay for school is to take out private loans.

Anyways. I was accepted to my state's university. When I found out I was accepted, I got really excited and couldn't wait for Fall, so I made a last minute decision to attend summer semester.... which starts next week. I emailed my university asking if it was too late, and they informed me that (University) does not drop classes for non-payment and that instead I will get a $40 late fee and after 5 weeks I will start getting 1% interest and collection fees for every week that passes by. I can still attend my classes even if my payment does not come in time for the deadline.

So, I know I messed up by not planning ahead and figuring stuff out. Again, I have no idea how any of this works and I'm completely on my own for this. My question is, when should I take out a loan and how much? Or should I just take out one loan for the entire four years I will be in University?

So sorry for the silly questions and sorry for any grammar errors English is my second language! Any help would be appreciated, thank you so much. :)","Clueless First Generation College Freshman. Send Help.

t3_g9kek0,StudentLoans,Is now a good time to transfer to FedLoan for PSLF?,"So I have one consolidated loan that has been on REPAYE with Great Lakes for almost 2 years while working for a qualifying employer. I have not submitted my first ECF to trigger the transfer from Great Lakes to FedLoan because so far I’ve had a good experience with Great Lakes and why change a good thing?

The CARES act got me thinking it may be a good time to transfer my loans to FedLoan to take advantage of the administrative forbearance our loans are in right now anyways. Great Lakes told me the other day that at the end of the CARES act it’s going to take 30-45 days to issue our first payment due date, so even though CARES ends Sept 30, our first payment won’t actually be due till sometime in November, effectively making us miss one qualifying payment, pushing the forgiveness date out one month. This is apparently standard when leaving any type of forbearance. 

My understanding is when transferring to Fed Loan, there may also be a delay in getting your payment set up right away and therefore making you miss a month and push your forgiveness date out again. Because our loans are qualifying for PSLF right now due to the CARES act, seems like the perfect time to transfer and eat the one month missed payment at the end of CARES instead of two, one at the end of CARES and then another down the road when I transfer to Fed Loan.

i had to file forebearance frequently due to life circumstances (original grant: $16k). obviously i have accrued a lot of capitalized interest, so i haven’t even touched my principle with the payments i have made. my DTI ratio on my credit report is well over 100% now, and since my partner and i want to purchase a house in the next 2-3 yrs, i have to clean that up. (i have 0 other debt, personal loans or collections.) 

come mid september, my plan is to pay off the current interest accrued on these 3 fed loans through navient ($5,296) and potentially do a direct loan consolidation. 
would that help my DTI ratio by resetting my loan repayment? i believe i’d get a 6.15% weighted interest rate using my current rates, so it’s not a huge loss (to me; am i wrong?) i want to get these paid off in 5 years max. 

1. original loan: $5,500. now total is $8,633 (subsidized) 
- [ interest: $1,559 (to be paid off 9/25)]
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,074 @ 5.6% int

2. original loan: $5,500. now total is $8,889 (subsidized)
- [ interest: $1,698 (to be paid off 9/25) ]
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,191 @ 6% int

3. original loan: $5,000. now total is $9,656 (FFEL unsubsidized) 
- [ interest $2,039 (to be paid off 9/25) ] 
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,617 @ 6.8% int 

total principle: $21,882 

TLDR: is direct consolidation for a former serial federal loan forebearancer a good idea, or should i just stick to my existing navient/dept of ed loan terms (payment until 2030 as the plan stands)? is there even a point? i’m not looking to refinance to a private loan. 

i’ve seen people get some really good financial advice here, so i figured i’d shoot my shot and see if anyone’s had a similar situation, or knows what i should do for mine. 

thanks for reading and be well, everyone","hey student loan gurus, i need some advice about how to handle 3 fed loansi was an a-hole and haven’t paid on 3 of my student loans in... years. my credit already blows because of that, so i get it. i’m trying to fix the mess.

t3_g9a1u4,StudentLoans,Should I continue paying during COVID deferral?,"I have just under 26k of student debt remaining all fed government owned loans. The average interest rate is just North of 5 percent. 3.1k is at 6.8%. My monthly minimum is 526. If I eliminate the 6.8% debt  which is across three loans, my new monthly minimum will be 441 or an 85 savings each month.

My plan was to continue paying 525 over the next 6 months of deferal and Target the 6.8% loans to wipe them out and reduce the monthly minimum when we are on the other side of the COVID deferral.

Where I am struggling is I know it is not advised to prepay interest free debt which this essentially is right now. However in my view it's only a matter of time until that interest clock starts again. Also I know I could pay a lump sum of the 3.1k right before the defferal period ends for the same result but that is just a harder cash flow pill to swallow pyschologically I suppose.

My other debts are an auto loan at 3% and mortgage at 4.75%.  I already have an emergency fund saved and would be able to pay this down out of operational cash flow pending nothing happens to my employment in the foreseeable future.

t3_g966it,StudentLoans,COVID Cost me income; Need additional loan for rent,"For background, I am currently a law student and took out the Stafford loan and GradPLUS loans to cover my tuition and cost of living for this school year. I only took out enough to cover up until I started working this summer. I did not use my parents as cosigners. Unfortunately, because of COVID, my clerkship has been postponed and as a result I cannot cover rent for this summer yet. My parents advised that I take out another private loan to cover rent, which makes sense to me. They are unwilling to lend me money as they are planning for retirement and my father lost his job as a result of this a few years ahead of schedule. While we are not in dire straights, it is apparent that beyond cosigning, I am on my own. 

With a cosigner, I easily get approved for a loan for the summer term from private lenders (So far only looked at Sallie Mae). The issue is, I am not taking summer classes. The student loan is approved subject to pending approval from my school. I am worried that the school will not approve the loan because it is not covering school tuition, rather, it is covering living expenses. Additionally, am I exposed to some sort of liability for taking a school loan and not using it for the summer term? I don't want to commit fraud or something in doing so. If this is not an option, please advise what type of loan/lenders should I go to to get a loan to cover my cost of living for (at least) the next 6 months until I can work again.","COVID Cost me income; Need additional loan for rentFor background, I am currently a law student and took out the Stafford loan and GradPLUS loans to cover my tuition and cost of living for this school year.

t3_g8sku5,StudentLoans,Worth Getting out of default? (wife),"Long story short. My wife has about $11k in federal student loans left. She’s been in default and they are taking 15% of her pay.  She makes about 50k a year. I make about 65k.  Everything we own is in my name. House, car, bills etc.

We do file taxes jointly and get our tax refund taken as well.  My question is, is it worth getting out of default?  Would love to get the tax refund next year (at this rate would be paid off in 1-2 years)

We make no payment other than the wage garnishment which is about 200-225 every two weeks.   We do have about 10k worth of CC debt we need to get taken care of. (At least will be taken care of due to no garnishment currently)

Should we do a rehabilitation to get out of default?  Will they include my income when looking at how much we agree to pay per month?  and continue to garnish (after sept?)?

If we don’t get out of default, will that eventually go away on her record?  It’s currently not on credit reports but the loans left are definitely in default.  We plan on buying a new forever home in 3-5 years and would like to have her be on the mortgage to get approved.","Worth Getting out of default? (wife)Long story short.

Currently, my state and federal tax refunds are being redirected to pay my loan off. I was fine with it at first because my refunds weren't that much. Now I am making a lot more money and would rather pay a monthly to the loan rather than lose my tax refunds. Plus I think this would be the time to renegotiate.

My question is if I start paying off my student loan, will they stop taking my refund? If so, how do I go about doing that?

I'm looking for people who've been through this or know what I am talking about and not people who ""guess"" how to do this.

EDIT: I can't help but to see the irony in that some people are asking how can someone with a degree not understand how tax refunds work, but they lacked reading skills. My debt came from grad school. Stuff happened that affected my finances and paying off a student loan was not a priority especially when they had the wrong amount. That was five years ago.

I am making more money now and would rather pay a small monthly amount, write off the tax interest and keep my tax refunds which are going to be sizable. This has nothing to do with tax refund common sense. This has to do with managing the bureaucracy.

t3_g7zyxv,StudentLoans,Wages Being Garnished - Best Way to get out of Default?,"Hello, 

Obligatory notice that I'm a dumbass for not dealing with this earlier. 

With collection fees, I have a 5-6K federal student loan in default with Coast Professionals. I got a notice in the mail in February about wage garnishment. I spoke to someone previously about the loan rehabilitation process, but there was a section I wasn't sure how to fill out. I tried to get in contact with Coast Professional several times for help filling out the form, but this is when the Coronavirus hit. I couldn't get through when I called. Sometimes I went straight through to voicemail which prompted me to leave my contact information, saying someone would get back with me, but they never did. 

I started making monthly payments of around $250 or so through the [myeddebt.ed.gov](https://myeddebt.ed.gov) website a few months ago. I just filed 2018 and 2019 taxes a few weeks ago, and I noticed that my wages were being garnished in the [mydebt.ed.gov](https://mydebt.ed.gov) website ($700-800/month!). There were garnishments listed for February, March, and April, but no money had been taken out of my paycheck, according to my bank account. 

I  know my options are consolidation, rehabilitation, or payment in full. I only have one loan so I don't know if consolidation makes sense, and I think I can pay the loan off faster than the 9-10 months that it would take to rehab. Plus, when I called Coast Professional before, they were pretty dodgy about the rehabilitation process. We could probably afford to pay in full but I'm nervous to have less of an emergency fund in case my wife gets furloughed due to the Coronavirus.

Is there any way to stop the wage garnishment? I plan on calling them ASAP, but I'm not sure what my best option is. I'm eager to set up a plan. Thanks for your help; I know it's not a large loan, but I'm still really freaked out.","Wages Being Garnished - Best Way to get out of Default?Hello,

t3_g7pmt0,StudentLoans,Is the degree really worth it? Need some advice,"Hey everyone, would really appreciate your help and advice!

I just recently got accepted into UC Berkeley and UCLA as a transfer student!! My major at UC Berkeley is Society &amp; Environment and it's Geography/Environmental Studies at UCLA.

Here's the thing though, I applied honestly thinking I wouldn't get in and never thought this far ahead. I missed the deadline for Cal Grant because I forgot I even applied and I was planning on taking a gap year since I already finished all my general ed classes. 

I applied for these majors because I'm passionate about sustainability and the environment; I don't know why but it just felt right to pursue it as a major. But I don't know what careers I would even be able to get with these degrees. I don't know if I want to take out $70,000 in loans for a bachelors, esp since I'm not even sure what career I want to pursue. 

I've been at a community college for two years so I didn't have to deal with any loans, and I was in a program that covered the cost of my classes. I know nothing about loans to be quite honest. The net costs for a year is $35,140 and I'll be attending for two years. My EFC is ~8700 if that matters. My parents claim me as a dependent but they're not contributing to my education and I fully support myself, although currently I have no income because y'know, pandemic. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it extremely hard to declare myself as an independent? (I'm 20).

Is it really worth it to take out that much in loans for an undergraduate degree I'm unsure about? Please lend me some wisdom, I feel so defeated right now. I want to go to these schools, it's an amazing opportunity I've been handed that I know I'll regret if I don't go, but what if I go and regret it?","Is the degree really worth it?

t3_g7bc71,StudentLoans,"Is now the perfect time to ramp up 401k contributions, no 10% penalty, income based loans - lower agi, delayed taxes","So I heard due to Coronavirus the fed has removed the 10% penalty on removing funds.  I'm currently on an income based student loan plan REPAYE.

I didn't plan to contribute much to my 401k this year since I'm poor but now I'm thinking I can lower my student loan monthly payments and get a 3 year deferment on my taxes.  Would this plan work?

Contribute paycheck company max to 401k plan 75%.

Cap 401k limits 19k I believe over the next few months.

Withdraw contributed funds once 401k annual max is hit with no 10% early removal penalty and gain the ability to repay the income tax over the next 3 years.  This is turn reduces my AGI 19k thereby reducing my income based student loans in the future and it lets me pay back the income tax over the next 3 years whereas If I took normal paycheck contributions, it would be due immediately.

This seems like a win from all angles.

1. Lowers my monthly income based student loan payments in the future since I'm going for forgiveness.
2. Gives me a 3 year loan on my income taxes on the monies deposited into my 401k since the tax can be paid back over 3 years.

I am a fourth-year medical student going into anesthesiology with 147K school debt. I am trying to choose between PAYE vs REPAYE loan programs. I can't find an answer anywhere to what exactly happens when you no longer qualify for PAYE. I understand that 10% of your original principal interest (14.7K in my case) capitalizes. Does the rest of your interest stay as it is or does it go away? 

Also, apparently, after PAYE, you never pay more than what you would pay under a 10-year standard repayment plan. Is the principal amount used in this case to calculate your monthly payments is the original amount or the new amount after capitalization (14.7K + 147K in my case)? 

My another question is what is the income cut-off for you to no longer qualify for PAYE?

Finally, for someone who wants to refinance loans later, is REPAYE a better option because of the interest forgiven during residency?

t3_g7g2xs,StudentLoans,Undergrad Financial Aid,"I am not sure if this is a unique situation, but could not really find anything from a google or Reddit search:

I decided to go back to school this spring and finish my undergrad. I enrolled at a local/online school, and plan to graduate this December. I applied for financial aid and took out a subsidized loan. Now that I am in the swing of things and figured out how to balance school and my FT job, I decided I am going to continue and get my MBA/M.S. (different institution). I have one random UL elective to finish, which led to what I though was a good idea: I am going to take a grad course and have that fill my last elective while already starting to work on my grad degree. Since I am not considered an official grad student yet, I was told not to apply for financial aid through graduate school.

My questions is, for my 20-21 FAFSA, can I take out subsidized/unsubsidized loan and use that to pay for grad courses? I also received two checks for my spring semester, since it was in excess of my course cost (I know some people use these for books, supplies, housing, etc.). I assumed the correct thing to do with the excess is just to pay down the balance...but I wasn't sure if I could use that or additional financial aid to pay for my grad courses. From what I researched, the have a different interest rate. So I wouldn't want to be dishonest about that. 

Any feedback would be great. I would rather not have to pay out of pocket for my first two courses, as the grad school cost per credit is much greater then what I am paying for undergrad.","Undergrad Financial AidI am not sure if this is a unique situation, but could not really find anything from a google or Reddit search:

t3_g6y9hg,StudentLoans,What loan repayment plan would you pick?,"Hi, I'm a graduating medical student faced with the decision of what loan repayment plan to pick (REPAYE, PAYE, IBR) and I'm pretty lost.

I have 169,000 of debt (all direct stafford loans at 5.3-6.6% interest rates) with about 10,000 in interest so far. My interest will capitalize in September when I pick my repayment plan, but I shouldn't collect more until then because of the CARES act w/ covid.

I'm looking at a 3 year residency making 66-68,000 a year. Then I'll go to fellowship for 3 more years and make about the same amount. I expect I'll move into an academic hospitalist position after fellowship (so six years from now) and make around 150,000.

Here is where I get confused. I'm looking at getting married in 3 years. My partner would likely be making 120,000 at that time and he has no debt. He doesn't feel responsible for my medical school debt and isn't sure he wants to contribute to my loan payoff. Fine, and honestly fair, it is my debt. The problem is his income will be included in my REPAYE AGI calculation and in my PAYE if we don't file taxes separately. I don't know how to predict how filing separately would impact our taxes and if that would make the difference with PAYE even worth it. I'm considering PSLF, which would make REPAYE with the payment cap important given our income differential, but I'm not sure it will even be around when it comes time for me. Making those low payments would massively balloon my debt if I went that route and was wrong.

t3_g70b2w,StudentLoans,Loan Servicing Cost - Stafford to Direct Consolidation Considerations,"So I'm not sure if anyone can answer this but I am wondering what it costs a company to service a loan. Does it depend on the balance/monthly payment or is there a ""floor"" or fixed cost that it will never be lower than to generate statements and what not.   


I am wondering because When I first graduated in 2007 I had about seven Stafford FEEL loans totaling about $20,000. I threw any extra money I had at my student loans and often ended up sacrificing something to do so. I told the servicing company to put the extra at principal and NOT to pay ahead, BUT they payed it ahead anyway. I didn't find this out until years later when it showed almost a full year of payed ahead status. Shortly after finding this out they sold my loan to Great Lakes so there wasn't much to do about it. Well the years went by with Great Lakes until they themselves resold my loan back to my original servicer.  


I am now considering consolidating six of the remaining Stafford loans to a Consolidated Direct loan. I owe about $7,000 and the APR's on the loans are 6.8, 6.55, 4.66, 4.66, 4.66 and 4.66. One of the 4.66% loans only has a balance of $229 left. Basically I am wondering the cost to the company to service that $229 with a $3 monthly payment for the full remaining eight years. By leaving this loan out of my consolidation I will be paying a higher interest rate since Direct consolidation loans get their interest rate by averaging the rates of all the loans. so my new APR will suffer slightly with one less 4.66% loan to add in.  If I calculated correctly it would mean a rate of 5.46 instead of 5.33 so this slightly higher rate will cost me about $10 a year extra just to keep the tiny loan out of the consolidation.   


As I understand it servicers only get about half of a percent of the monthly payment they process so they would get about 15 cents a month in revenue off my loan. If the cost to service a loan has a fixed ""floor"" and that cost is say $4 or $5 I would say it might be worth spending $10 a year to make me feel better about them stealing all that money in extra interest from me back in 2007/2008 by paying ahead and not extra towards the principal, but if that cost to them is only a $1 a month it prob isn't worth the cost. Anyone know how to find out?

I am now considering consolidating six of the remaining Stafford loans to a Consolidated Direct loan. I owe about $7,000 and the APR's on the loans are 6.8, 6.55, 4.66, 4.66, 4.66 and 4.66. One of the 4.66% loans only has a balance of $229 left. Basically I am wondering the cost to the company to service that $229 with a $3 monthly payment for the full remaining eight years. By leaving this loan out of my consolidation I will be paying a higher interest rate since Direct consolidation loans get their interest rate by averaging the rates of all the loans. so my new APR will suffer slightly with one less 4.66% loan to add in.  If I calculated correctly it would mean a rate of 5.46 instead of 5.33 so this slightly higher rate will cost me about $10 a year extra just to keep the tiny loan out of the consolidation.   


As I understand it servicers only get about half of a percent of the monthly payment they process so they would get about 15 cents a month in revenue off my loan. If the cost to service a loan has a fixed ""floor"" and that cost is say $4 or $5 I would say it might be worth spending $10 a year to make me feel better about them stealing all that money in extra interest from me back in 2007/2008 by paying ahead and not extra towards the principal, but if that cost to them is only a $1 a month it prob isn't worth the cost. Anyone know how to find out? Thanks for any help you can provide.",1,loan servicing cost direct sure anyone answer cost company service loan balance monthly payment floor cost never lower generate statement first seven feel loan totaling threw extra money loan often sacrificing something servicing company put extra principal pay anyway year later almost full year status shortly loan great lake much well year went great lake loan back original servicer six remaining loan direct loan owe apr loan one loan balance left basically cost company service monthly payment full remaining eight year leaving loan paying higher interest rate since direct loan interest rate averaging rate loan new apr suffer slightly one le loan correctly mean rate slightly higher rate cost year extra keep tiny loan servicers half percent monthly payment process cent month revenue loan cost service loan floor cost say say might worth year feel better stealing money extra interest back paying extra principal cost month prob worth cost anyone thanks help
t3_g6z8nq,StudentLoans,Entrance Loan Counseling,"Hey all,

I am planning to start my Masters in the Summer semester here in a few weeks but needed to complete an MPN and Entrance Loan Counseling. I signed the MPN and completed the Entrance Loan Counseling but the way I was understanding the ELC form was to be on a purely informative basis and not something treated as an official form to base any loans or repayment off of. I left some numbers like estimated housing costs provided by the school unchanged so when I got to the end and submitted it popped up with a summary page where it stated something along the lines that the information I provided will be reported to my loan servicer. I wanted to ask if I need to complete another form and ensure every number is accurate as it also had me estimate what I expect to make after I finish my degree and the typical salary is $60k in the ideal job that I am aiming for so I put that but it also started basing repayment numbers off of that and I've had at most a $30k salary in the past. 

Questions: Should I resubmit another one? Call my school to explain numbers since the form is being sent to them? Is the form purely an informative one for the one completing?","Entrance Loan CounselingHey all,

t3_g6e05a,StudentLoans,"$92,500 in loans, still have 1 more year of college need advice","Hey everybody, I'm in need of advice

I currently have $92,500 in loans, and I don't know how to pay for my last year of college.

I also have a plan for what to do after graduating, and wanted to hear opinions on it

I'm currently finishing up my junior year of college, and I don't know how I want to pay for my senior year.  I, like many other kids, stupidly took out expensive loans so I could go to an out-of-state college, and even though I am getting a good degree (Mechanical Engineering), I still regret the amount of debt I have put myself into just for an education.  I wish I had spent my first 1.5 - 2 years at commumity college so I could save a lot of money, but it's too late for that now.  It only recently just hit me just how much debt I'm in, and I'm really sad and scared about it and what to do. 

Here are my current loans:

Private loans: (Only paying interest while still in school)

$35,000 5.19% 15 year

$38,000 5.6 % 15 year

Federal sub/undsub loans: 

$19,500 \~4.5%

My last year of college will be \~$35,000, minus the federal loans ($7,500) I accept  for the 2020-2021 school year, so that means I still have to come up with around $27,500 for my senior year.  Should I take out another loan? I can't take a year off school to work and save money to pay for my senior year because I will have to start making full payments on my existing loans and won't be able to save enough.  I really don't want to go over 100k in student loan debt, but it looks like that is the only option to be able to graduate.

My father has told me not to be scared about this, and he says when I graduate I can still live home rent free, and he will help pay a little bit each month.  I know for mechanical engineers the starting salarying ranges from 60-65k a year, and since I am close to NYC I know that starting salaries are closer to \~70k.  My first engineering intership I had was in NYC, so I am used to the travel there for work.  Since my only debt is my loans, my father told me I can make double and triple payments on my private loans the first \~2-3 years, and that will lower them a substatial amount, especially if I get a good entry level job.  At the moment, I'm not very worried about paying off my federal loans faster than my private loans, because the interest rates are lower.  With my private loans, I have calculated that if I make double payments on my private loans they will be paid in about 5.5 years opposed to 15 years, and I will save &gt;$22,000 in interest. If I make a little more money I could pay even more than double payments too and pay them off even faster. 

To Summarize:

\-I still need to pay for my last year of college and I really don't want to go further into debt, so I am hesitant about getting another loan, but it looks like its the only choice.  (Go from 92.5k total in loans right now to \~128k total after graduating)

\-To deal with my loans, my plan is after I graduate I hope to find a good job in NYC while living with my parents. They said they wouldn't charge me anything for rent or food, and I will be able to put most of my salary into my private loans through double or more payments since I have no other debt, and I will likely just pay the minimum on my federal loans unless I can pay more since they are low interest.","$92,500 in loans, still have 1 more year of college need adviceHey everybody, I'm in need of advice

Here’s my scenario: I got into Vassar, and I’ve fallen in love. I’ve made some connections with other admits, and I know that the alumni network is amazing. It’s relatively easy to get internships in the city. There is an open curriculum and I am thinking pre-law, but I’m not sure, and I know this would benefit me immensely. It is all undergrad, meaning tons of opportunity for research and exploration, and even a 300 acre preserve and farm on campus for research opportunity. That said, costs are around 75,000 and I would have to pay about 63,000 per year, which includes a small subsidized loan of 3000. My family has said they would help me pay about 40,000 per year, but they would have to take out loans to do it. I feel like they would be able to pay about 2 years, but struggle with the other two. They’re not 100% open. The rest is on me. That’s about 92,000 in total for me if my financial appeal doesn’t come through. I don’t want to be a burden, but this is an amazing opportunity. I’ve also had an absolutely horrible experience in high school because my peers are mostly unmotivated and lazy, and I want to be in an institution that fosters creativity with people who love learning. I CANNOT settle for a school because high school was bad enough. 

That being said, I got a full ride to St Johns University, but I really hate that school because of the sheer amount of requirements in the curriculum. I’ll never explore anything. I would be paying 5000 for SUNY Stony Brook, it’s fine but huge and not ideal. I also got 32,500 in scholarship for Fordham, but Fordham is 72,000 anyway. The location for Fordham is a draw, as is the alumni network. But I would still have to take out loans and at that point, is it worth it if I choose Vassar instead? Also I’m in the honors program for Stony and St Johns.

I’m planning to get a job out of college to help me fund grad school. I’m thinking of law but am not certain. I want to be in the best position possible to be successful, and I know Vassar’s alumni and name can help. I’m just so stressed about the finances, and my family has expressed that they cannot pay unless I take out the loans in my name. I’m also trying to apply to scholarships, so I may get some money.

That being said, I got a full ride to St Johns University, but I really hate that school because of the sheer amount of requirements in the curriculum. I’ll never explore anything. I would be paying 5000 for SUNY Stony Brook, it’s fine but huge and not ideal. I also got 32,500 in scholarship for Fordham, but Fordham is 72,000 anyway. The location for Fordham is a draw, as is the alumni network. But I would still have to take out loans and at that point, is it worth it if I choose Vassar instead? Also I’m in the honors program for Stony and St Johns.

I’m planning to get a job out of college to help me fund grad school. I’m thinking of law but am not certain. I want to be in the best position possible to be successful, and I know Vassar’s alumni and name can help. I’m just so stressed about the finances, and my family has expressed that they cannot pay unless I take out the loans in my name. I’m also trying to apply to scholarships, so I may get some money.

t3_g6bewu,StudentLoans,grad school - unsubsidized student loan vs personal loan,"I got into some of the best schools for what I plan to study, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity. 

Unfortunately, for my top choices, I could not find a single company that would offer student loan. The schools are in scandinavia, and for whatever reason, no one, including Salle Mae, would provide loan. The only option is personal loan for those schools. 

I also got accepted at McGill, and luckily, I can apply for the US federal unsubsidized student loan.

&amp;#x200B;

If I understand correctly, the major difference between unsubsidized student loan versus a personal loan is simply ""start pay now"" vs ""start pay once you are done with school"". Either way, it will still pile up  interest over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, it's better to start paying as soon as I can to reduce the amount of interest. On the other hand, it will be very difficult to pay monthly payment while being a full time student. I plan on getting a decent part time job, but I don;t know how successful I'll be with that in a foreign country. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is the only reason to go for unsubsidized student loan simply the ability to postpone payment?","grad school - unsubsidized student loan vs personal loanI got into some of the best schools for what I plan to study, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity.

t3_g63kbj,StudentLoans,Variable Interest Rate Riskiness?,"I'm currently a student earning my Master's in Reading Education. I have four courses remaining, and due to the pandemic, I wanted to finish them up during the summer. However, I just realized today that I can't apply my 2020-2021 student loan offer to this summer. I currently have $30k in student loans from undergrad and grad school.

If I finish in the summer, I'll be able to earn my Master's pay this current school year ($74,616 from $67,813). If I finish in the fall, my new pay will be applied in the 2021-2022 school year. If I wait until the fall semester, I can get the federal loan interest rate in September. It'll just be more difficult while teaching than it will be during the summer. The summer courses are also shorter. 

The total cost is $9080. At the end of this school year, I am getting $1125 reimbursed from my school district, bringing the cost down to $7,995.

Because I have no financial aid options for the summer, I was looking at private loans. Sally Mae has an offer for a fixed rate loan for 5.750% with interest payments in the beginning and principle payments later. It's fixed rate option is 8.1250%.

I know that variable interest rates are often risky. How risky are they right now? I figure I'm also going to refinance all my loans once I'm all done. So is it that risky? Any other advice for means of acquiring the funds?

*Edit: I called the office of financial aid again and asked about increasing my borrowing limit as per u/horsebycommittee's advice. She directed me to a Summer Aid form from which the balance of the original amount offered to me would become available. Looks like the problem is solved as long as they approve it.

t3_g65jtn,StudentLoans,Targeted Payments - Covid Deferral Period,"  

Since we are currently not obligated to make payments on our student loans, I recently attempted to make targeted payments only to the student loan with the highest interest rate. Cornerstone is my provider and during my first attempt I went through their online portal and entered my bank information. After a week or so, I noticed they never withdrew the money from my account. I followed up with them and they stated the bank information was inaccurate. This was the same bank information they have been automatically deducting payments from for years. During this call, I ask the Customer Service Rep to initiate they payments on their end. They requested my bank information and I relayed this information from a physical check that was right in front of me. The initial payment said processed and when I looked at my bank it was never withdrawn. Ultimately the funds were never withdrawn and I was unable to make the payment to the specific higher interest loan. 

I called them today to confirm why it didn't go through and they said the bank did not have any information with my account information. I immediately called my bank and they (1) confirmed the information I provided to Cornerstone was accurate and (2) that they never attempted to deduct the funds from account.

Has anyone had this issue? I want to use this time as an opportunity to pay down the higher interest loan but I can't help but think something shady is going on.","Targeted Payments - Covid Deferral Period

When I graduated from college back in 2008 my loans totaled to $120,000. Due to recession in 08 I had a hard time finding a job in my field and had to defer loans for a year. Over the years I struggled to make the payments I contacted Sallie Mae and they screwed me. I didnt realize at the time but they extended my loan to 25 years with a variable interest rate. So now I have been paying around $1200 a month for the longest time and it seems like I am barely making a dent. Considering I have been out of school for so long.

I was considering refinancing, but was worried that would disqualify me from any future loan forgiveness. Also my college was sued for defraudulent practices so I do have a claim for forgiveness that is not being processed by the current administration. So I am not sure refinancing is the right move right now, but some of my loans are rocking a 8% interest rate. I have made a few larger payments recently to navient and I am confused on how they are allocating my payments. Sometimes it seems they are going to unpaid interest, sometime interest, sometimes principal amount. I attempted to pay off all the unpaid interest so I made over payments for the unpaid totals but checked today and those payments didnt all go to the interest so I am at a loss for what is going on.

I recently refinanced my 55k in private loans with Earnest at 4.26%. I also have about 45k in federal loans of both subsidized and unsubsidized ranging from 3ish to 5ish%. (I also have 12k in Perkins loans that I can get cancelled after 5 years of working as a nurse.)

Question: My minimum payment with Earnest is $735/mo. Payments with federal are $0/mo for this year (since I made no money last year in school). Should I just continue to throw my money (above my minimum) at the private loans in the meantime since my federal loans aren't accruing interest?

t3_g5kicr,StudentLoans,"About to start a DPT program with quite a bit of loan, any advice would be appreciated!","Hello everyone! Hope everyone is staying safe in this time.

I’m about to start a DPT program (3years including summer) in fall 2020 with a good amount of debt and I was wondering if anyone have any advice on how to have a right mindset or how to start preparing to pay for them.

Thankfully I can cover the full tuition and cost of living with just federal loans (unsubsidized and grad plus loans). I’m estimating to have 176K before the interst for this 3 years program.

I know the debt will be high once I graduate and I’m definitely going to try to work for a non-profit hospital (for PSLF) or become a traveling PT (pays higher)to pay the loan as fast as possible. But every time I look at how much I will be in debt once I graduate is pretty scary and depressing.

t3_g5ky60,StudentLoans,Pre-planning for student loans. I really need help before signing away my soul.,"I'll be going to law school next year. I already work in law, so I know what I'm getting myself into as a career. I know it most likely won't make a lot of money, but it's something I actually enjoy and would like to make a career out of. It's where my passion lies...unfortunately, because if my passion was within engineering, money would be far less of a fear.  
That said, student loans. No matter what school I go to, I'll need to take some out if only to cover the living expenses. I've calculated around 80k for 3 years at a school where I have full tuition if I can't get any work during those 3 years, but employment rate upon graduation at that school is quite low. I have a few choices for schools, but I'm trying to figure out the feasibility of survival after taking out the loans.  
I've been trying to run the numbers, but I have no experience in budgeting or finance.  
I've run the numbers through some separate calculators, but I know the numbers can't be correct. Otherwise, everyone would be taking out loans as no big deal.  
Here's what I'm getting: If I take out $180,000 in loans over 3 years, then graduate with a job paying $60,000 (about the median amount attorneys make if you get rid of the outliers), then using [MIT's living wage calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06037) for Los Angeles, the cost of living would be 26,528, income tax based on [smartasset's calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) would be around 16000, and monthly loan payments based on [studentaid.gov's calculator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator) would be from 344-483/month if my income grows by 2% annually. This would, if assuming the $483 payment as a constant, theoretically leave me with around 11000/year left over to pocket. If 10% of wages should go into retirement savings, that still leaves 5k/year. It's been pointed out to me in /r/personalfinance that mit's living wage calculator is likely a gross underestimation of living expenses. According to the [census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/losangelescountycalifornia) website, the median income for LA is around 64k/year, though 14.2% of people live in poverty.  
All of my loans will be federal loans because I'm ""lucky"" enough to be broke enough to qualify for entirely federal to cover all expenses. But the 60k/year income is more of a median estimate, so there's a chance that I'd either make significantly less, or even be unable to find employment, or significantly more, around 180k/year (around 40% of graduates from that school made 180k/year in the first year's salary).  
A lot of this planning hinges on loan forgiveness after 20 years if I can't get a high paying job after graduation. Financial aid offices tout this as a viable option, but how viable is it really?  
No matter where I go, I'll end up with somewhere between 80k-180k in student loans, and the more loans I take out, the higher the probability of getting the job that will allow me to pay off those loans...but there's still a chance that no matter where I go, I won't get a job anywhere, and I'll still end up owing a lot of money. That's the double edge sword. A piece of me thinks ""80k debt with no job...well, what's the difference between 80k debt with no job and 180k debt with no job, that debt will still be impossible to pay off either way.""  
Financial aid offices at schools are very biased, as are the government websites that give you the loans in the first place, so I'd like as much information as possible about pre-budgeting, paying off student loans in the future, etc.  
I'm also aware of PSLF, and would like to keep that open as an option, but I know I can't depend on it because it could be taken away at any point.","Pre-planning for student loans.

t3_g54dln,StudentLoans,Federal Student Loans Repayment Schedule/Redisclosure Questions (general &amp; COVID Qs),"**Summary:**

1. Did my servicer calculate my repayment schedule wrong? Is it too late to do anything after 6 years? 
2. Will servicers redisclose the loans (recalibrate payment schedules) after COVID forbearance?
3. If I'm paid ahead slightly, and my loans are redisclosed, will my monthly payment go up or down? 

**Background**  
I finished grad school in 2014 with $16K in undergraduate debt and $121K in grad school debt (total $137K). This was a breakdown of my loans (including the uncapitalized accumulated interest):

|FFEL (3 loans cumulative)|$16,000 |
|:-|:-|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$15,023|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$14,200|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$22,600|
|Direct PLUS|$6,000|
|Direct PLUS|$11,200|
|Direct PLUS|$34,764|

I did not consolidate the loans. Extended Graduated Repayment worked best for my situation and I was given a 20 year repayment schedule (240 months). I know the FFEL loans were only eligible for 10 yr repayment.

After 17 payments, my servicer redisclosed my repayment schedule, and the repayment schedule was 240 months again.

I was recently reading that a borrower can have up to 25 years (300 months) for repayment under Extended Repayment. Was my $121K in Direct loans only enough for a 20 year repayment schedule? Is it too late to do anything at this point?

Through lots of hard work, I have knocked down my debt to about $80K.  Also, I am paid ahead by a 3-5 months on my remaining loans.  Does anyone know if after COVID forbearance, will the servicers be redisclosing the repayment schedule? If I'm paid ahead, will the payment go down slightly?","Federal Student Loans Repayment Schedule/Redisclosure Questions (general &amp; COVID Qs)**Summary:**

3. If I'm paid ahead slightly, and my loans are redisclosed, will my monthly payment go up or down? 

**Background**  
I finished grad school in 2014 with $16K in undergraduate debt and $121K in grad school debt (total $137K). This was a breakdown of my loans (including the uncapitalized accumulated interest):

|FFEL (3 loans cumulative)|$16,000 |
|:-|:-|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$15,023|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$14,200|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$22,600|
|Direct PLUS|$6,000|
|Direct PLUS|$11,200|
|Direct PLUS|$34,764|

I did not consolidate the loans. Extended Graduated Repayment worked best for my situation and I was given a 20 year repayment schedule (240 months). I know the FFEL loans were only eligible for 10 yr repayment.

After 17 payments, my servicer redisclosed my repayment schedule, and the repayment schedule was 240 months again.

I was recently reading that a borrower can have up to 25 years (300 months) for repayment under Extended Repayment. Was my $121K in Direct loans only enough for a 20 year repayment schedule? Is it too late to do anything at this point?

Through lots of hard work, I have knocked down my debt to about $80K.  Also, I am paid ahead by a 3-5 months on my remaining loans.  Does anyone know if after COVID forbearance, will the servicers be redisclosing the repayment schedule? If I'm paid ahead, will the payment go down slightly?",1,loan repayment question general covid q summary servicer calculate repayment wrong late anything year servicers loan recalibrate payment covid forbearance slightly loan monthly payment school k k school total k loan interest ffel loan cumulative direct direct direct direct direct direct plus direct plus direct plus loan repayment best situation given year repayment month ffel loan eligible yr repayment payment servicer repayment repayment month recently borrower year month repayment repayment k direct loan enough year repayment late anything point lot work k month remaining loan anyone covid forbearance servicers repayment payment slightly

t3_g56ijb,StudentLoans,18 and need loan advice,"Hello!

I was recently admitted to my dream school, UC Santa Barbara, but I am not in good standing relationship with either of my parents and they are infuriated with my decision to go to a univeristy (they want me to work just like them, and not actually attend college), as well as the idea of taking out a loan to attend, despite the fact that I have gotten straight A's throughout high school. I am very scared that I wont be able to attend due to the fact that my parents will not cosign any sort of private loan that I would need in order to attend. I am currently very behind on many things, as I turned 18 a few months ago and do not even having a checking or credit account with the bank. Currently, I would need to take out $27,000 in loans for one year at this school, but I do not know how to do this without my parent's help, and they refuse to offer any advice or support which is why I have come here for help. My parents make above $80,000 combined so colleges wouldn't be lenient to reducing the tuition for me either. I really want to know what my options are and I hope someone here could help me figure things out. Of course I know I need to go to the bank ASAP and open a credit card up, but is it possible for me to easily take out $27,000 in loans without my parents to cosign? Any advice is greatly appreicated!

TL;DR -- Unsure how to take out $27,000 in student loans as an 18-year old with no parental help, despite the fact that I am still dependent on them. Google confused me on my options so I wondered if anyone here has a clue on what I could do in this situation. FAFSA said I qualified for about 5000 in federal loans.

EDIT: The school says I need to find 19k from private lenders and that I qualify for 8k from college/federal lenders. I can most likely live off campus to reduce this number by a few thousand, probably 3 or 4 thousand. I really am looking for a college experience and memories -- but am unsure if its worth the money. It is my dream school after all!

Thank you!","18 and need loan adviceHello!

t3_g4y3wc,StudentLoans,Confused on what happens after nelnet 6 months no payments.,"I have nelnet and got No payments for 6 months. You will not have to make payments on your federally held student loans for six months (through September 30, 2020).

BUT I cant seem to find any information on what happens after this 6 months is all over. Can someone tell me what I should expect? Which will happen?

1. September will require all 6 months payment at once for the non paid months (so $300x6 = payment of $1800)

2.  Entire loan payoff date gets extended by 6 months and payments stay normal

3. Loan payments are now higher for the rest of the loan term (6 months of payments divided by months left on loan added to each month)

t3_g4w47y,StudentLoans,My bf had no idea he had any loans...thought his parents paid up front...6 loans in default for 3 +years..help,"So obviously my bf made some mistakes in his past. His parents also made several mistakes. Yes, we know this is bad but we need help.   


So, he has 6 student loans from what I can tell that all totaled around 10k ..all six went into default approximately 3  years ago. His parents never told him he had loans..much less that they were going to stop paying them ..so we have sifted through his credit report.    



From what I can tell all six were from department of Ed..in 2018 they were sold back to the federal government? They have all accrued interest and collections charges that bring the grand total now to over $15,000.    


After my research I have done I have decided he should call and ask about rehabilitation ...but I have questions... 


What if he isn’t eligible and the 7yr mark resets on all because he contacted them? Will he immediately have to pay all 15k?   



If he does loan rehab will the interest and collections fees have the option to be waived? He didn’t even get his degree and it is so heartbreaking to pay 5,000 in interest when he is already paying 10k for absolutely nothing.   


If he is able to do rehab will it bring all loans out of default after the ten months of payments?    


His credit is 490 or so...I know it’s going to continue dropping...does this mean that he will always have bad credit?   



My head is spinning. I have student loans too but I got my bachelors and only have 5k in debt that I have been paying on since graduation .   


I am so worried that he is forever screwed. I know it’s not all on his parents but truthfully I completely believe him that his parents never told him anything. He suffered a brain injury as a child and therefore his parents neglect to tell him things about the real world sometimes due to either thinking he’s too stupid to understand or thinking he shouldn’t have to worry about this stuff since they paid for their other children to go to school. I can see on the credit report that his mother paid payments on 3 of the 6 loans for about 2 years before suddenly defaulting on all of them.   


Is rehab the best option? Someone help","My bf had no idea he had any loans...thought his parents paid up front...6 loans in default for 3 +years..helpSo obviously my bf made some mistakes in his past. His parents also made several mistakes. Yes, we know this is bad but we need help.   


So, he has 6 student loans from what I can tell that all totaled around 10k ..all six went into default approximately 3  years ago. His parents never told him he had loans..much less that they were going to stop paying them ..so we have sifted through his credit report.    



From what I can tell all six were from department of Ed..in 2018 they were sold back to the federal government? They have all accrued interest and collections charges that bring the grand total now to over $15,000.    


After my research I have done I have decided he should call and ask about rehabilitation ...but I have questions... 


What if he isn’t eligible and the 7yr mark resets on all because he contacted them? Will he immediately have to pay all 15k?   



If he does loan rehab will the interest and collections fees have the option to be waived? He didn’t even get his degree and it is so heartbreaking to pay 5,000 in interest when he is already paying 10k for absolutely nothing.   


If he is able to do rehab will it bring all loans out of default after the ten months of payments?    


His credit is 490 or so...I know it’s going to continue dropping...does this mean that he will always have bad credit?   



My head is spinning. I have student loans too but I got my bachelors and only have 5k in debt that I have been paying on since graduation .   


I am so worried that he is forever screwed. I know it’s not all on his parents but truthfully I completely believe him that his parents never told him anything. He suffered a brain injury as a child and therefore his parents neglect to tell him things about the real world sometimes due to either thinking he’s too stupid to understand or thinking he shouldn’t have to worry about this stuff since they paid for their other children to go to school. I can see on the credit report that his mother paid payments on 3 of the 6 loans for about 2 years before suddenly defaulting on all of them.

t3_g500mb,StudentLoans,Alternatives to Parent PLUS Loans?,"I'm currently a freshman in college. Because I was a kid (and frankly, I still am), my mother insisted she'd cosign on a Parent PLUS loan with me because she didn't think I could find any lender. However, she made it clear that she was not paying for any of it and that I would have to assume it all under my name upon graduation. 

This said, I have a better understanding of my loans and do NOT want to keep relying on the PLUS loans. The interest is exorbitant. Without having any credit to my name, how do I find a better alternative? I'm expected to pay for all of my debt myself without any family help. I know how unreliable Sallie Mae is. I guess my only option is to take out a private loan, though, but don't know where to start looking, and I have no idea where to look for scholarships. 

If I can't avoid the PLUS loans I think I'll consider dropping out of college, but I want that to be a last resort.

t3_g4w6kl,StudentLoans,Need advice for next steps,"25 years old, 4th year out of college and finally in a good place financially to really get the ball rolling on my student loans (\~33k).  I've only been making the minimum payments using an IDR which hasn't done much in bringing down principal/interest. Currently in a REPAYE plan. Over the last year and half, my main focus was creating an emergency fund. Since I was only making minimum payments, I didn't put my extra funds towards student loans. Honestly, my financial situation my first 2 years out of college was very hard (IDR min payment $0 to student loans during then) and psychologically I just needed to see my checking account balance go up which I know probably didn't do me any favors for repayment. Hoping to fix all of that. 

I have 2 loan servicers, one through my university and other though Great Lakes.  The loan through my school isn't in forbearance from COVID but everything else is. I listed out my loans below:

School: 

* $4,400 (5%)

Federal: 

* Sub $5,600 (4.29%)
* Unsub $2,200 (4.29%)

* Sub $4,600 (3.86%)
* Unsub $2,400 (3.86%)
* Sub $3,600 (3.40%)
* Unsub $2,900 (6.8%)

I have the ability to payoff up to 6/7k but not sure where to put that first. Should I just pay off my $4,400 school loan since the interest isn't at 0% right now? Or should I pay off the unsub $2,900 (6.8%)? I also have just under $600 in unpaid interest, so should that be the first thing I pay off? If I put anything towards the federal loans, should I just hold off until September when everything restarts? I've been reading about the snowball or avalanche methods, but I still get very lost in what would best work for me. AGI is about 46k/year. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

t3_g4qj2d,StudentLoans,I think an acquaintance of mine just got scammed,"I was casually having a conversation with an acquaintance of mine and we got into the topic of student loans. I was telling him my repayment strategy when he said he got his wiped. He went on telling me about how ""there's a loophole"" and that an old classmate of his that ""works for the government"" helps people with this kind of stuff as a side hustle. 

He said he charged him $2000 with a promise that he can wipe out his SLs from all 3 of the major credit bureaus by claiming that they are fraudulent. He went on to explain that since these private servicing companies like Navient, Sallie Mae, FedLoans, ""bought"" your loans from the government...that you're not entitled to pay them at all. His logic is that the promissory note you signed when you signed with FAFSA doesn't obligate you to pay these private parties because they would'nt be able to produce that promissory note if any of the bureuas decided to do an audit. He said his friend has a 6 month guarantee or your money back so he's not worried. He started the process back in February and he said he started seeing accounts being labeled as ""closed"" on his FedLoan account as early as March as well as those accounts being labeled as closed on his Experian account. He even showed me screenshots of it which I'm wary of.

He sent me his friend's info and I checked it out. It's a consulting agency website full of screenshots of happy customers and their credit karma/Experian dashboards with improving credit scores. He doesnt just do this with SLs. He also provides services related to credit card debt, mortgage debt, and more. I checked out his Instagram and it was only created back in November 2019.

I was obviously suspicious so I dug up my old promissory notes and looked for where it mentions anything about paying through a servicer....and it's everywhere. I also checked out Studentaid.gov and found a section saying:

""In some cases, we need to transfer loans from one servicer to another servicer. **If we transfer your federal student loans from one servicer to another servicer, your loans will still be owned by ED.

First off, loans are awful especially if I am planning to take on 200k to attend Northeastern. While it is a good college, I'm sure most people will say the reputation isn't worth it. And especially because I am studying computer science, the major itself will land me a stable or decent job out of college.  Despite knowing all this, my mind can't seem to let go of NEU.

Northeastern I've heard that CS majors handle the debt well due to their Co-op programs paying 20 to 35 dollars an hour for a 6 month period. The school itself is in a great location and its very easy to make connections. 

So basically in the end, I am asking if 56k a year debt for (except my first semester my parents will pay for) a better reputation school and potential for 3 internships is reasonable than a 33k year debt (which my parents can probably push for paying the whole year) for a very good reputation school of UMass","NEU...?I'm sure you've seen a bunch of these before but I appreciate any help in advance.

t3_g4uf70,StudentLoans,403b changes in the CARES act,"Hey all 

Was looking for some advice on a couple of scenarios. Me and my wife hold about 60k in private student loans. We also Federal loans and we are both on the PSLF track. 

Given that our loans have varying interest rates I was going to try and consolidate our loans to the lowest fixed rate I could find (for reference all of our loans have about 13 years left in the term). I just received an email from my job detailing some of the changes in the cares act. 

From what I understand I could withdraw up to 100k and the pre withdrawal penalty would be waived bit I would still need to pay income taxes. I also could spread those taxes over 3 years. 

For some background me and my wife’s jobs are pretty secure and are very unlikely to be affected. So here are my options (assuming I qualified)

Option 1 : consolidate my loans and my wife’s loans into two separate loans (one for each of us) with the lowest fixed rate I can get at the same or similar payment term. Will continue to pay the same monthly amount as I am currently so any savings would lead to a sooner payoff

Option 2 : withdraw the money needed to payoff the loans in full. Likely spread the income tax payments over 3 years. My primary retirement account currently sits at about 130k and this will be a big hit. Will take the money saved from paying off and focus on maxing out both of our 403b plans to recoup losses

Option 3: consolidate now while interest rates are low. Wait to see if the market improves before the end of the year (these rules are in effect until Dec 2020). With an improved market my plan will likely have recouped some losses and I could withdraw then. 

Thanks in advance for the advice","403b changes in the CARES actHey all 

Was looking for some advice on a couple of scenarios. Me and my wife hold about 60k in private student loans. We also Federal loans and we are both on the PSLF track. 

Given that our loans have varying interest rates I was going to try and consolidate our loans to the lowest fixed rate I could find (for reference all of our loans have about 13 years left in the term). I just received an email from my job detailing some of the changes in the cares act. 

From what I understand I could withdraw up to 100k and the pre withdrawal penalty would be waived bit I would still need to pay income taxes. I also could spread those taxes over 3 years. 

For some background me and my wife’s jobs are pretty secure and are very unlikely to be affected. So here are my options (assuming I qualified)

Option 1 : consolidate my loans and my wife’s loans into two separate loans (one for each of us) with the lowest fixed rate I can get at the same or similar payment term. Will continue to pay the same monthly amount as I am currently so any savings would lead to a sooner payoff

t3_g4y86k,StudentLoans,Student Loan Forbearance May Impact Credit Reporting?,"I contacted Great Lakes to ask about how forbearance impacts credit reporting. I heard that other types of loans, such as mortgages, when placed in forbearance will be reported as such on a credit report; lenders may look at forbearance negatively, even if there is no delinquency or missed payment reported. I asked if that would also happen with student loan forbearance and if participating in forbearance could impact my credit and/or ability to qualify for a mortgage in the future.

Great Lakes responded:

""Each credit bureau has its own unique method and product for determining credit scores. Because their products are proprietary, we are uncertain what exact credit values are used and how they are weighed. We do know that maintaining a sound payment history and successfully managing your account so that late payments don’t occur is a benefit for credit scoring.

Our office reports a number of data pieces on your account, the current status, the loan open date, high credit (total disbursed amount minus refunds), payoff amount, which includes late charges and all accrued interest, and the amount and date of your last payment. We also report the type of loan, and your obligation towards the loan.

For your convenience, we have included a list of the credit bureaus. Their customer service staff may be able to discuss how your student loan impacts your credit score.""

I called Great Lakes and asked to have the forbearance removed from my account and the officer said to ""give it some time."" When I asked how long, they said it would usually take 3-5 business days, but a lot of people are asking to be taken out of forbearance right now so it could take longer. My payments were formerly due on the 23rd, so I asked if I should go ahead and make a payment before then since the process may not be complete by then. The officer said I probably should so that my account wouldn't be past due.

I called TransUnion and they said it would not impact my score, but forbearance would be reported. They said it's up to the lender how they want to interpret forbearance and that ""hopefully"" lenders would be understanding since forbearance was automatic.

I know this is a whole new process for everyone, but it worries me that companies don't seem to have the details worked out. I've paid more than my monthly payment for the life of my student loan and am on track to pay it off years early. I had planned on saving my payments for then next 6 months, then making a large payment in September. That's the advice I've seen here, on other subreddits, and heard from other people. I would hate to have difficulty borrowing money for a house one day because I was automatically placed in forbearance and didn't make payments when I could have. Just wanted to give others a heads up and see if anyone else has heard anything different.","Student Loan Forbearance May Impact Credit Reporting?I contacted Great Lakes to ask about how forbearance impacts credit reporting.

t3_g4y6vg,StudentLoans,Where/how should I allocate the monthly loan payment during COVID for best results?,"I'm not too financially savvy and was wondering what kind of work I'd need to do to figure out what the best option for my school loan payments would be during COVID's repayment period. I'm partaking in the PSLF program, so after 120 payments, they get discharged. I have no faith this program will make it through the next presidential cycle so would like to pay something towards them despite all the payments being on forbearance. I would still like to contribute the amount I'm usually paying per month to my debt and this amount could pay off four smaller loans by the time the forbearance is lifted. I don't know how much interest this would save me over the years, however. Nor do I know if this is the best option for lowering my burden. Would it be better to put this monthly payment to the accumulated interest, the smaller loans to pay them off and get them off the account, or just to a bigger loan? Or something else that I'm failing to see?

t3_g4ngnt,StudentLoans,Issues with acquiring verification of non-filing letter,"Hi y'all

So my school's requested me to submit a verification of non-filing letter from the IRS to confirm that I am indeed as poor as I say I am.

I've heard most people have to end up going to a local IRS office in order to have the necessary form printed out for them. However, in response to the current crisis all offices have been closed until further notice.

I’m not going to be able to continue living with them after I graduate HS because they are moving out of state.

t3_g4g4sd,StudentLoans,Student loan monster,"Hey guys. I'm new to the sub and joined looking to see if anyone had insight on how to deal with this monster amount of student loans I've accumulated and/or how you manage the anxiety that comes with it.

I grew up in poverty and really didn't have a clear idea of what was normal or not finance-wise. When I applied to University and got in, my family was over the moon as I'd be the first to attend. We didn't know what we were doing, we just knew that if I went to school I'd make a lot of money someday, and be able to pay off whatever we borrowed. We were very ignorant.

I had to borrow every penny to attend school and worked part time jobs the entire time to afford food and gas money. I had scholarships and grants, but they didn't help much.

I was told that going to a state school wouldn't be as good and that I was guaranteed to make more coming from a private University. I know now that that was a load of shit. 

Now I am $126,000 in debt. I emerged with bachelor's and master's degrees in Speech Language Pathology and have a good job now that I've graduated and gotten out of school. My current job gets me ~46k before taxes with benefits, and working on the school year schedule. My first year of work is considered a fellowship year and has reduced pay. My husband is in the process of gaining his master's and is anticipating a starting 70k/year. He will come out with another ~42k in loans.

We are already far beyond where my family is and how I grew up, but I'm worried about paying off these loans and ending up where I started. Anytime I think about repayment I freak out. I see so many people struggling to pay off loans of 20-40k and that terrifies me because mine is 4x greater.

My base student loan bill will be $1,300/month. We might be able to get it down to ~800/month through income based repayment. I know this is possible, but I just don't know how to approach this.


TLDR: Grew up poor and didn't understand money. Ended up with a Master's degree and 126k in debt.

t3_g43ngw,StudentLoans,54K Private Debt DONE! +++Plus+++ 3 Legged Cat Tax (Included: How not to kill yourself in this process),"**CELEBRATION!**

&amp;nbsp;

***AND FOR YOUR PLEASURE:*  --HOW NOT TO KILL YOURSELF--** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Cat tax 1:**  (scroll down to bottom for 2nd cat tax)  https://imgur.com/6Ya4Y6i

&amp;nbsp; 

**Private DEBT:**  **54,000 thousand** -Starting at 10% interest ending in 13% interest 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2011:**  

* Graduated in 2011 from a private-for profit college.   I was working 100 hour weeks between graduation, a full time job, and an internship. 

*  Broke up with alcoholic boyfriend.   Lapsed into a monotonous depression.   Did not pay my student loans at all this year.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2012:** 

* Bought an ipad.   Used lots of forbearance. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2013:** 

* Ran out of money via reduced hours in the winter.   Cried in the bathroom because I didn’t have enough money to replace my uniform that went missing.  Didn’t have enough money for food.   Asked reddit about food banks and someone send me over 100 dollars for food.  (Thank you!)  

* Listened to the book “Total Money Makeover” by Dave Ramsey.   Something clicked, I got hope, never looked back.  Saved up for 1,000 emergency fund.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2014:**  

* Paid off 3,000 worth of credit card debt with my tax refund.  Worked all available overtime. 

* Income 31k to 34k 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2015:**
  
* Car broke down, needed emergency repairs.   
* Changed jobs after getting passed up 3x for a promotion.    Now a supervisor. Worked all available overtime.  34k to 37k

&amp;nbsp; 

**2016:**   

* Chipped and lost tooth.   3k worth of dental bills, 1.5k not covered by insurance.  Chipped another tooth and needed a root canal.   Insurance maxed out.  2.5k worth of dental bills.
* Working a 2nd job part time but had to quit because it was too draining. 
* Sober ex got back into my life and then started drinking again.  Broke into my house. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2017**

* Another junker broke down.  Emergency fund again depleted.   
* Did not get the promotion I wanted.  Contemplated suicide.  I thought about suicide a lot, but this was my only real time I felt like I needed to do it.   The urge was sudden, out of nowhere, and very powerful.  The pull to do it was intense.  I had access to the roof and all I had to do was jump off.    Starting calling the hotline.  Have called it once a year since probably.  They will totally talk to you even if you're not suicidal.   Any crisis where I feel overwhelmed, I will call.  
* Rejected by many loan refinancing companies. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2018:** 

* More emergency car repairs.  
* Got promoted to manager of another department.  The job was incredibly toxic.  I regret taking that job until this day.   Started getting anxiety attacks on the regular.   Income 37k to 39k.  
* Got rejected by many loan refinancing companies.  
* Discovered minimalism by watching “Minimalism” and got rid of and sold 50% of my belongings 
* Sold my entire video game collection, my gaming systems, my manga, my bike, and anything else of significant value for extra money.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2019:**
   
* Switched departments.   Back to a department that was monotonous.  New boss is very unprofessional, hard to talk to, and she gives me terrible hours and little help to do my job.    
* Both of my cats got bitten and severally infected.  I thought I was going to be the first person in my city to die of rabies (we did not have rabies.)  Had a nervous breakdown.     One cat recovered with antibiotics.  Other cat lost a leg.  Accidentally took cat to the most expensive animal hospital, 6,000 bill and amputation.   Added to debt snowball and paid off 6k bill. 
* Got approved by Lendkey.   13% rate down to 6.25 interest rate for remaining 17k loan.   Freaking finally
* Took a pay cut to get out of the hospitality industry and protect my mental health.  40k to 37k.   Started working in the medical field.  New boss is both fake and crazy.   My job was essentially trying to force old and disabled people to use a small ipad against their will.   Got fired for the first time in my life.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2020:**  

* Got rehired in hospitality management in late 2019.  Working crazy overtime.   37k bumped to 48k.    
* Started throwing money at my debt at an unprecedented rate.  
* Missed my final payment due to getting furloughed.
* Just got unemployment and stimulus check.   Hahaha, lets do this.  (Don’t worry, I still have 2k in reserve!) 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Things that helped:**

* Switching jobs when you can’t get promoted
* My emergency fund saved my ass every year with junker car repairs. 
* Eating out only a few times a year and on special occasions 
* Following Dave Ramsey’s plan, starting with the lowest debt and working towards the highest debt.  
* Selling everything, sacrificing everything to win  
* Getting into minimalism and seeing how little I need to own because I don't use the things I have. 
* Making enough money to get approved for refinancing 
* Not dating anyone.   Going out= spending $$$ 
* Libraries!  Coffee shops!  MY FREAKING GOD I LOVE THE LIBRARY 
* Holy s---, between paying off all my care credit dentist bills, credit cards, vet bills, and private student loans, my credit score is f---ing amazing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Things I struggled with**

* Getting started.  My very first “extra” payment was 30 dollars and I remember how awful it felt because the entire thing went to interest and didn’t hit the principle at all.   That was sad.  Getting started when your debt is so high and your interest is so high, it’s feels impossible to make a dent at first. 
* Not seeing my family very often, out of state
* My mental health.  I decided paying off my private debt was worth my life (in the good and bad sense.)

Cat tax 2:  (showing missing leg!) https://imgur.com/0PAYTQq

Final Cat tax: https://imgur.com/a/teSt09h

&amp;nbsp; 

I have not been a huge earner.  You CAN do this making 30k + overtime or a second job.  You can switch jobs and make more.   There is nothing fun or easy about being on the grind, because that's exactly what it feels like.  But you CAN do it.    All it takes is time, hard work and being willing to be completely and utterly bored on a day to day basis.  Not getting derailed when emergencies happen (because they will happen) is essential.    

&amp;nbsp;

AMA if you want!","54K Private Debt DONE! +++Plus+++ 3 Legged Cat Tax (Included: How not to kill yourself in this process)**CELEBRATION!**

&amp;nbsp;

***AND FOR YOUR PLEASURE:*  --HOW NOT TO KILL YOURSELF--** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Cat tax 1:**  (scroll down to bottom for 2nd cat tax)  https://imgur.com/6Ya4Y6i

&amp;nbsp; 

**Private DEBT:**  **54,000 thousand** -Starting at 10% interest ending in 13% interest 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2011:**  

* Graduated in 2011 from a private-for profit college.   I was working 100 hour weeks between graduation, a full time job, and an internship. 

*  Broke up with alcoholic boyfriend.   Lapsed into a monotonous depression.   Did not pay my student loans at all this year.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2012:** 

* Bought an ipad.   Used lots of forbearance. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2013:** 

* Ran out of money via reduced hours in the winter.   Cried in the bathroom because I didn’t have enough money to replace my uniform that went missing.  Didn’t have enough money for food.   Asked reddit about food banks and someone send me over 100 dollars for food.  (Thank you!)  

* Listened to the book “Total Money Makeover” by Dave Ramsey.   Something clicked, I got hope, never looked back.  Saved up for 1,000 emergency fund.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2014:**  

* Paid off 3,000 worth of credit card debt with my tax refund.  Worked all available overtime. 

* Income 31k to 34k 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2015:**
  
* Car broke down, needed emergency repairs.   
* Changed jobs after getting passed up 3x for a promotion.    Now a supervisor. Worked all available overtime.  34k to 37k

&amp;nbsp; 

**2016:**   

* Chipped and lost tooth.   3k worth of dental bills, 1.5k not covered by insurance.  Chipped another tooth and needed a root canal.   Insurance maxed out.  2.5k worth of dental bills.
* Working a 2nd job part time but had to quit because it was too draining. 
* Sober ex got back into my life and then started drinking again.  Broke into my house. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2017**

* Another junker broke down.  Emergency fund again depleted.   
* Did not get the promotion I wanted.  Contemplated suicide.  I thought about suicide a lot, but this was my only real time I felt like I needed to do it.   The urge was sudden, out of nowhere, and very powerful.  The pull to do it was intense.  I had access to the roof and all I had to do was jump off.    Starting calling the hotline.  Have called it once a year since probably.  They will totally talk to you even if you're not suicidal.   Any crisis where I feel overwhelmed, I will call.  
* Rejected by many loan refinancing companies. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2018:** 

* More emergency car repairs.  
* Got promoted to manager of another department.  The job was incredibly toxic.  I regret taking that job until this day.   Started getting anxiety attacks on the regular.   Income 37k to 39k.  
* Got rejected by many loan refinancing companies.  
* Discovered minimalism by watching “Minimalism” and got rid of and sold 50% of my belongings 
* Sold my entire video game collection, my gaming systems, my manga, my bike, and anything else of significant value for extra money.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2019:**
   
* Switched departments.   Back to a department that was monotonous.  New boss is very unprofessional, hard to talk to, and she gives me terrible hours and little help to do my job.    
* Both of my cats got bitten and severally infected.  I thought I was going to be the first person in my city to die of rabies (we did not have rabies.)  Had a nervous breakdown.     One cat recovered with antibiotics.  Other cat lost a leg.  Accidentally took cat to the most expensive animal hospital, 6,000 bill and amputation.   Added to debt snowball and paid off 6k bill. 
* Got approved by Lendkey.   13% rate down to 6.25 interest rate for remaining 17k loan.   Freaking finally
* Took a pay cut to get out of the hospitality industry and protect my mental health.  40k to 37k.   Started working in the medical field.  New boss is both fake and crazy.   My job was essentially trying to force old and disabled people to use a small ipad against their will.   Got fired for the first time in my life.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2020:**  

* Got rehired in hospitality management in late 2019.  Working crazy overtime.   37k bumped to 48k.    
* Started throwing money at my debt at an unprecedented rate.  
* Missed my final payment due to getting furloughed.
* Just got unemployment and stimulus check.   Hahaha, lets do this.  (Don’t worry, I still have 2k in reserve!) 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Things that helped:**

* Switching jobs when you can’t get promoted
* My emergency fund saved my ass every year with junker car repairs. 
* Eating out only a few times a year and on special occasions 
* Following Dave Ramsey’s plan, starting with the lowest debt and working towards the highest debt.  
* Selling everything, sacrificing everything to win  
* Getting into minimalism and seeing how little I need to own because I don't use the things I have. 
* Making enough money to get approved for refinancing 
* Not dating anyone.   Going out= spending $$$ 
* Libraries!  Coffee shops!  MY FREAKING GOD I LOVE THE LIBRARY 
* Holy s---, between paying off all my care credit dentist bills, credit cards, vet bills, and private student loans, my credit score is f---ing amazing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Things I struggled with**

* Getting started.  My very first “extra” payment was 30 dollars and I remember how awful it felt because the entire thing went to interest and didn’t hit the principle at all.   That was sad.  Getting started when your debt is so high and your interest is so high, it’s feels impossible to make a dent at first. 
* Not seeing my family very often, out of state
* My mental health.  I decided paying off my private debt was worth my life (in the good and bad sense.)
* Every emergency was another gut punch, another setback even if I could pay for it.   
* Income going up slowly instead of quickly.  Feeling like other people are making more money than you while reminding yourself many people make less than you. 
* The never ending monotony.   Staying home day after day after day after day.    It’s like walking in the desert for six years.  You know there’s water in 6 years, but you’re thirsty, and tired, but if you keep walking… every day, every day, for six years…. It will be over.

t3_g48jc5,StudentLoans,Advice for paying off loans in light of CARES Act?,"Hi all,

So far I’ve taken $110k of debt down to $49.5. I have another $5k I can pay it down with. Around $24k is at 6.3% and the rest is 6.55%. I’ve been paying down the 6.55d quicker. But now under the CARES Act, interest on the 6.55s is 0 until September 30th. 6.3s are Federal loans but of a type that aren’t changed by the act so continue to accrue interest. 

So far job is steady though like everything else right now, no guarantee. Do have a significant emergency fund (more than they typically advise be put aside)

What is my best option for now:

1.  Pay down the 6.55s now since more will go to principal

2. Pay down the 6.3s even though the rate is lower

3. Put the amounts in high yield (1.9%) savings in case I ultimately need the cash then pay down the 6.55s shortly before September 30

Thoughts?

t3_g4ae21,StudentLoans,Refinancing Options,"Hey guys! I need some assistance with refinancing my student loans. I'm set to graduate college in May with a Marketing degree, and I have a job lined up that will pay 45k per year with up to 10k in bonuses per year. I have 65k in loans over the 5 years I was in school. 38k is private through Sallie Mae and College Ave. 27k is federal. I've read that I should consider keeping my federal loans where they are at, but I need to refinance my private ones ASAP. My SM rates are between 7.25% and 11.75%. Obviously there's a lot of room for improvement there. 

My biggest thing is that I want to lower my interest rate and not pay a ridiculously high amount every month right out of college. For some strange reason, I'm kind of okay with potentially a 15+ year repayment option, and increase my payment amount as my salary grows. My reasoning for this is because my car is kind of starting to show its age, and I want something newer/more fun to drive since I'll have a long commute to work every day. Not a necessity by any means, but just something fun for me that I've wanted to do for a while. 

Where should I look to refinance to get the best long term rates possible? Of course I'll be shopping rates at a few places, but I need to get away from my private companies and get a better rate.

t3_g4dmhz,StudentLoans,"Just had an idea that could reduce my federal student loan interest rate, thoughts?","I have a significant amount of student loans from undergrad and then straight to 5 year grad program and barely made payments on them. I would say on average the interest rate from all loans is 6.8%

I have a savings account with Ally that pays 1.5% APR , a credit card that offers unlimited 2% cash back on all bill pays/transactions. If I put for example about 6 months worth of minimum payments lump sum in the savings account, used the credit card to pay my minimum payment loan gaining 2% CB, then paying the credit card right away from savings account which gained that 1.5% interest on the amount, would I be technically dropping my loan interest from 6.8% to 3.3%. all this of course would be setup with auto pay automatically (which actually lowers my interest rate by 0.25%). So final interest rate would be basically 3.05% without losing the benefits of having a federal loan if times get tough instead of refinancing with a private lender.

Hey guys, I have been periodically posting my updates over the last year.

Last May I graduated with a masters degree and $55,000 in student loans and I have spent the last year aggressively repaying them back.

Though I have been paying back a regular $3,000/month like clockwork, my recent tax returns, reimbursed PTO, and my covid check have allowed me to recently deposit a few lump sum payments totaling $12,000.

In total, over the last 11 months I have paid back over $42,000 and I am currently just $14,000 in debt.

I am expecting an amended tax return of another $2,000, so that really just leaves $12,000 for me to take care of. At my current pace ($3,000/month), I expect to pay this off by August of 2020, which coincides with my 24th birthday.

Y'all, I'm friggin pumped. Student loans have been the only thing on my mind since I began college in 2014... While it has certainly been an emotionally difficult challenge, I feel blessed to have learned to meticulously manage my personal finances, a skill I don't plan on throwing away once I finish.","$42,000 down, $14,000 to go.[Visualization](https://imgur.com/a/Tm1nAF9)

I am currently coming in to my “last year”  of engineering at my college. I want to quit my job, and really knock this thing out of the park GPA wise. However, I have always had to work a second job to supplement my student loans; and be able to live. As the government usually only leaves me with around 1000-1500 for the remainder of the semester after books are paid for. 

I was curious if anyone had experience taking government loans out for college, and then an additional “micro” private “student-loan” for living expenses? Such as like 10,000 for the year. I would like to emphasize “student loan” not a personal loan. 

I understand the Pros and cons, of additional loans and interest buildup. I am very good with money, and absolutely have a plan to combat this. However, I want to know if the government/loan organization will allow MULTIPLE STUDENT loans to be taken out through the year.","Private loan on top of student loan?Hi,

t3_g3yo4a,StudentLoans,Advice needed: I am overly obsessing about my loans,"I am obsessing about my student loans. I graduated with my Masters in Education in Counseling about 1.5 years ago. Despite my salary hoving around 40K (43K come September), I earn an additional max of $700 per month in working O/T (8 hours per week). I found out the hard way that working as a crisis phone counselor beyond 8 extra hours is beyond what I could handle; so 8 hrs is where it has remained. 

In 1.5 years I have already been able to throw 16K towards my debt bringing it to a total of 37K. The freeze on my interest rates (5.45%) and the forbearance is going to save me about 1K in interest over this six-month period. In which time I may be able to drop an 8K bomb on my loans come September by saving my typical monthly payment of $650 along with keeping up with the O/T work pace. 

I am going with the avalanche method as 3/4 of my smaller loans are sitting at 5.75% interest and my biggest (17K) is sitting at 4.75% interest. I even plan on using my upcoming raise in September to put an additional $100 per month towards my monthly loans bringing it up from $650 to $750. I have remained fairly disciplined with my budgeting and have decreased/eliminated poor habits like drinking or smoking which has saved me quite a bit. 

Aggressively, if I keep up this pace I could annihilate my loans in 2-3 more years. Conservatively, if I ease up on the aggression after this temporary student loan freeze, I am looking more at 4 more years. Though this does not take into account that I would hopefully be earning more in that time frame as well. But, I have no way of calculating how much that could be in my field. My LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor)  is now secured which opens up options for jobs I actually want with (hopefully) better pay. Yet this pandemic as thrown a huge wrench into that plan. In which case I am lucky and thankful to still be employed. 

Despite all this planning, I find myself on a nearly daily basis rewriting my budget, rewriting my student loan payment plan or reading article after article about finding more ways to save. Or hoping I'll come across a news article that confirms additional coronavirus financial assistance or that the Democrats plan to forgive 10-30K in loans is picking up traction (though I know this will not happen). 

This does not at all feel healthy to me anymore as I feel like I am circling the wagons rather than trusting that I am already doing all that I can. Can anyone relate to this? Any advice? Tips? Words of wisdom?","Advice needed: I am overly obsessing about my loansI am obsessing about my student loans. I graduated with my Masters in Education in Counseling about 1.5 years ago.

I am currently nearing the end of my first year at an out-of-state university, so tuition is quite high (basically 45k a year). My parents have paid for the first year but they cannot afford to anymore. They are willing to be co-sponsors of any loan I take but they do not want to take out the Parent PLUS loans because then the responsibility falls on the parent to pay it off.

I am planning to graduate in three years so I have to borrow for the next two years. I will be graduating with a computer science degree from a good public school so hopefully I will be able to have a steady income after graduation to pay off whatever debt I do rack up.

t3_g3vhey,StudentLoans,Will CARES Forbearance Show Up On Credit Report?,"I've heard that mortgage forbearance may show up on credit reports-not necessarily as a derogatory mark, but as a missed payment due to forbearance. It wouldn't have a negative impact on credit score, but loan providers may look at a missed payment due to forbearance as an inability to pay (and riskier loan). Does anyone know if federal student loan payments may show up the same way? My hope is that it wouldn't, especially since all federal loans were automatically placed in forbearance rather than by request.

It wouldn't have a negative impact on credit score, but loan providers may look at a missed payment due to forbearance as an inability to pay (and riskier loan).

t3_g317am,StudentLoans,"$112,749 of debt (just principal...) finally paid off!","Hi everyone!

I posted previously about being debt free (about $50,000), but my husband also had a little over $60,000 in student loans. He’s been graduated since 2017, but he didn’t make much progress on them considering his $35-40,000 salary, so it was about $55k when I graduated and actually started working in October 2019. 

Definitely made a lot of sacrifices along the way - most of my peers live in luxury apartments with expensive cars and take lavish vacations, etc., but I still drive my $5k piece of shit and live in a tiny 700 sqft box and pretty much threw every possible dollar at the loans, and it’s paid off (literally)! Can’t even express how relieved I am. I know I’m fortunate to make a relatively high salary, so I know most people don’t have the luxury of paying their loans off so quickly despite an even stronger work ethic, so I really am grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given.

t3_g3u4zi,StudentLoans,So what does this CARES Act mean?,"I found this in my student loan inbox last night, from earlier this month.  There's no bill for later this month either.  I would like to continue paying my normal loan amount this month, but there's no bill for it.  Does this mean I shouldn't pay anything until I'm billing, probably after Sept 2020?  My loan is supposed to be forgiven next year.  Not paying means that potentially put back another six months.  I already got screwed over and had six payments not count, so the forgiveness date is six months behind what it's supposed to do.  I would like to continue normal payments.  I would NOT like to make payments and then be told, ""Oh, those payments don't count.  Whoever told you that was wrong,"" by the Public Service Loan Forgiveness tallying people.  That's what happened with previous payments when they tallied it up after the five year mark.  At least I've got something official in writing here.  






On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your federally owned loans that we service for ED.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.
In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program loans. If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:
●
0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.
●
Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.
Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.
Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends.","So what does this CARES Act mean?I found this in my student loan inbox last night, from earlier this month.

t3_g3dn3r,StudentLoans,Post that was deleted on a sub that advocates for default,"This was deleted and I was banned. Just a warning to anyone considering taking their advice.

edit: This is about moving overseas to avoid Student Loans. These are just my thoughts on the matter based on my own research.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I want to say that I completely empathize with you guys. I'm in default myself and it sucks.

I see a lot of people posting this little blurb from the DOS website about how no country has a treaty with the US for the reciprocal enforcement of judgements. Right, there isn't a treaty. But that doesn't mean countries don't have mechanisms in place for enforcing foreign judgments. They all do and it works on the principle of reciprocity. If the foreign country has a history of enforcing the host countries' judgements, the host country in turn will enforce the foreign countries' judgements. The US has established reciprocity with almost every country in the world. This includes China. You can be sued here in the United States and that judgement can be brought to almost any country in the world and they will enforce it. Whether they will or not .. I'll get to that in a minute.

The bit about excessive money judgements ... that's about punitive damages. That has nothing to do with us. We owe money and it can proven that we are 100% liable for the money we owe.

On Statute of Limitations and Serving Papers. If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars on your head, they're going to sue you. And you don't have to be around for it either. Serving papers Is for the defendant's benefit. It's so the defendant can know about the lawsuit and have a chance to defend themselves. The plaintiff just has to try their best to find the defendant. If they do that, the judge will let them enter a motion for default judgement and grant it. ""Ah, but now the clock starts ticking"" No. The clock does not tick when you are hiding. This is true for the SOL on the time to bring suit and the SOL to enforce the judgement. You can't hide for 6 or whatever number of years and go ""AHA, you couldn't find me. Time's up"" So this leaving the country deal means that this problem will never go away.

If they can find you (and that's not hard these days) and the amount of money that they would spend to domesticate the judgement is less than the amount of money they would get from you, they will bring the judgement to your new country and have it enforced. There isn't anywhere you could really go to build up assets and be safe. Hate to say it.

Someones probably going to say like ""Well, I've never heard of this happening"" or ""This doesn't happen very often"". You've never heard of it because you aren't in a position to hear about it. These things are locked away in the civil court records of the local governments of these foreign countries. And you can't really know how often it happens without looking. What you've heard (or haven't heard) from people on reddit or google searches .. that's not a good sample. If anything, it's an echo chamber.

Is it totally pointless to go abroad? It does help you avoid AWG and Im sure you'd be fine for many, many years. But these loan balances are going to be huge in 10-20 years. People are going to have half a million, million dollar bounties on their heads. If you've built up assets, why wouldn't they come after you???","Post that was deleted on a sub that advocates for defaultThis was deleted and I was banned.

Now with that out of the way, I obviously know that 100% scholarships are better in every way.

Will I be able to apply for enough scholarships to cover most of the cost (around $34k) or should I immediately apply for student loans since I did not find out about this until recently?

Also if I do end up applying for student loans can I still apply for scholarships and pay off my tuition using that to reduce the amount of student loans or can I only do one or the other?

Any advice is appreciated and am more than willing to answer any follow up questions, thanks in advance.

So, I was looking at the first payment I made earlier this month and I noticed that almost half of it was applied to interest.

t3_g2oewa,StudentLoans,0% Federal loan payment strategy question.,"TLDR on 10 year repayment plan, and started in November so basically 9.5 years left or so. So I have seen people say to not pay then do a lump sum payment at the end before interest starts back up. My question is which loan would be wiser to target. I pay $500 a month but had been paying an extra $100 towards a single low balance but high interest loan. There are two more loans with a larger balance and same high interest rate. For easy math and numbers let’s say 7% the lowest is 2,100 the second is 3,000 and the highest is 7,000. My thought is since I normally pay $600 a month, I should fully pay off the 3,000 loan. Over the 6 months and pay an extra $600 on the next smallest to get it gone faster. My thought is that it removes a loan completely and will never pay more interest on but lower the balance of the lowest one by the last $600 to start snowballing faster. Targeting the 7k would mean 3,4K left over and all 3 loans would have the same interest rate. I guess you could say I have one loan of 12,100 at 7% so does it even really matter?

Looking for some advice, I have a decent emergency fund built up and plan on paying the debt instead of keeping the savings.","0% Federal loan payment strategy question.TLDR on 10 year repayment plan, and started in November so basically 9.5 years left or so.

Just what the title says. I’m 23 with a masters degree in Mental Health. I have 17 student loans (one I already paid off!!!) and I’m not sure the best method to pay them off in. Not sure if I should target the highest balances, highest interest, or lowest balances! I was focusing on the Sallie Mae loans, because they’re less forgiving, and am actually currently paying on the one with *** next to it, but not sure if there was a better method 🤷🏻‍♀️.

t3_g2gmsm,StudentLoans,Is $125k too much to take out in loans?,"Let me know if this isn’t the right place to ask these kinds of questions!

I’m headed to law school in the fall and was accepted to two really great schools. The one that I want to attend more was going to cost me ~$65k in tuition and ~$60k in living expenses across the three years, so $125k in total. Coming out of law school, I would probably start out at $50k salary for the type of law I want to practice. The school has a LRAP to cover 100% of loans paid each for 10 years with a salary cap of $65k, and only allows for 1 year of a break (ie, maternity leave).

The debt scared me, a lot. I ended up depositing at a school that isn’t as exciting to me and will cost me &lt;$60k in living expenses only (free tuition scholarship). This school does not have a LRAP.

No one in my family has had to take out this much in loans before and so I feel pretty financially illiterate when it comes to loans. For both schools, I qualified for the max amount of Federal Direct ($20.5k) and for the ideal school, I would apply for Federal Grad Plus. From what I understand, they currently have interest rates of ~ 6% and 7%, respectively, but those are expected to decrease thanks to COVID. From the perspective of people who are working to pay of loans, do you think that debt ($125k plus interest) would be manageable? I don’t necessarily think I need assurance that I made the right choice, but like I said, I feel pretty financially illiterate and will have loans either way so I’m just trying to get a feel for reality of life with loans like this.","Is $125k too much to take out in loans?Let me know if this isn’t the right place to ask these kinds of questions!

t3_g2l17q,StudentLoans,Student Loan Payoff Plan,"Hi all,

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on my student loan repayment plan as I am entering repayment in a couple months and would like to make sure that my payment plan minimizes interest payment.

A little background, I am a recent graduate who is currently only working part-time, however I am searching for full-time jobs (Although it's hard with current events). This should help boost my income and how much I can pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

My current loans are as follows:

|Loan|Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal Sub|3500|4.29%|
|Federal Sub|5500|3.76%|
|Federal Unsub|2500|3.76%|
|Federal Sub|5500|4.45%|
|Federal Sub|5500|5.05%|
|Perkins|2000|5.00%|

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to payoff the Perkins loan because it is through Heartland ECSI, and I have not heard a single good thing about them so I would like to get rid of this one as soon as possible.

After that, I plan on making minimum payments and paying extra towards the high interest loans. Once I have paid off up to the 4.29% loan, I plan on just making minimum payments on the 3.76% loans and saving more towards retirement. I am hoping to pay this off in around a year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Does my plan sound okay? Are there any other repayment options I should be considering?

&amp;#x200B;

t3_g2g8wa,StudentLoans,Why you shouldn't use loan forgiveness,"So I explained in the Dave Ramsey subreddit why he is wrong about these programs. Wrong in execution not on if you should or not. Here is why and the real reason why these programs suck.

Example: 

You make 50k a year and your loan is 150k and you're on income based repayment. One of the plans is 20% of you discretionary income. So let's say after essentials are paid you have 1k left so 20% is 200/month. Now these aren't exact numbers but close enough.

Average student loan interest: 5.8%

Payment: $200

Per month interest: ~ $724

After 300 months, your loan will have a balance of 490k... So now that gets forgiven, great! You now have to pay 35% income tax on 499+50k which is around 192k. Yes someone making 50k even if you got a 2% raise every year is only 90k won't be able to afford that and guess what, the IRS will garnish your wages and social security. And the taxes on the forgiveness is more than your initial loan.

Moral of the story, find a way to pay down your loans!","Why you shouldn't use loan forgivenessSo I explained in the Dave Ramsey subreddit why he is wrong about these programs. Wrong in execution not on if you should or not. Here is why and the real reason why these programs suck.

t3_g1v91j,StudentLoans,Refinance v Consolidate,"Hi all, my wife has about $115k in parent plus loan under her dad's name. Her parents aren't the most financially literate  and were gamed in to signing up for a bunch of those to finance her undergrad degree (didn't understand that she could take out loans herself, and refused to hear anything contrary to what they wanted to do). I'm not even sure if they realize that they are liable for those loans. She make about 60k currently a year out of school and we chose to sign up for the graduated 10 yr plan and pay approx $800/mo which will increase in 2021. We want to get those loans out from under her parents. One option is to refi and take advantage of her credit to lower the interest rate and be able to claim interest paid on our taxes (currently cannot even though we are paying them). The second option is to consolidate them federally under her name (again we'd likely get a better rate). My question is should we consolidate (potentially taking advantage of an income driven plan) under the assumption that something politically has got to give over the next few years and some amount of federal debt will be forgiven, or should we refinance and loose out on any federally held benefits? Between the two of us we make about $115k after tax (I would like to avoid cosigning of possible), so a 800 a month payment now isn't a massive burden (though annoying considering we aren't really tackling any principal) but the later graduated payments certainly will be a larger percentage of our budget. We are planning to take advantage of this 0% interest period go save a chunk in a high yeild savings account and pay off as much as we can before making a decision.

TL:DR should we refinance parent plus loans or federally consolidate?","Refinance v ConsolidateHi all, my wife has about $115k in parent plus loan under her dad's name. Her parents aren't the most financially literate  and were gamed in to signing up for a bunch of those to finance her undergrad degree (didn't understand that she could take out loans herself, and refused to hear anything contrary to what they wanted to do). I'm not even sure if they realize that they are liable for those loans. She make about 60k currently a year out of school and we chose to sign up for the graduated 10 yr plan and pay approx $800/mo which will increase in 2021. We want to get those loans out from under her parents. One option is to refi and take advantage of her credit to lower the interest rate and be able to claim interest paid on our taxes (currently cannot even though we are paying them). The second option is to consolidate them federally under her name (again we'd likely get a better rate). My question is should we consolidate (potentially taking advantage of an income driven plan) under the assumption that something politically has got to give over the next few years and some amount of federal debt will be forgiven, or should we refinance and loose out on any federally held benefits? Between the two of us we make about $115k after tax (I would like to avoid cosigning of possible), so a 800 a month payment now isn't a massive burden (though annoying considering we aren't really tackling any principal) but the later graduated payments certainly will be a larger percentage of our budget. We are planning to take advantage of this 0% interest period go save a chunk in a high yeild savings account and pay off as much as we can before making a decision.

t3_g1bjfk,StudentLoans,Long Term Repayment Strategies for Large Student Loan,"I have 197k in student loans (started with 210k in Nov 2019). Assuming I do not lose my job this year (far from a guarantee), I should have it down to about 170k by January 2021. In a year or two, I will likely end up changing jobs and taking a paycut. Right now I make 190k. 

No other debt, a partner who is currently still in school but will have a decent income starting in about a year. No kids.

Would like to buy a house in the next five years or so. 

My question is simply whether it makes sense to continue throwing as much as I can at the loans when and if I take a paycut (not sure how big that paycut would be, but assume for argument's sake I go from 190k to no lower than 100k). Or, should I look into IBR + forgiveness, and try to calculate what my tax bomb would be? Any other options or strategies I'm missing?

I keep getting contradictory news.,"Hi , I have seen contradictory news ... I'm not talking about interest during Admin Forbearance which is 0% , but rather thousands of outstanding interest on my IDR Plan prior to March 13 which is on my account.  This Cares Act was put on all the accounts by Congress act , and servicers processed it as Forbearance , so it was Not a fault of borrowers to go to this status as it was applied automatically. 

Now there are contradictory news and even on servicers' post on social media and in their website that they might capitalize the outstanding interest prior to March13 on accounts after This Admin. Forbearance ends on Sep 30th which is definitely Not fair.

Lots of people on IDR plans , especially PAYE plan which is for people with financial hardship have outstanding interest on their account prior to march13 ... and since this Forbearance was automatically put on all accounts , it would Not be fair for outstanding interest to capitalize.

Also , what if you have submitted your IDR annual Recertification on time and now all the sudden your Servicer Not processing it on time by your Recertification date because of this Forbearance put in place !? ... none of these were in control of the borrowers and we should Not be penalized for that.

t3_g1j7ed,StudentLoans,How to best use 0% APR to pay off my Student Debt?,"Hi fellow borrowers and advisers! I was hoping I can get a question answered regarding a topic I hear credit savvy people use to pay off debts quicker. I heard it can be a smart move to utilize the 0% APR introductory period on a credit card to best aid in my journey to pay off my student debt. I've been reading and it looks like it can be pretty risky unless you are sure you can pay off the debt on the credit card in full by the end of the introductory period. 

Since it can be risky to transfer all my debt, can it still help to transfer a portion of it?

And if I pay off in full, is there any consequences to keeping the credit card open? I heard you shouldn't close credit cards, even if you're not using them, because it can be helpful to have that credit history still available since it establishes a line of trust.","How to best use 0% APR to pay off my Student Debt?Hi fellow borrowers and advisers!

t3_g1e4os,StudentLoans,NFCC certified counselor assigned to me says I'm doing things wrong?,"To start, I have about 100k in student loans and make about 35k a year. (I know that sucks but I'm in higher ed and the jobs are just not full time or year round so it's the best I can do for now) My husband makes somewhere between 2-3x more than me with no debt.

So my spouse and I have separate finances but we live together and have a child (and another on the way) 

My husband bought the house we live in before we were married. We live in California and have a high cost of living so expenses are high despite having one of the cheaper smaller houses available. 

We dont have a joint account we both contribute to. We both pay separate bills. He pays the mortgage and some utilities and I pay for other bills and do most of the grocery shopping etc. He doesnt tell me exactly what he makes and I dont tell him exactly what I make. We dont veto/ask each other about purchases... etc. Basically we arent comingling finances as much as we possibly can. 

We file our taxes as married filing separately. I dont report his income on my taxes and he doesn't report mine on his taxes. From my understanding this is all fine for tax purposes even though California is a community property state specifically because we don't mix our money or have knowledge of the details of each other's income.

When I have applied for income based repayment before (repaye would be a better option but I have ffel loans and havent decided if consolidating is a good idea yet)  they usually ask me to submit tax info, which I do, and then they (probably) ask if I live with my spouse and I say of course that I do, and then when they ask if I have his income information available or have any ability to get it, I check off that I do not because we dont share that information with eachother.

So that being said, we are doing our taxes ourselves this year for the first time since being married and the topic of student loans comes up and my husband wants me to look into if I am on the best repayment plan etc. I want to prepare  for and anticipate the tax bomb at the end of it and such ... so I decide to run some of the free calculators and contact the nfcc on their student loan branch to see if they have any advice on whether I should consolidate and do repaye or what... 

Well I was matched with a counseling agency and their counselor tells me I should have been reporting my spouses income all this time despite the things I mentioned above and that everyone who is married and living together for 6 months or more since 2015 has been required to report spousal income each year ... and additionally that there is some sort of cosigner form my husband should have had to sign each year before I could get on an income based plan (that doesnt make him responsible for my loans) as I mentioned I'm currently on IBR and had no issues.

I've never had the website demand my husbands info or ask him to sign anything so her reports just dont align with what I've seen. When I told her this she said lots of people have been caught for not reporting spousal income when they have to etc. And that the government loses X amount to this kind of fraudulent reporting each year etc... They did an investigation into it and decided to crack down recently... yada yada.... And that basically the department of education expects that if you are married and live together, then you have access to each other's finances and what you are required to report on taxes etc doesnt matter. Then she basically said if my husband wont tell me his income then I cant legally qualify for any income based repayment plans.

This is contrary to so many things I've read online and my own experience with the application so I didnt really know what to say. If I have to report my husbands income but he wont tell me what it is exactly... or if I convince him to tell me but our payments shoot up to an unmanageable level for our situation because of that... I dont want to assume she is correct if there is a better way, but it seems like the nfcc site assigned me to this one agency and (I asked and) she is the only student aid specialized counselor there...

t3_g1hq34,StudentLoans,Can I do 2 Separate Consolidations for Parent PLUS?,"I have 2 kids, one of them is going to be a senior in college and the has graduated and is currently working.

t3_g161a3,StudentLoans,How should I allocate student loan payments during 0% interest rate period?,"Thank you in advance for responding! Any information would be helpful. I have quite the large student loan that I have been trying to pay back. It’s been extremely slow-going and I feel like I haven’t made much progress. When the announcement was made that the interest accrual rate would be suspended until September, I thought now would be a good time to attack my loans.

I was previously using the snowball method for paying back my loans. I would have a small automatic payment spread out between all my loans but then I would throw whatever extra money I had at the loan with the highest interest rate to pay that down faster. 

So now that things have changed with the interest rate and all automatic payments have stopped, here is my question: Should I make a payment spread out across all loans or should I continue to throw all my money at the loan with the highest interest rate?

Thank you!!!

Edit: I won’t be making payments right now. My plan was to save during this time of uncertainty and just pay a lump sum in September. I was just wondering if the payment should be spread out or focused on the loan with the highest interest rate.","How should I allocate student loan payments during 0% interest rate period?Thank you in advance for responding!

t3_g19mmj,StudentLoans,"If I drop a class that was originally paid for with grad PLUS loans, do I have to send that money back?","This is kind of a confusing situation, so I will do my best to explain my predicament. I am a US graduate student in a medical profession currently living on federal loans - direct unsubsidized and grad PLUS loans. Like everyone else, my spring semester has been heavily affected by the pandemic.

So here's the situation: I am a full-time student but the curriculum worked out so I was originally signed up for 13 credit hours (rather than 15, which is full-time), so I was charged $1200 less for tuition because I was not full-time per my college. This was discovered and worked out awhile ago - my COA was less and everything was fine. Well now that we've been pulled from rotations, we were required to pick up another elective. This pushed me to 16 credit hours, which is full time. The school charged me the extra $1200, I applied for an additional grad PLUS loan to pay that off. I hope you're following me so far.

We had a mini-uprising (not really, but it's good for the drama) about paying more money to do less school, so the school allowed us to drop the additional elective. Now I'm back to the original 13 credits, and that $1200 was treated as a refund and sent to me via direct deposit.

Now my question is, am I obligated to give that money back since my COA is technically back to the original amount (which did NOT include the $1200)? I could really use the money right now, but I don't want to pay off my bills with that money and then the government turns around and demands I pay it back. Ya know? I have a LOT of loans (my degree is really stupid expensive), so piling more on top of it isn't really an issue. 

So tl;dr - if I drop a class that was already paid for with federal loans, am I required to send the money back?","If I drop a class that was originally paid for with grad PLUS loans, do I have to send that money back?This is kind of a confusing situation, so I will do my best to explain my predicament. I am a US graduate student in a medical profession currently living on federal loans - direct unsubsidized and grad PLUS loans.

t3_g0f0jq,StudentLoans,Sign the #MakeZeroPermanent Petition Now to Show Your Support for 0% Interest on All Student Loans Forever,"This is the first time I’ve been “politically active” about something in a very long time. But I think now we have a window of opportunity to move the narrative on the topic of student loan reform. We need to do something about it now.

I think outright loan forgiveness is probably too difficult a pill to swallow. But I think we can get a couple of meaningful changes done right now if we indicate to our politicians how important this is. The petition I’ve drafted calls for 2 things:

1. It calls for the government to make 0% interest on student loans permanent.

They’ve already authorized it for 6 months. It would be very easy to refinance all student loan debt right now. They are doing this for Corporate America. They should do it for our students.

2. It calls for an additional 18-month holiday on ALL student loan payments so that we hopefully ensure a smooth economic recovery after the COVID-19 Crisis.

I really don’t see what’s controversial about this proposal. I think it just needs to get done. And for that to happen, we need people to rally around this cause.

So here's the thing, I'm currently paying around $350 a month towards my outstanding balance. Unfortunately I can't afford that anymore due to current circumstances.

I'm not exactly sure what a payment reversal does; I googled it and all I got from it was that money was returned to the buyer, and I'm not sure if I'm the buyer  in this situation. Also, I fear that they will add the balance I owed for April and May to the last payment I make, which would be overwhelming. 

I'm currently leaning to just lowering my payment because the other option is too complicated, unless someone can explain what ""reversing the payments for April and May to the end of the payment schedule"" means.

What I want to make sure is that I'm still eligible for IBR. When I plug our incomes into my servicer's repayment estimator, it does look like I'd be eligible if we file separately but not jointly. I need to have a ""partial financial hardship"" but I'm having a hard time finding a simple calculator online to make sure I'm still eligible.

t3_g0plaj,StudentLoans,Taking Advantage of Forbearance Period,"This may be a non-conventional strategy, but I thought it was interesting and a good idea for the current state we are living in. As almost everyone knows, all federal loans have had their interest brought down to 0% until October as well as many will be receiving a stimulus check in the next few weeks.

Like I am sure many people that still have stable work may have thought, ""wow this a great time to attack the principal of my loans"" using the 6 months and stimulus check to put a hefty dent on their loans. This was going to be my plan as well, until I had thought of holding off any payments during the 6 months, putting them in a high yield savings account until the period is over for extra security during this unstable time. If things were still stable at that time, I can simply apply the lump sum and it would be the same as applying it over time, as well as gaining a bit of interest.

Discussing this with my wife, she thought this would delay the date of our payments. Obviously it did not, but it got me thinking to see if I can leverage this time to reduce the amount of time we are paying for.

Background on my wife and I: 65k student loans, 2 years out of school. Living in LCOL making over 120k combined. Getting married last year put a **big** dent on our savings, and we are slowly recovering (Adding $500/month). Currently with a 3-month emergency fund wanting to get to 6 months. 

TL;DR

**Strategy**: Put any money that would go toward student loans/stimulus check into emergency fund for 6 month forbearance. 

**Result**: Freed up $500/month for student loan payments approximately 1 year sooner than expected, paying off loans \~4 months earlier than if applying funds during forbearance, while expediting completion of emergency fund.

t3_g0r41v,StudentLoans,Picking a lower repayment plan to pay more on principal balance,"I’m graduating soon and picking which payment plan I’ll be on - it’s between income driven and standard. I could technically afford standard but I can’t pay much extra if I do. I want to make extra payments that are allocated to principal balance after I pay my mandatory monthly balance. I’ve heard you could type a letter to your provider with directions to do this with extra payments i.e. do not allocate across all interest but to the principal balance of the loan with highest interest rate, and then allocate to xyz, etc etc, and they will do it! 

So question # 1:

I want to pick a plan where I pay less (income driven), so I can pay more towards principal balance in the form of extra payments each month. This will reduce what I pay in the long run, right?! Its making too much sense in my head, but I don’t know of anyone else who has done this or posted about it on the internet. 

Question # 2:

Would I have this option if I consolidated or would I only be able to have this option if I have multiple loans? 

Question #3:

For now I need to pay only on the interest because that will capitalize when I start a plan no matter who the provider or what plan, correct?

t3_g08u1p,StudentLoans,What are the fiscally responsible options I have in this unique situation with financial aid?,"\[x-posting here from r/personalfinance\]

tldr at the end.

Here's the situation:

I am well into my undergrad degree and have had several complications in my disbursement of financial aid this year. My campus offices of Financial Aid, the Bursar, and the Registrar all seem very helpful, but I do not believe specific issues with my financial aid in paying for college have been fully communicated to me, nor have my steps for how to resolve them been clearly laid out or even communicated between offices. It's a frustrating situation that I believe will have a positive outcome, but I'm beginning to grow concerned about being put in a disadvantageous financial situation; especially with our current global concerns.

I transferred to my institution in the Fall of this year. I came into the Winter Quarter 4 weeks late on account of my financial aid not disbursing for Fall Quarter; the issue was that I had not completed the CSS profile, not known it to be a requirement for all students to complete, and not been able to complete it until 2 weeks after I called the office at the beginning of the quarter to register - only to find a hold on my account. I had received a few calls from the Bursar telling me about the balance and been trying to tell them that my financial aid should have already disbursed or been on its way, but I had not received any calls from the financial aid office to let me know the problem - none my aid could not disburse until I completed the CSS profile. Completing it required 3rd party documentation for my personal situation, so I assumed it to be an additional \*option\* for additional FA from College Board, and opted not to complete it out of concern for my family's privacy. Between finding out about the issue, requesting &amp; receiving documentation, and completing the profile, we were two 2 weeks into Winter Quarter. I wish I had been more proactive in discovering the issue and resolving it, but the quarter had already begun, and I registered late. The issue was on me. Receiving approval from my instructors and successfully enrolling had to be done in person and on paper at the Office of the Registrar and took another 2 weeks to finalize before I was fully enrolled.

This minor inconvenience was only the wind-up for the potentially severe issue I am running into now, bringing me to this Spring Quarter:

I went back and forth on whether or not to register for Spring Quarter. I had personal health and financial concerns about registering for this quarter. Between the financial risks of COVID-19 and everything else going on in my life, I still decided to register for online classes, only to find a near $10k outstanding balance on my account, when I had been informed by the Financial Aid office in Winter that the balance would be paid in full with the aid I was expecting; with a $2k return from the loan after payment (I'm not sure what the exact term for this is, but the balance was expected to be paid in excess of $2,000). Part of my financial aid, a federal loan, was meant to cover a majority of tuition, but the applications for it are canceled automatically by Financial Aid 4 weeks into the term for any students who have yet to register for 8 or more credits. My financial aid was completed and confirmed 2 weeks into that term, but I was not able to fully register until the mid-4th week because of some red-tape (I can elaborate on this more if anyone requests it, but it doesn't seem financially relevant, so I'm excluding it). This meant that an outstanding balance totaling near 10-grand would remain on my account from the Fall and Winter terms. Despite having been in constant communication with the Bursar for two weeks lifting my registration holds at the OoFA's request, the balance I was informed to expect full payment of would remain because most of the aid would be canceled automatically by the FA Office. I couldn't find a notice about this cancellation from the federal government or any office from the school. I was no longer receiving calls from any office for the duration of Winter term after registering. I would not have registered and accrued more debt from the term if there was no guarantee that I could pay for it; instead, I would have preferred to take the term off and resolve this issue so it didn't affect my grades (I was going to my professors' classes for the first 4 weeks, but not having access to Canvas for half the term ended up taking a chunk out of my GPA). So that's what I decided to do this term, temporarily withdraw, take some time to simplify my financial aid situation, avoid any other surprises with tuition, and come in strong next Fall Quarter (online classes are not good for my learning style, in any case). I thought I was making a sensible decision financially. Evidently, this would not be the case.

After seeing the balance at the beginning of this term and calling the Financial Aid office to see what went wrong, they discovered that one of my federal loans was scheduled to disburse for both terms, but never did. Knowing this, and not being able to register for classes, I decided to communicate the situation to my institution by submitting a temporary withdrawal until Fall 2020 and avoid incurring additional debt for the term before resolving the issue on my student account.

It was only after this point that I learned what I mentioned earlier, that one must be enrolled in 8 credits for any Federal Aid to be disbursed retroactively. It was only two weeks into this term that I learned my federal loan was canceled by the Office of Financial Aid two months ago without any institutional notice. I was registered for over 8 credits for the remainder of the term and could have corrected this issue with a retroactive disbursement had I known to ask for it, but now that I have not been registered, the deadline for a 100% tuition refund for dropped classes has passed. Meaning I can't simply lift the hold on my account, register for 8 credits, wait for my retroactive disbursement and drop the classes. Leaving me stuck between paying a 10-grand balance on my account, or &gt;50% tuition for classes I will not be taking for more than a week. I was willing to eat the monthly late fees and enroll for Summer or Fall term and have the aid disbursed then, but I have been informed by the FA office that the aid will not disburse unless I am enrolled in 8 or more credits this Spring Term. At this point, I will be missing more than 3 weeks of classes, at best.

I do not know how I could have communicated more with these offices, why I wasn't informed about this situation, why I needed to coordinate solutions to it in the style of a detective and messenger between all 3 offices instead of systems for communication existing for unique and unexpected situations like this one. Most importantly, I do not know how I can approach this situation in a financially responsible or safe way. This whole thing is seeming more like an impossible and unexpected issue, and I do not hold the offices totally at fault. It seems like an automated clerical accident and a lot of unfortunate timing. All I would like to do is take the proper steps to efficiently and finally resolve this.

My last hope will be to apply for a formal tuition appeal this week to waive the 50% fee and have the aid disburse before I withdraw. If that doesn't happen, I've been referred by the FA office directly to Sally Mae or Wells Fargo for a private loan... I never believed my institution could leave us so out in the cold like that. I can't take on the additional debt, it would be hard to swallow when we were expecting a 2-grand return from the federal loan after paying for both quarters. It's a discouraging situation, but what advice do you have for me? And what options would you recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that's around the same time that the FA office cancels financial aid requests for students who aren't registered for 8 or more credits, resulting in a surprising 2nd financial aid holdup this term and a 9k outstanding balance on my account from a canceled federal loan that I was not made aware of in the 6 weeks I was actually registered to resolve it.

tldr at the end.

Here's the situation:

I am well into my undergrad degree and have had several complications in my disbursement of financial aid this year. My campus offices of Financial Aid, the Bursar, and the Registrar all seem very helpful, but I do not believe specific issues with my financial aid in paying for college have been fully communicated to me, nor have my steps for how to resolve them been clearly laid out or even communicated between offices. It's a frustrating situation that I believe will have a positive outcome, but I'm beginning to grow concerned about being put in a disadvantageous financial situation; especially with our current global concerns.

I transferred to my institution in the Fall of this year. I came into the Winter Quarter 4 weeks late on account of my financial aid not disbursing for Fall Quarter; the issue was that I had not completed the CSS profile, not known it to be a requirement for all students to complete, and not been able to complete it until 2 weeks after I called the office at the beginning of the quarter to register - only to find a hold on my account. I had received a few calls from the Bursar telling me about the balance and been trying to tell them that my financial aid should have already disbursed or been on its way, but I had not received any calls from the financial aid office to let me know the problem - none my aid could not disburse until I completed the CSS profile. Completing it required 3rd party documentation for my personal situation, so I assumed it to be an additional \*option\* for additional FA from College Board, and opted not to complete it out of concern for my family's privacy. Between finding out about the issue, requesting &amp; receiving documentation, and completing the profile, we were two 2 weeks into Winter Quarter. I wish I had been more proactive in discovering the issue and resolving it, but the quarter had already begun, and I registered late. The issue was on me. Receiving approval from my instructors and successfully enrolling had to be done in person and on paper at the Office of the Registrar and took another 2 weeks to finalize before I was fully enrolled.

This minor inconvenience was only the wind-up for the potentially severe issue I am running into now, bringing me to this Spring Quarter:

I went back and forth on whether or not to register for Spring Quarter. I had personal health and financial concerns about registering for this quarter. Between the financial risks of COVID-19 and everything else going on in my life, I still decided to register for online classes, only to find a near $10k outstanding balance on my account, when I had been informed by the Financial Aid office in Winter that the balance would be paid in full with the aid I was expecting; with a $2k return from the loan after payment (I'm not sure what the exact term for this is, but the balance was expected to be paid in excess of $2,000). Part of my financial aid, a federal loan, was meant to cover a majority of tuition, but the applications for it are canceled automatically by Financial Aid 4 weeks into the term for any students who have yet to register for 8 or more credits. My financial aid was completed and confirmed 2 weeks into that term, but I was not able to fully register until the mid-4th week because of some red-tape (I can elaborate on this more if anyone requests it, but it doesn't seem financially relevant, so I'm excluding it). This meant that an outstanding balance totaling near 10-grand would remain on my account from the Fall and Winter terms. Despite having been in constant communication with the Bursar for two weeks lifting my registration holds at the OoFA's request, the balance I was informed to expect full payment of would remain because most of the aid would be canceled automatically by the FA Office. I couldn't find a notice about this cancellation from the federal government or any office from the school. I was no longer receiving calls from any office for the duration of Winter term after registering. I would not have registered and accrued more debt from the term if there was no guarantee that I could pay for it; instead, I would have preferred to take the term off and resolve this issue so it didn't affect my grades (I was going to my professors' classes for the first 4 weeks, but not having access to Canvas for half the term ended up taking a chunk out of my GPA). So that's what I decided to do this term, temporarily withdraw, take some time to simplify my financial aid situation, avoid any other surprises with tuition, and come in strong next Fall Quarter (online classes are not good for my learning style, in any case). I thought I was making a sensible decision financially. Evidently, this would not be the case.

After seeing the balance at the beginning of this term and calling the Financial Aid office to see what went wrong, they discovered that one of my federal loans was scheduled to disburse for both terms, but never did. Knowing this, and not being able to register for classes, I decided to communicate the situation to my institution by submitting a temporary withdrawal until Fall 2020 and avoid incurring additional debt for the term before resolving the issue on my student account.

It was only after this point that I learned what I mentioned earlier, that one must be enrolled in 8 credits for any Federal Aid to be disbursed retroactively. It was only two weeks into this term that I learned my federal loan was canceled by the Office of Financial Aid two months ago without any institutional notice. I was registered for over 8 credits for the remainder of the term and could have corrected this issue with a retroactive disbursement had I known to ask for it, but now that I have not been registered, the deadline for a 100% tuition refund for dropped classes has passed. Meaning I can't simply lift the hold on my account, register for 8 credits, wait for my retroactive disbursement and drop the classes. Leaving me stuck between paying a 10-grand balance on my account, or &gt;50% tuition for classes I will not be taking for more than a week. I was willing to eat the monthly late fees and enroll for Summer or Fall term and have the aid disbursed then, but I have been informed by the FA office that the aid will not disburse unless I am enrolled in 8 or more credits this Spring Term. At this point, I will be missing more than 3 weeks of classes, at best.

I do not know how I could have communicated more with these offices, why I wasn't informed about this situation, why I needed to coordinate solutions to it in the style of a detective and messenger between all 3 offices instead of systems for communication existing for unique and unexpected situations like this one. Most importantly, I do not know how I can approach this situation in a financially responsible or safe way. This whole thing is seeming more like an impossible and unexpected issue, and I do not hold the offices totally at fault. It seems like an automated clerical accident and a lot of unfortunate timing. All I would like to do is take the proper steps to efficiently and finally resolve this.

My last hope will be to apply for a formal tuition appeal this week to waive the 50% fee and have the aid disburse before I withdraw. If that doesn't happen, I've been referred by the FA office directly to Sally Mae or Wells Fargo for a private loan... I never believed my institution could leave us so out in the cold like that. I can't take on the additional debt, it would be hard to swallow when we were expecting a 2-grand return from the federal loan after paying for both quarters. It's a discouraging situation, but what advice do you have for me? And what options would you recommend?

However, AES is only offering a 90 day forbearance and stating that interest may still accrue during this time, and I have to request it, it's not automatically kicking in.

t3_fz5nvb,StudentLoans,Self-proclaimed PSA to high school seniors weighing expensive college options involving heavy student loan debt burdens.,"We're all obviously living in uncertain times, but one thing is certain, degrees are no longer worth today's inflated tuition prices.

Every passing semester, degrees become less valuable as a new batch of graduates enter the job market. This virus is mimicking the 2008 financial &amp; job market crash, but on steroids because *every industry &amp; every country* is affected *all at once.*

I highly recommend searching this sub for stories that students of the past have/had with soul-crushing debt loads (plus interest). If they could go back in time, they'd make different financial choices to reduce their debt loads.

The point I'm trying to make is to not repeat history by *immediately* going to a 4-year school, and taking on unnecessary debt (for the first 2 years), to which the 4-year degree is absolutely not guaranteed to land a high paying job after 4 years.

Keep your tuition &amp; debt load low by first going to Community College in order to get those BS General Education classes out of the way, then transfer to the school you want. Who knows, maybe they'll offer a better financial aid package *not involving* *~~massive~~* *loans* in the future.

If it's the social-life you're worried about, there's 2 answers to this:

* Because of this virus, now almost every University is moving to online-only classes and it's going to stay that way for quite some time. There's no point in paying 5 to 6-figures in tuition (plus fees) for a University campus you won't even physically step foot on.
* If this virus *wasn't* here, then nothing's stopping you from just physically going with your friends to a 4-year school on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights. Nobody's going to go around asking for your school ID, just to attend some weekend party with other 18-20 year olds. Besides, once they turn 21, those students usually start leaving campus to go to more mature bars &amp; clubs in the biggest city near you.

Almost every state has it's own 529 plan and provides incentives to put money into one. My state allows for a deduction of up to $4k on STATE income tax. Typically there is a 10% tax on all stock gains, but you won't be taxed on this if it is going towards education or student loans. Even if you don't end up using it for education, then you can still withdraw from it, but you will have to pay the typical tax penalty as any other investment fund.

**Things to consider:**

* I am blessed and have not been laid off so I can afford to do this, and I have emergency savings to protect me if the COVID situation gets hairier.
* Some states do not allow you to pay for student loans. Check the state's rules
* You can buy a 529 from any state, even if you don't live there or your dependents don't live there. It's likely the state you pay income tax in has the best incentives for you. Do your research before deciding on which state.
* My state 529 plan does not allow you to withdraw from the plan for the first 18 months, check to see when you can withdraw.
* I do not plan on using this money for a while so I can let the plan compound and the tax deferral compound (My plan is until I get to my lifetime student loan withdraw limit or whatever funds match the remainder of IDR plan, whichever comes first)
* The plans are invested in the stock market so you can lose money if the stock market does not do well. This is a gamble. Based on my state income, I can afford to lose approximately 5% in the market and still break even. [On average the stock market returns 10% but this is over a period of 10 years](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/average-stock-market-return/) and doubles your investment every 7 years.

Savings accounts are not good to beat inflation, but they are especially bad now. 
* The student loan interest paid for by a 529 payment cannot be used as a tax write off. 
* Student loans are now a political issue and who is to say what regulations we have a year from now, let alone 10 years from now. All in all, this is a bureaucratic gamble, but that is why a lot of us did not privatize our loans and stayed with fed loans in the first place. 
* If I don't need the money, I can gift it to other family members like my newborn niece, or withdraw from it myself and pay the tax penalty.","Beneficial to put suspended IDR payments into a 529?For those on an Income-Driven Repayment plan, it might make sense to put your suspended monthly payments into a state 529 investment fund.

t3_g0181q,StudentLoans,Refinance $115k in federal loans now or wait?,"I have 115k in graduate, federal loans. Interest rates are between 6 - 7.5%.

Pros of waiting: 1) I can continue to make payments at 0% until end of September and maybe longer if that is pushed back; 2) chance of further federal loan aid may happen in the next year or so; 3) I interest rates could continue to drop

Cons of waiting: 1) interest rates could rise and/or it becomes more difficult to obtain loans at lower interest rates as lenders tighten requirements.

Also, I'm fortunately in a position where my income will be relatively stable through any future recession, so I'm not worried about making not having access to IBR or other federal payment benefits.","Refinance $115k in federal loans now or wait?I have 115k in graduate, federal loans.

t3_fzvwny,StudentLoans,Need help deciding which loan is optimal,"Hi all,

Im currently a dental student who's managed to pay the first 2 years of school with money that I saved up. Now, I need to get a loan of $100,000 to cover the final two years. I'm trying to decide between a home equity loan, a private loan, and a governement based loan. At the end of the day, I obviously want the loan that will end up costing the least.

Can anyone advise me on what the best option is? My understanding is federal (6-7% interest) and private student (variable rate) loans have higher interest rates than home equity, but home equity loans (found one with a fixed rate at 3.24%) are not eligible as a tax deduction once I start making money? Can someone also explain what advantages and disadvantages there are to fixed vs variable rates and HELOC vs a standard home equity loan?

t3_fztdxm,StudentLoans,"Last Year of College, How Do I Save the Most Money? [Advice]","Looking for any and all advice. Obviously I can't go back in time and change how I approached college,  I can only move forward, finish my degree and then start paying these loans back. So here's a quick run down of my story so far. I attend a four year university, and will have to go this fall for a 5th year due to my major. In merit scholarships over the 4 years I saved $11,000. However, these scholarships will not renew next year as they only cover four years. 

Next, my school on average with cost of living included is \~$21,000 a year. So even just going off of that average that after this 5th year I'll be $105,000 in debt. Technically after my previous scholarships I will be down to $94,000 total in debt. All loans are my responsibility, so please don't reply below that Parent PLUS loans are not mine to worry about, because they are in my case and that was the deal I made with my parents. 

In my geographical area graduates in my major make an average $50,000 so that is a little comforting knowing I will be able to attack these loans when the time comes. This summer I will also have an internship that I should be able to make \~5,500 and don't know what I should use it for. Paying off the current interest on my loans? Tuition? Housing costs so I don't need to take out the full amount on my loan? Keep it in savings? 

Realizing how much debt this is I'm looking for ways to reduce this, or other ways I can save and cut corners or costs through this next year to try and get on top or ahead in tackling these. As well as after graduating. Currently I'm looking for lower rent apartments and also filling out scholarship applications. Also thinking I need to get an on campus job this upcoming year.

Also, sorry to add on to this, but on top of this 94,000 it's true that interest is currently accruing on these correct?

Over the last year I’ve distanced myself from so many simple pleasures. I haven’t eaten out in a year. I haven’t gone to the theater or even rented a movie. I have paused my seeking relationships. I haven’t taken a single day of PTO so that I can accrue/cashout. I budget every damn penny I earn.

It’s been an immensely sacrificial year and I am psyched that it is coming to and end soon. I believe I’ll be able to pay down my balance to at least $11,000 by the end of the month, but with the tax provisions in the CARES I might even be able to further push that figure to $9,000. 

At my current rate, I can be done by my 24th birthday in July. Good god. 24 and debt free. I am drooling at the mouth with excitement for what comes next. I know this is a bit of a boast, but frankly the effort behind this pride has my sole focus for as long as I can remember and is all I have to hold onto for the next few months.

It’s basically just a prison and people who get sent there have to stay for at least 45 days and have almost no contact with the outside world during their stay. 

I took an extra of my anxiety medication and ended up becoming really woozy and my father is somewhat convinced that I was on fentanyl again and that I had overdosed (or came close to it). I’m now worried he’s going to send me to that detox again (its extremely easy to get someone committed).

If I get sent there then best case scenario is I would be able to drop all my courses, which would suck because I have all A’s right now. Worst case scenario is that I wouldn’t even be able to drop the classes and would just have to take whatever grade I get after bombing all the remaining course work and tests.

t3_fyivzm,StudentLoans,FedLoan's message.,"On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response
to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S.
Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your
federally owned loans that we service for ED.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The
changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan
(Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program
loans. 

If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the
servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

● 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept.
30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

● Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period
March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on
your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in
place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period,
payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward
loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll
need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any
payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the
principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when
the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends.
There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed
on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly
payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of
the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept.

Harrisburg, PA 17106-9184","FedLoan's message.On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response
to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S.
Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your
federally owned loans that we service for ED.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The
changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan
(Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program
loans. 

If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the
servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

● 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept.
30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

● Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period
March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on
your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in
place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period,
payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward
loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll
need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any
payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the
principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when
the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends.
There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed
on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly
payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of
the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept.
30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not.
To opt out, let us know through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""

● If you change your mind after opting out, you can simply request that your loans be placed in the administrative
forbearance again. Contact us through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""
● If you opt out and become more than 30 days late in making a required monthly payment, we'll place your loans in
the administrative forbearance again.

t3_fyrsoj,StudentLoans,Teacher Loan Forgiveness Double Down?,"Hey everyone! So I am just finding out that part of my loan was put in default in January (lucky me). But I am in my 5th year at low income school High School as an Art teacher, so in June (end of the school year) I am looking to do the Teacher Loan Forgiveness to get it all squared away. 

Both of my student loans were from Nelnet. Apparently Group B of student loans was sent to Collection. So I owe $5300 to Nelnet (Group A) and $4750 to the new collection agency.

I asked what would happen once our account is actually updated and the rep said “the interest that has accrued will be subtracted from your account and covered by the federal government.”

t3_fyqu4b,StudentLoans,Your student loan will be forgiven,"The Covid situation, in my opinion, appears to be the pin that will pop many bubbles, including the student loan bubble. The 6 month 0% interest forbearance is just the beginning. This is a defining moment in our country's history, similar to the Great Depression. Major secular changes tend to happen not when things are going great, but when things are very bad. Recall that the New Deal, which introduced Social Security and other safety nets, etc happened shortly after the Depression.

Many of you who have been very good citizens trying to pay off your loans as quickly as possible will think this to be unfair. I don't disagree. But when times get desperate, it won't matter. In just four weeks, the US government has printed about **6 Trillion dollars**, mostly to bail out companies that made poor financial decisions (e.g., airlines that spent 96% of their cash flows into share buybacks that enriched senior executives, at the expense of a rainy day fund).

In light of all the money printing, the $1.7T of student loans outstanding seems like a drop in the bucket. The question will increasingly be asked - if we can bail out hedge funds who made poor decisions, why should't we bail out student loan debtors, who (for the most part) didn't engage in any bad faith? Additionally, this would substantially free all those making payments to take that monthly payment and use it to spend on a new car, a house, and other economy goods. It will be increasingly seen as a necessary cost.

What I'm saying is that this is the end of an 80+ year economic cycle, where money is redefined. A great debt jubilee is coming. Billionaire Ray Dalio talks about this, and I would recommend this video if you want to learn more [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

None of this is financial advice. Do what you want with your money. But in 5-10 years, you may look back on this post and wonder if anyone could have seen this coming. If you pay attention to the macro world, it's fairly clear how this all ends. Hedge accordingly.

Good luck.","Your student loan will be forgivenThe Covid situation, in my opinion, appears to be the pin that will pop many bubbles, including the student loan bubble.

I’ve been making regular on-time payments since graduating. And I briefly went into deferment at the end of the year and was scheduled to start making payments again this month today (4/9/20) . But, then Covid hit and my loans went into automatic forbearance. I’m fortunate enough to still be working during this time, So with the 0% interest thought it’d be a good idea to take advantage and start directly hitting the principle. (After paying all the accrued interest on my loans, ofc) 

I decided to make a overpayment on either the 25th or 26th, that was almost double what I typically pay to attack all my interest. I allocated the amount for each loan by adding the amount of interest owed to the monthly payment amount for every single one. For example, if my monthly payment for loan A was $25.50 and my interest on loan A was $30.50 in total I specified a payment of $56.

All the interest that was on my sub loans was paid off from me doing this but the interest on my unsub loans is still there. So I’m confused and Im scared that I did something wrong lol or that it will hurt me in the long run more than help and tbh, don’t know if what I did was a smart decision. It sounded good in my head at the time.

Thoughts? Or any general advice on what I should do now moving forward?

t3_fxv4h9,StudentLoans,"Student loans, CARES act, and the opt-out forbearance: pay attention to capitalization!","As anticipated after passage of the CARES act, I received an e-mail from Great Lakes this morning notifying me that my federal student loans have been placed into administrative forbearance until Sep. 30th and that I am accruing 0% interest. I have about $7k in outstanding interest from pre-March 13th when the rates went to 0%. Their e-mail includes the following statement:

&gt;If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance.

This is misleading. I called this morning and specifically asked whether or not my existing interest balance would capitalize, and Great Lakes verified that **it will capitalize when the forbearance ends.**

I told the representative that I spoke with that I feel like the statement in the e-mail is misleading and Great Lakes may be opening themselves up to liability. Waiting to see if that makes it to their legal department and if we'll be getting an updated e-mail.

Also note that I have heard from friends, anecdotally, that their providers have told them that their interest will NOT capitalize. If you are affected by this automatic forbearance, you should check with your provider to see what's happening with your existing interest.

If you plan to utilize the PSLF, this is probably a moot point since you only need to make ten years of income-driven payments and then the principal and any outstanding interest is forgiven. Capitalized interest will not affect your monthly payments. However, although I am in a career that makes me theoretically eligible for PSLF, I am personally worried that a future administration could eliminate the program. Because of that, I do not want my interest to capitalize and I opted out of the forbearance as I have the ability to pay.

t3_fxdlnd,StudentLoans,90k in student loans.,"Hi everyone,

I just got admitted into a nursing school. However, it is very expensive with tuition being 60k for the whole program and 15k worth of housing for the 16 months id be in school. Additionally, I need money to live so I was thinking of living off of 800$ a month so about 13k for the 16 months. This means i would need about 90k worth of loans. I understand this is a crazy high amount, but i would graduate a semester earlier than planned because it is an accelerated program, it has a 100% NCLEX pass rate which is VERY good and the location of the school works perfect for me since my cousin goes to school in the same city so my family and I go often to visit him so I know the city well. Starting pay for nurses in Texas is 60-70k depending on the city.

I just got admitted into a nursing school. However, it is very expensive with tuition being 60k for the whole program and 15k worth of housing for the 16 months id be in school. Additionally, I need money to live so I was thinking of living off of 800$ a month so about 13k for the 16 months. This means i would need about 90k worth of loans.

t3_fxvb81,StudentLoans,Navient math just plain wrong on loan repayment details?,"I got an email from Navient that some student loans have been affected by the recent Covid-19 related legislation, so I logged into to check my loan.  I've been on autopay ($196.32/mo) for a long time and log in periodically, but I've never looked at the math closely.

Here are the details.  I have two loans consolidated into one monthly payment.

Here's what my account details page has:

* Loan 1: FFELP - Consolidated
* Balance: $5991.85
* Interest Rate: 4.0%
*Monthly Payment: $144.08
* Term: 72 months (3/2026 last payment)
* Total Amount Paid: $10,373.76


* Loan 2: FFELP - Consolidated
* Balance: $2171.18
* Interest Rate: 4.0%
* Monthly Payment: $52.24
* Term: 72 months (3/2026 last payment)
* Total Amount Paid: $3761.28

If you use the balance/term/interest for Loan #1, it comes out to a monthly payment of $93/mo (not $144).  If you do the same for Loan #1, it comes out to $33.98/mo (not $52).  So in theory, I should be paying ($93+$34) $127/mo instead of $196.  This would also make my total amount paid over the 72 months go from $14135.04 to $9197.28, saving me almost $5000!

I called Navient and the service rep was unable to explain to me why the math wasn't adding up.  She said that she could put in a request to have a calculation explanation physically mailed to me, but I'm not sure how quickly that request will happen, or what reasonable explanation they could possibly have.

What's going on here?  Are there extra amounts I'm paying that aren't shown?  Is the interest rate not really accurate?  I'm at a loss, and just would like to know if anyone else has any experience with anything like this.  I'm financially OK with the $196/mo payment, so my thought is that I should keep that payment and just be done with the loan much quicker than 6 years (just under 4 years!), or I could keep the lower monthly payment and save myself $70/month.

My loans appear on my credit report, but they have zero effect because of my deferred status.

I called Mohela to see if I can defer another 6 months and they said that I have to wait for a bill to come in the mail and then they can evaluate my options.

   
 

To sum up, my loans ($19,000) go into a repayment status on June 14th. 

How soon after June 14th does my credit report show this change?

Will my credit score drop much?

t3_fxi5cb,StudentLoans,Best option for funding accelerated nursing program?,"My daughter will graduate from a major state university in May with a BS in HDFS and roughly $20k in federal student loans, the rest having been paid in cash by her mother and I.

Upon graduation she will be rolling directly into the fifteen month accelerated nursing program at the same university, at a cost of roughly $35k. This will be paid entirely by her, as we will be starting to pay for her younger sibling in the fall.

The federal aid package is fairly dismal, only $6k in unsubsidized loans offered. Frankly I’m surprised that with a sibling entering college she would not qualify to borrow the full cost of the tuition. The program is not graduate level so she does not qualify for grad plus. Also should mention that apparently there will be no federal aid available for the summer term because the program only schedules 11 credit hours.

It seems like our only option is to find a private loan and I will have to cosign, which I would do but am not really thrilled about. Am I missing anything here, and if not - can anyone recommend a private lender for this situation?

t3_fwxp39,StudentLoans,Ways to get Fedloan to remove Late Payments,"Hi- 

I posted this to Personal Finance but figured this might be a good forum to get help. Sooooo rewind a few years I graduated from a very expensive private university a little over two years ago. I was unaware of how important credit is and repaying loans were. I made some money from my first real job- thought I was going to be able to not pay the piper and simply dug my head in the sand with respect to my student loans (private university loan and FedLoan loan(s)). 

  
After pulling my head out of my ass and trying to be financially responsible and being tired of dodging Fedloan and my school loans. I finally picked up and decided to confront my responsibilities. Literally nine months ago I entered student loan rehabilitation with my **university** and made accelerated payments to bring my account current. In doing this, my credit score shot up from 502 to 570, still waiting on Equifax to update their records as well...but should be in the same ballpark at TransUnion.  While I was rehabbing my student loans through my university, I brought my FedLoan current but having 2 missed payments amongst 13 loans equated to 26 late payments tanking my score in the first place (my fault...I get it). 

  
So now that my university credit report is golden, I've been trying to tackle my on-time FedLoan account and trying to either come up with a solution where they could remove my 26 lates from my credit report- making it seem as if they were never there. I've read about requesting a retroactive forbearance and also a Goodwill Letter to request to remove my late payments. Does anyone have any advice on how to get my lates removed with FedLoan?   


I understand that achieving a great credit score is a marathon, not a sprint- but I am trying and have made responsible decisions to get back on track!

Guys, I have a loan with Sallie Mae and I just sent in my payment of $253 that was due on the 3rd of April.

I'm so confused because from what the contract states, late fees are supposed to be 5% of what was past due. Now they're saying I now owe $507? 

I'm hoping it's because they added next month's payment but the fact that it's saying the $507 is the ""Total Amount Due"" is making me think otherwise.

Is this an error? Should I just pay the other $258 accrued interest now?

My gut says no because of how a standard forbearance works. During a standard forbearance you do not get any credit towards PSLF. Since my financial situation is unchanged by COVID-19, I figured it did not make sense to participate in the forbearance because it will only extend my time till forgiveness by six months. That only means six months of higher payments at the end for me and it sounds like I would be trading dollars for nickels.

t3_fvk73u,StudentLoans,Mission: Complete. I finished paying my loans!,"I finished undergrad with a loan balance that totaled about $8500. (My mother told me she would pay for undergrad, then I graduated and learned that she took loans in my name. She then said she would pay them back and didn't.) Most of the loan debt is debt I took in my own name, however. The short story is that I borrowed a shit load of money at 21 and 22 to pursue a degree (MLIS) with an extremely low ROI because a) I assumed I would always work for a PSLF eligible employer and b) I had no real intention to pay the money back in full. In retrospect, this was an extremely stupid and childish action to take, and it reflected my lack of life experience as much as my ignorance about the real world impact of owing so much money plus interest. 

After I realized my hellish mistake, I got out of the library field, into another related, more lucrative and employable field, paid my way through a second masters program while paying my living expenses, working a full time job in my field, and taking advantage of my in-school deferral to pay down my existing loans. Those years were extremely stressful, and I was pretty broke for all of them. However, the outcomes of those actions were well worth the hassle. When I started the second masters program in January 2016, I had 6 loans outstanding. When I finished in May 2019 (with no additional debt), I had 2. In November of 2018, I got an offer for my current job, for which I moved across country (again) and at which I got a 51% raise from my previous position. I threw all that money into the pit of despair that is Navient and did what I think is a commendable job with not letting lifestyle creep occur. Last Monday, March 30th, the final payment of $307.40 hit my account. I am now paid in full! 

It required a lot of drive and grind to get this done. In addition to always having a full time job, I worked a side job (one foot still in the library world). I have not owned a car in 9 years, and I had room mates for 10.5 years. I don't have any pets or kids, and I consider myself extremely lucky that I don't want either, loan debt or not, because I don't think I could have afforded them. I do not own property, and I have no down payment money saved. I cook all my meals at home, and everything I own is secondhand from either eBay or Goodwill. I churned credit cards to take vacations (including my loan payments, tuition payments, and rent), which were always done on a shoestring budget even considering the reduced cost, and I sold back PTO when I was able. This sub was a huge source of motivation, as were several people in my offline life. Hell of a time to complete the mission, but nonetheless I'm thrilled that it's FINALLY OVER.

Lastly, I downloaded the transaction history for my account but am not emotionally ready to see how much I paid including interest. The total principal of all my seven loans was $57,876. All of them were federal, and the interest rates were: 7.9% (Grad PLUS x1), 6.8% (x5), and 5.6% (x1).","Mission: Complete.

t3_fvwdr2,StudentLoans,From Navient,"On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your federally owned loans that we service for ED. 

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 

First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020. 

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program loans. If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options. 

We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

• 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

• Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO 

Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends. 

There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept. 30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not. 

To opt out, let us know through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""

• If you change your mind after opting out, you can simply request that your loans be placed in the administrative forbearance again. Contact us through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US."" 

• If you opt out and become more than 30 days late in making a required monthly payment, we'll place your loans in the administrative forbearance again.

HOW TO CONTACT US

t3_fw1njl,StudentLoans,How would you handle the CARES act with my debts?,"Hi everyone,
I’m just curious what my plan of attack should be for my loan situation. I graduated in 2018 with ~98k and have gotten it down to 72k (70 in federal subsidized/unsubsidized, 2k in private)

My payment for the 72k (there’s like 11 loans so I won’t list them all but they range from 3.4-5.7%) is low because I was focusing on paying off other things and trying to pay off my private loan. Since the CARES act is 0% interest, should I take the money I am using on federal loans and put it towards the private loan(interest is 6.1%), or should I keep making my federal payments and let it payoff some of the principal? Mathematically, I guess using the money towards my private loan makes more sense but I guess I’m just looking for confirmation from others to see if it’s a good idea. I feel like I’m missing out on some benefits if I don’t keep paying my federal loans.","How would you handle the CARES act with my debts?Hi everyone,

t3_fweeg0,StudentLoans,America's student debt 'crises',"I saw a post on Reddit that got a lot of up votes about cancelling doctors student debt, not the first I've seen but the most 'wtf' ones I've seen since from Google, doctors earn 3 times more than their Australian counterparts so $350k in debt for a $300k a year salary is nothing. What's this idea with cancelling student debt?

For context, I live in Australia, I went to uni and I'm in debt. I decided to take that on and when looking at further study, I looked at what wouldn't give me crazy amounts of debt. Hardly anyone here I've met cries for debt cancellation because we bought it on ourselves. But Australia has a system where we don't have to pay it back until we earn a certain amount which I thought America didn't have but when I asked on Reddit, someone told me the Government does have a debt system? I understand that everyone is not on this system but wouldn't a better idea to just be take on everyone's loans and do the same thing Australia does? The average American has 30k in student debt, I'd say it's similar to Australia, I'm going to be 44k in debt that I'll be paying for years. The thing is, if you did CS or medicine or engineering, even if your debt is higher than Australia, they make waaaay more than they do here. You can start of in silicon valley with 200k+ per year, that's like someone hitting their peak here.

Can someone help with my confusion? I just don't see the need to 'cancel' student debt, maybe some refinancing but that's about it which from what I've seen is/has being done. I could rack up 100k in student debt too but then asking for it to be payed off just...doesn't sound right","America's student debt 'crises'I saw a post on Reddit that got a lot of up votes about cancelling doctors student debt, not the first I've seen but the most 'wtf' ones I've seen since from Google, doctors earn 3 times more than their Australian counterparts so $350k in debt for a $300k a year salary is nothing.

t3_fvo6x1,StudentLoans,Should I spend all my savings on going to college?,"Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college *and* to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually **not** a very good thing?

My boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me *before* I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to &lt;$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I *recieved* it in the year which would affect my aid.  

My feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.

• I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.

It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, *and* emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.

t3_fus878,StudentLoans,Updated guidance for defaulted FFEL loans - COVID,"I'll update the stickied post too but for visability I wanted to create a new one.

The ED issued a new announcement around 2 AM.  Most of it applies to schools but what they did do is give the non-federally held FFEL holders of defaulted loans guidance to cease all collections until 9/30 - just like they did for the federally held loans.  The announcement is long and as I said most applies to schools so here's the relevant FFEL parts

FFEL Program: Lenders and Guaranty Agencies and Loans held by the Department Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements (§ 682.200(b))
The FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of six consecutive, on-time voluntary full monthly payments required to re-establish his or her eligibility for assistance under Title IV of the HEA.

A FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment a borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of three consecutive, on-time voluntary full monthly payments required to establish eligibility to consolidate a defaulted loan.

Borrowers in In-School Loan Status (§ 682.209(a)) and In-School Deferment Status (§ 682.210)
The loan holder should continue to report to NSLDS as “in-school” the loan status of each borrower who was in an “in-school” status on the date the borrower’s attendance at the institution was interrupted due to the COVID-19 national emergency. The loan holder should continue the borrower in that loan status until the institution reports the borrower as withdrawn.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (§ 682.410)
Guaranty agencies must stop collection activities on defaulted loans until September 30, 2020, on all federally held loans. Collection activities must resume at the end of the period at the point at which they were discontinued. The guaranty agency must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Payments to Rehabilitate Defaulted Loans (§ 682.405)
The FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment the borrower fails to make as an interruption in the nine on-time voluntary full monthly payments within ten months for purposes of rehabilitating the defaulted loan.

EDIT - there was another notice that came out early morning - it gives the non-federally held Perkins and FFEL holders the OPTION of offering 0% interest and the cessation of payments for six months mirroring the federally held loans.  The notice instructs borrowers to contact their schools (for perkins) and loan holders (for non defaulted, non federally held FFEL) for more info.  I am hearing chatter that at least one FFEL lender is considering doing the 0% interest but we'll have to see.","Updated guidance for defaulted FFEL loans - COVIDI'll update the stickied post too but for visability I wanted to create a new one.

t3_fv84bj,StudentLoans,Insights/opinions needed on repaying my loans ?," Hey guys,   
 

I got a job this year and planning to start paying back my undergrad/grad school loans.  I have \~68k in Stafford loans (where 3k is accrued interest and 65k is principal. I also have \~13k in Graduate Plus loans (where 1k is accrued interest and 12k is principal).   
 

Which one should I start paying first ? I am reading on the great lakes website, that they apply that payment to the highest interest loans first. Is that automatic or do I have to choose that option ?   
 

I am planning to set up automatic payments of 1k every month and maybe pay extra if I get more money from side jobs/tax refunds/family donations and such. Can I do that?   
 Also my company throws about 5k for free at my 401k at the end of April alongside my own personal contribution and their matching ( so I total about 7-8k every year of 401k money). Is it a good idea to take that money out from the 401k (and pay the penalty from withdrawing it ) and apply that amount towards my loans or no ? Is that a recommended strategy ?   
 

Also I keep getting this tuition refinance letters in my mailbox from Sallie Mae and some other companies. Seems like interest rates are lower compared to the original lender. Should I switch to any of them ? What are some upsides and downsides of switching to Sallie Mare or the likes of it?   
 

From your own personal experience, what is a good way to pay student loans ? What strategy did you follow?   
 

I would love your insights and opinions.

t3_fv07fa,StudentLoans,CARES- Employer Student Loan Payment,"I searched for this topic and saw a few posts mentioning it, but not really much information-

I work for a small business. My employer recently mentioned that he had read the CARES Act includes a tax break for employers who pay student loans for their employees (up to ~$5000). I told him I had read that too (but didn’t think my company would go for it). He told me to look into it and research the benefits to the company and to myself.

First off, I pay like $12000 in student loans per year, so this would only cover part of it. Also, when doing my taxes this year, I did get some money back in the interest paid. 

He indicated that the employer would pay me a lower salary if we were to start this benefit. I already get paid a pretty low salary.

I guess I’m just wondering if this would really make a difference for me and if anyone has any experience with employer payment of student loans generally or even any experience with this new law and whether it is difficult for employers to set up.

t3_fus9tg,StudentLoans,New guidance issued for Perkins - COVID,"In the late night April 4th guidance, the ED also provided for some relief for non-federally held Perkins loans.  It is as follows:

Federal Perkins Loan Program

Borrowers in Repayment (§ 674.33)
The Department authorizes institutions to grant forbearance, for a period not to exceed three months, to a Federal Perkins Loan borrower who is in repayment and who is unable to make payments due to a COVID-19 related interruption.

For an institutionally held Perkins Loan, interest accrues during any period of forbearance. A borrower may request this forbearance orally or in writing and is not required to submit documentation to be considered eligible for this forbearance. An institution must document the forbearance in the borrower’s file. To receive forbearance beyond the three-month period, the borrower must make a request to the institution and provide supporting documentation. (At the expiration of the three-month period, the institution should examine the borrower’s situation to determine potential eligibility for an economic hardship deferment or unemployment deferment, as appropriate.) This period of forbearance is counted toward the three-year maximum limit on the number of years of forbearance that may be granted to a borrower.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (Part 674, Subpart C—Due Diligence)
The institution may stop collection activities through September 30, 2020 upon notification by the borrower, a member of the borrower’s family, or another reliable source that the borrower has been affected by the COVID-19 national emergency. Collection activities must resume when the period ends. The institution must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements on Defaulted Loans (§ 674.2)
An institution should not treat any scheduled payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of six on-time, consecutive, monthly payments required for the borrower to make satisfactory repayment arrangements on a defaulted Perkins Loan and to re-establish their eligibility for assistance under Title IV of the HEA. If the Department does not extend the effective period for the temporary relief provided by this guidance, the required sequence of qualifying payments resumes at the point at which it was discontinued.

Payments to Rehabilitate Defaulted Loans (§ 674.39)
An institution should not treat any scheduled payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of nine on-time, consecutive, monthly payments required for the borrower to rehabilitate the defaulted loan. If the Department does not extend the effective period for the temporary relief provided by this guidance, the required sequence of qualifying payments resumes at the point at which it was discontinued.","New guidance issued for Perkins - COVIDIn the late night April 4th guidance, the ED also provided for some relief for non-federally held Perkins loans.  It is as follows:

Federal Perkins Loan Program

Borrowers in Repayment (§ 674.33)
The Department authorizes institutions to grant forbearance, for a period not to exceed three months, to a Federal Perkins Loan borrower who is in repayment and who is unable to make payments due to a COVID-19 related interruption.

For an institutionally held Perkins Loan, interest accrues during any period of forbearance. A borrower may request this forbearance orally or in writing and is not required to submit documentation to be considered eligible for this forbearance. An institution must document the forbearance in the borrower’s file. To receive forbearance beyond the three-month period, the borrower must make a request to the institution and provide supporting documentation. (At the expiration of the three-month period, the institution should examine the borrower’s situation to determine potential eligibility for an economic hardship deferment or unemployment deferment, as appropriate.) This period of forbearance is counted toward the three-year maximum limit on the number of years of forbearance that may be granted to a borrower.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (Part 674, Subpart C—Due Diligence)
The institution may stop collection activities through September 30, 2020 upon notification by the borrower, a member of the borrower’s family, or another reliable source that the borrower has been affected by the COVID-19 national emergency. Collection activities must resume when the period ends. The institution must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements on Defaulted Loans (§ 674.2)
An institution should not treat any scheduled payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of six on-time, consecutive, monthly payments required for the borrower to make satisfactory repayment arrangements on a defaulted Perkins Loan and to re-establish their eligibility for assistance under Title IV of the HEA. If the Department does not extend the effective period for the temporary relief provided by this guidance, the required sequence of qualifying payments resumes at the point at which it was discontinued.

t3_fuw3u5,StudentLoans,600k Student Loan Question,"Hi All!

I'm graduating from dental school and the student debt is unfortunately racked me up to $600,000 at an average interest rate of 6.5% (Very daunting I know). I feel like REPAYE is my only option at this point, given the sizable debt that I'm in. I have a relatively good understanding of it, but I'm not understanding how the governmental interest subsidy plays into forgiveness after 25 years.

From what I understand, the government subsidizes 50-100% of accrued interest on monthly payments for the time you are making REPAYE programs. But if the loan is not entirely paid for after 25 years and the loan is subsequently forgiven, are those 25 years of government-subsidized interest payments then tacked back onto the “income received” thereby making you responsible for the remaining balance AND 25 years of interest payment?

t3_fu9jmz,StudentLoans,Non COVID related question - does anyone else plan on continuing to pay the minimum under IBR and pay the taxes at the end of 30 years?,"I have nearly $200k in debt from higher education, all govt loans serviced by My Great Lakes. I am single with no other debt. Under a normal plan, my monthly payments would be ~$2500. My take home is $5k/mo. Between paying rent in a high cost of living area, trying to save for retirement, saving for a home, a car, etc. that doesn't a lot left at the end of the month. So for the last few years I've been on IBR paying ~$700/mo.

Common advice from r/personalfinance and others would say pay your debt first and then invest in your retirement. But if I were to follow that advice, 30 years later when I'm in my 60s I'll be debt free with no nest egg and with less upward mobility in my career. It seems to make more sense that I continue to pay the bare minimum and take the rest of it and invest in my Roth IRA, index funds, etc. And 30 years later when my loans are forgiven, I'll just pay taxes on the income bracket I'm bumped up into which I can also save for.

Has anyone else thought of this plan? I'm looking for a sanity check and seeing if I'm missing anything.

t3_fukl0p,StudentLoans,What are the options for a student loan with bad credit and no co-signers.,I probably know the answer to this but might as well ask. My girlfriend has run out of options to be able to continue her education right now. She has no family to help her get a student loan and she herself has bad credit. A year ago we looked for student loans and personal loans of all kinds and got nothing. She is in school because of a scholarship but messed up in the beginning which set her back drastically. She’s fixed her act but it seems to be too late. The military was an option but she doesn’t meet the physical requirements as she has to lose weight and won’t be able too do so in the required time. She told me today that she might drop out and work to fix her credit but I’m hoping there’s something or maybe advice that anyone of you would know to help keep her going for another 3 semester to get her degree.

t3_fuhu2j,StudentLoans,My prospective student loan debt has me unable to decide where to go to college,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or if my posting will help me at all, but I feel like I just needed to write out what I'm going through right now.

I'm making this post today because I'm currently a senior in high school whose having a difficult time picking a college due to financial reasons. Here is some key information about my situation:

* I come from a pretty low income family (only my dad works and he makes around \~40k a year)
* I will have to pay for all of my net costs for college through private and federal loans
* I want to major in business, specifically Marketing, and my dream is to work in the fashion industry
* I think? I want to eventually go back to school for my MBA

I currently have three options for schools: School A is my cheapest option (in-state school), and my net cost is around $10,000 a year. School B is my most expensive option at $37,000 a year. I have not received my financial aid package from School C yet, but I predict my costs will be about $30,000 a year.

At first glance, the answer seems obvious: School A. However, I was rejected from business and only accepted for general studies. It's notoriously difficult to transfer into the major you want, especially business. In order to be a competitive applicant, I'd have to get a near perfect GPA, be involved in 3 organizations, hold a leadership position, and take on an internship during a break, all while also doing my work study. As much as I'd like to believe that anything is possible with hard work, I can't help but think that I'm going to fail. I don't even know what else I'd want to do if I didn't get in. School A also has basically no relation to fashion, so I feel like I'd be giving up on my dream. I think if I went here, I would just be absolutely miserable.

On the other hand, School B accepted me directly into their business school (a top ten 10 business school). I was also admitted to their honors college, as well as receiving benefits as a scholarship recipient. I've visited and loved the business program, and they even have an apparel merchandising minor I'd love to take. Additionally, even if fashion doesn't work out for me, I think a degree from this school would provide the best job prospects in other industries. However, even with a scholarship, I'm looking at almost $150,000 in loans by the time I'd graduate. All my friends have told me that School B seems like the best option, but I feel like they don't understand what the burden of such debt truly entails.

Lastly, School C is probably my dream school. It's located in New York City, so I think that it would give me the best chance at making it in the fashion industry. They have a ton of organizations that sound really interesting to me, so I could see myself getting really involved and growing my passion. I'm also not a huge fan of big school culture (like tailgates, games, rushing, etc.), so I think School C would be ideal. However, job security seems less stable as its such a specialized school, and living expenses would be extremely high. After graduation, I'd probably be around $120,000 in debt.

I'm going to call School B's financial aid office soon to see if they can offer me more aid, but I'm not counting on it. I'm also trying to find outside scholarships, but I don't know how much that is going to help either. I'm just completely devastated right now, and I feel like I'm stuck in a trap. Everyday I've been thinking of everything I regret. I should've applied for Questbridge, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I should've applied to more safeties, but I thought School A would take me for sure. I should've applied to private universities that give good aid, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I wish I could redo my senior year. I think I know that the best thing to do would be going to School A, but I just can't bring myself to accept it.

If anyone has read this far, thank you for listening, and any advice would be greatly appreciated because I am so lost.","My prospective student loan debt has me unable to decide where to go to collegeHello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or if my posting will help me at all, but I feel like I just needed to write out what I'm going through right now.

2. I started teaching recently and had not completed the paperwork for PSLF. I made sure to put my payments in IBR, but again the paperwork for verification Of employment has not been completed.

t3_fug59y,StudentLoans,"CARES act, unpaid interest, automatic forbearance --&gt; capitalization after 6 months?","CARES act introduced and backdated to 3/13/20 to help borrowers for student loan debt relief. My take on it is that  all borrowers will have automatic forbearance x6 months. 0% interest during this time.

Great right? But doesn't end of forbearance typically trigger capitalization?

Example: Some of us have principal (let's say 100k for this example) and unpaid interest (let's say 33k)

100k (principal) + 33k (unpaid interest)

\-------&gt; x6 months of 0% interest (from 3/13/20)

At the end of the forbearance (\~9/13/20) if capitalization were to occur:

the loan becomes 133k (new principal) which derives interest from a higher principal (the 33k of interest now starts accumulating more interest).

Seems very unfair if forbearance is mandatory if this does trigger a capitalization event.

It has just been updated to 0.00% interest. My loan title is DL Consolidated-Unsubsidized and the type is Direct and current owner is US Department if Education. 

It was originally three parent plus loans that were consolidated into one but it’s still a federal loan and I qualify for the other federal repayment plans. But since it’s been consolidated, would that mean that I don’t qualify for it? I just lost my job due to the virus and have other private loans so it’d be a major help if it was.

t3_ftxr5a,StudentLoans,PAYE vs REPAYE,"So, I know this has been beaten to death in some ways, but I was curious for some input on my situation. I feel I have a reasonable grasp of both plans. I'm a graduating medical student and my spouse has no debt.

Due to the size of my loans, we have to pursue an income-based plan since standard repayment plans are beyond our capacity during residency. 

**The debt:** 255k at 6.3%, all federal loans. 

**My debt priority**: pay a doable amount during residency (5 years) but then pay it off quickly (2-3 years) as an attending with the ultimate goal to pay my entire loan amount. I will still do PSLF paperwork (as I will be at a non-profit hospital) but won't necessarily count on that happening. 

My wife intends to keep working and most advice that I am reading says to go with PAYE due to the ability to file taxes separately and then only make payments based on my salary. This effectively would lower the monthly payments. 

Alternatively, REPAYE would count our combined income no matter our filing status and therefore have higher monthly payments -- but still have the benefit of interest assistance. 

**All that said -- and help correct me if I am missing something -- since I intend to pay off the debt and** ***not*** **pursue debt forgiveness then is there any reason that I** ***shouldn't*** **pursue REPAYE? This would allow the simplicity and tax benefits of filing jointly and still reduce the total amount of interest negative amortization that will occur during residency.

t3_ftvnh3,StudentLoans,Got a federal loan refund and not sure what to do with it?,"Hi Reddit!

(I’m posting on mobile- sorry for any formatting issues) 

I’m in a bit of a predicament. I’m a college senior and like many other college students, I was sent home in March due to COVID-19. My school altered our tuition/room and board bill to reflect this change. 

Because of this, I got a loan refund of approx $2500. This refund was from my federal loans (subsidized and unsubsidized). I have approx. $52k in student loans (oof) outside of this. These loans are federal and institutional aid through my school. The federal ones will start to be due in November. The institutional loans aren’t due until June 2021. I haven’t graduated yet so I’m not sure what my monthly payment(s) will be. 

My question for this subreddit is: what do I do with this money? Should I pay it all in one chunk towards my federal loans the second I can, since that’s where they came from? Or should I split it over time into my monthly payments once they begin to take pressure off of myself? How can I avoid paying the most interest in the long run??

The loans I am being refunded are as follows: 
Federal Direct Subsidized Loan: $1,815
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: $659

Sorry if this was confusing at all- I’m still learning about all of this and navigating the “real” world! 

Thanks everyone! Any advice is greatly appreciated.","Got a federal loan refund and not sure what to do with it?Hi Reddit!

I’m 23 years old for context. I have a full time job (for now) making ~$3000 monthly. I have ~$29,000 in student loan debt (all federal) and currently paying $360/month ($30 more than the minimum). Also, I already have $3600 in emergency cash too (which should be enough for 3 months if I were to lose my job). 

I just opened a Roth IRA account (employee doesn’t have a 401k plan) and I can’t decide whether I should go all in on investing in the markets while they are down SO much OR double down on my student loans since it’s 0% interest rate right now bc of COVID-19 and I would be paying only on principal. 

In the long-run, do people think it’s better to:

A. Invest higher percentage of income into Roth IRA (put off student loan payment for this time)
B. Put all of money into student loans instead since it’s all on principal
C. Combo of paying student loan minimum and investing some % of income into Roth IRA.

I’m sure there’s not 1 right answer to this but I wanted to see what people think the best move is during this crazy time. Thank you so much in advance!","Invest in Roth IRA or double down on student loans during COVID-19 crisis?Hello reddit, this is my first post but I haven’t been able to find sound advice on this topic so I wanted to throw it out there for all of the personal finance folks out there.

t3_ftiu5i,StudentLoans,"Not sure if this is actually a loan or just a payment agreement, but I have a question about it","Ok, this may get long and convoluted, so I apologize in advance. A few years ago, my wife decided to go to college to get her Bachelors from a large online private “not for profit” school where the classes are done one at a time in an extremely accelerated manner of approximately one per month. A bit after a year (and having taken a few interspersed months off due to external needs), she reached out to Financial Aid to see why they hadn’t sent her expense disbursement (where they send you money for books etc) as expected. They came back telling her that she wasn’t going to be getting one, because when they looked at her account, she was actually going to be short about $1,000 for her current class, and that she wasn’t eligible for the next loan disbursement until after the next class, which they would require her to pay both the shortage and the next class fee before the first day of class, to the tune of approximately $2500. When she questioned it, she was told her 2 options were to either pay it, or drop out. Nevermind that (at least in our opinion) Fin Aid was responsible for this error, not us. I think it’s completely reasonable to assume that they should be keeping track of the finances to ensure that the student stays in compliance with federal student loan laws. In the end, she ended up having to drop out obviously, since we don’t have that kind of money to burn, and they adjusted things, and said that she owed around $1200 when all was said and done (part of the grants and loans had to be sent back due to enrollment level when recalculated). They kept trying to make her pay the entire amount at once for probably about a year, before they finally “relented” and allowed her to do a payment plan (of $150 a month, they wouldn’t accept anything less). We paid that for about 6 months, and then had to stop because we just couldn’t afford to keep paying. 

My question is this, without them suing her and getting a court order, can they seize our tax refund since it’s not a federally backed loan (again, if it’s really even a loan)?","Not sure if this is actually a loan or just a payment agreement, but I have a question about itOk, this may get long and convoluted, so I apologize in advance.

t3_fthxwz,StudentLoans,Looking for advice on my next move,"So I am lucky enough to still be employed during this pandemic with a steady job for a nonprofit hospital. I am currently on a Standard Repayment Plan with MyFedLoan with the hopes to eventually utilize the PSLF after 120 payments.

Should I continue making scheduled payments each month or request forbearance through september and then continue making payments again?

If I do request forbearance will I not be able to qualify for PSLF as I had originally planned?

t3_ft64xk,StudentLoans,Settle student loan during COVID-19,"Hi! Please don’t judge me. I’m looking for advice on how to fix this and my anxiety and guilt is already enough. 

A private loan I took out in 2007 was deferred shortly after graduating in 2008. Long story short: My stepdad had co-signed for it, and I had been sending him payments while I lived/taught abroad, but my mom told me to stop sending him money since he wasn’t paying on the loans and was hoping to file for bankruptcy. Stepdad and I had a huge falling out afterwards. By the time I was back on my feet I wasn’t able to locate where the loan was. 

Recently my estranged stepdad sent a pack of mail and in it was a letter from that student loan (With American Coradius Int’l). They want to settle the debt. Right now it’s at $41,719.07 They offered to settle at 20,880.00 over 24 months. 

I want to pay for it since my stepdad is on the line for it as well. I’m curious if/how Coronavirus has changed the rules of negotiation. I’d rather not drain my savings, but if I could probably settle for half or so of what they’re asking, I might be able to do that while still leaving enough for emergencies. 

Do you think I could offer a full payment for less to get rid of the loan? I’m currently unemployed for the foreseeable future and I live abroad.

t3_ft9hy3,StudentLoans,My partner (American) and I (Canadian) both got emails about our student loans this week,"NSLS emailed to tell me they automatically stopped all Canadian student loan payments with no interest accrued until September (phew!)

In contrast, my partner was just “approved” for is a $224 USD monthly payment increase. It’s still not enough to cover the monthly interest accrued, so the loan just keeps growing. 

She phoned and was (thankfully) told student loan payments are also being held in the US without interest until September, so she won’t have to pay the increase until then. Sadly, she also got news yesterday that she is being laid off from one of her jobs due to COVID-19, so she’s losing a third of her income. It doesn’t look like she’s going to be able to pay the old amount, never mind the new one. I’m hoping they’ll re-evaluate her payments based on her new reduced income. 

Just to clarify, we have the same level of education in the same field (social work) from public institutions, so this wasn’t any kind of extravagant spending on her part. Just an attempt to climb out of poverty via education and do a little good along the way. 

What’s unique about her situation is that she’s a permanent resident in Canada and has lived here for 4 years. We’re wondering if it’s even worth paying the partial interest on her US student loans any more. There’s no hope of ever paying down the principle with our incomes. We don’t want to destroy her credit in the US or have them go after her impoverished mother who co-signed the loans 12 years ago. 

Any suggestions or tips to navigate US student loans as a Canadian PR?","My partner (American) and I (Canadian) both got emails about our student loans this weekNSLS emailed to tell me they automatically stopped all Canadian student loan payments with no interest accrued until September (phew!)

My girlfriend and I were supposed to pay rent today. She has loans through Sallie Mae and called a week and a half ago to put them in forbearance because we faced a huge loss of income due to coronavirus.

Not only that, but they sent a letter dated March 27th 2020, and it states that the forbearance was approved for December 2019-January 2020. She wasn’t even paying her loans in December so is this an error?

We’re both not getting any aid from the government for COVID, and now we don’t have enough money to pay rent with the money we did have saved. Both of us are extremely stressed and financially screwed right now.

I have brought up to my mother that PLUS loans can't be transferred unless it's done through a private lending company, and she is convinced otherwise. I don't intend on accepting a transfer loan when I've never had to go private as a result of my own work, and I didn't necessarily ""earn"" that potential interest rate, since most of my loans are all between 5-7%. 

I'm not sure what to do, since this is going to come to a head at some point. Honestly I feel pretty salty since over the past 4 years, I have slowly started to realize through my personal finance class that my parents did not prepare for my college funding, as my dad wasn't involved in the process and my mother had to figure everything out, and I'd much rather not have to account for this extra 8k, because if my parents had worked together to do a better job of preparing for this, we likely wouldn't be in this scenario in the first place.

EDIT: I seem to have come off much more whiny than I meant  when I originally posted this. The main gripe is the fact that I don't have a say or a discussion, I'm just being told what to do with no prior discussion with my parents, even though this is something that impacts my future finances. 

To be clear, I don't have an issue helping to pay the 8k, but my main concern is that my parents are being dismissive and not actually considering my word when this directly affects me, so I don't know how to approach them with alternatives than just refinancing.","Parents think that they can transfer Parent Plus Loans to me, the student.So it pretty much boils down to this.

t3_fs7pxj,StudentLoans,I work for a Federal Student Loan Servicer. To give you guys an idea.,"It's all pretty chaotic. Here's what we know for a fact. All ***ED*** loan accounts, are eligible for a COVID forbearance to be placed on the account until September. ***ALL*** ED loan accounts will have a 100% interest subsidy that is backdated from 3/13/20 until 9/30/20.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things that have been conveyed to us by FSA. Any and all payments made to student loan accounts ***AFTER*** 3/13/20 will be recalculated by our accounting teams once they backdate the interest to make it look like the payment was made on an account that accrued ***NO*** interest after 3/13/20. Meaning the only interest between your payment and principle balance will be interest from before that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't speak for exact dates, but expect it not to show up for a majority of people until April. Again, it ***WILL*** backdate as of right now. That's been mandated by FSA and unless THEY change it, it will update. However, there are tens of millions of accounts and quite a few of these changes have to be done manually.

Another thing to please keep in mind. FSA only just decided ***HOW*** it wanted this done, for us as servicers, last Friday. So in the midst of trying to get as many call center workers to work from home(which adds it's own troubles. Bad internet, tech problems, tech illiterate people, etc ) their trying to still keep our guys working as smoothly as possible to set this all up. As someone who also has student loans (fedloans/PHEAA) I know how frustrating this type of chaos can be, but please try to understand it's just as chaotic for the other side. Information is updating daily and it's all pretty break-neck speed for people. ***ESPECIALLY*** the call center new-hires who just started before this. I have some who report to me that I've spent hours trying to reinforce to make sure they can smoothly handle this, and it's caused a few to quit from the stress and frustration and tensions this entire thing is bringing.

t3_fsmpmv,StudentLoans,Student Loans Disappeared?,"I know federal student loans don’t disappear really, but damnit if I can’t find them!

Backstory: 18 year ago, I got student loans (Perkins) and was going to college... during that, I knocked up my girlfriend (very stupid, I know!) and I wound up dropping out of college and getting a crap job to support them and marry my girlfriend. My wife didn’t believe in loans or credit (some kind of religious thing) and we rented and paid cash for everything. Then 2 years ago, we got divorced and I signed up to CreditKarma and AnnualCreditReport.com to view my credit, expecting to see all these non-paid student loans... but my credit report was blank! I don’t have credit cards or loans and I don’t default on my utilities or insurance... so I decided to go onto StudentAid.gov and a few other federal sites to try and find the loans... nothing! I entered the FSA username and email address from back then and it said it couldn’t be found. 

I usually owe a few hundred by tax time, so they’ve never tried to garnish any tax returns since I don’t get any... and they’ve never tried to contact me, email me, call me or try and do paycheck garnishments. So i’m really wondering what happened to them and where they went?

I know anything from that long ago wouldn’t be on my credit reports because it was over 7 years ago, but you’d think they would try to find me. 

18 years ago, the balance was $12,000... i’m not sure what it would even amount to now. I want to start paying them off because well, i’m rid of the crazy religious nut and I want to better my future and I don’t like having debt looming out there somewhere. I borrowed it, I owe it and I intend to pay it back. 

Any ideas where or why they disappeared from existence and why no one tried to find me or collect on them?

Im currently still in my grace period so I haven't paid anything yet, but I was wondering if it would effect my credit score if I continued not to pay.","Will your credit score decrease if you don't repay back loans during suspension?So I read all federal student loans will be suspended, but when I logged on to my account to see my balance it now says 0% interest rate, but my payment due date remains the same.

t3_fsrodw,StudentLoans,Sallie Mae sent me an email today saying my 1098-E form is incorrect.,"Hello all!
I received an email today from Sallie Mae saying the 1098-E form that was sent to me in late January had an incorrect amount. They've sent an updated 1098-E and I've confirmed via the website that this is true and that I've paid a significant amount more in interest. The fun part is I've already filed my taxes and received monies in return. 
I should be keeping track of how much I pay in interest on all my loans to prevent this horrendous miscalculation from happening again. Has this happened to anyone before?
What do now?","Sallie Mae sent me an email today saying my 1098-E form is incorrect.Hello all!

t3_fsgtwz,StudentLoans,Coronavirus Student Loan Tricks,"I know a lot of the details are still fuzzy but does anyone have any cool tricks they are using given the changes to student loans from the coronavirus.

Personally I no longer see the point of paying any amount on student loans right now since they aren't accruing interest until September. Don't see why I wouldn't take the money I was going towards student loans, put it in a high-interest savings account (like Marcus - 1.7% interest) and pay all that at once in September. 

I know this is pretty minor but am wondering if anyone else plans to do anything out of the ordinary","Coronavirus Student Loan TricksI know a lot of the details are still fuzzy but does anyone have any cool tricks they are using given the changes to student loans from the coronavirus.
