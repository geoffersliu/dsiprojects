,personalfinance,"So, the overview: I'm an out of work cook with ~$70k in student loan debt  ($15k of it in default from Perkins Loans) and mental blocks that have kept me from really committing to a plan for my finances for a while. Credit is around 600 last I checked.  No emergency fund or savings (which is to say that I have $3k in my bank account since lockdown put a halt on many of my bills, but haven't had a long term plan to save over time).
  
The Car Problem  
My 20 year old car has done great, but is springing leaks like a cartoon rowboat and my family has been after me to commit to a ~$10k car loan to get a car and improve my credit at the same time. I need a car that can get me across multiple states sometimes, and mine has been good so far, minus literally everything that can leak now leaking. 

I think the idea of committing myself to a $280 car payment (rate I got) and adding $10k in debt, especially now that I'm out of work and not likely to return without a HUGE career shift, is insane (even at my best, I make $13/hr plus tips).  
The understanding is that I'm so unreliable, they'll have to pay the car payment anyway, or that it's better that the car is in my name in case something happens to my dad, and they're offering $3k to help with a down payment. With this understanding, there has been nothing but argument over the specifics of the car for going on a year. Price, and they have strong opinions about my choice of car as well. The $3k is obviously conditional on my choosing a car and situation that they want for me. 

I feel like if I'm doing anything with $10k, it's going to be to figure out how to pay off those ($15k) defaulted loans before September 30th, while interest and collections are paused. Dad is saying I need to just dispute the debt for however long it takes to make it go away, despite me telling him that I've already confirmed it's my debt over the phone, and that I thought the stress of trying to dispute a debt I'm objectively responsible for wasn't worth it.   
I'm not against the idea in principle (since I only actually took out $10k in loans and 1.5x that seems excessive, why not screw The Man?), but I think I just want to move on with my life.  

As for getting a higher salary, after which I'd happily take on a car payment, most of my options would take me out of the country (once that's an option). Picking fruit in New Zealand, teaching English in South Korea or Vietnam. Both would make more than what I've been doing. 
 Alternatively, a cheaper education in Norway or Germany with a part time job could be a better long term investment than a $10k car. (I've been thinking about getting my MBA and going into imports/exports of seafood or something like that, but I haven't figured out a career path there yet).  

Any advice or perspective on this situation would be really helpful. I'm just not seeing the forest for the trees right now and don't know what the right call with my money is. (And when you have so little of it, every decision is stressful!)

,personalfinance,"Hi, so I with public affairs background had a second round of an interview as a regional lead in 3 Eastern European markets for an ecommerce company. My advantage (not a requirement in the posting) is that I speak all three languages.  However no business school or ecommerce experience (required). The rest of the requirements I fulfill.

I had a one hour interview with my future boss, he seemed kind and smiling during the interview, i think i answered the questions well, even the more technical ones, he saw that I have done my research and tried hard.

The business case went okay, I watched hours of videos but obviously I made mistakes, he had to correct me or question my calculations a few times, I got stuck/confused once,I admitted I haven't done a business case before but I really enjoyed it. I came to a conclusion in the end, but what matters more is my analytical thinking.

The second part was with his colleague, it was cut shorter (first one got prolonged), he seemed a bit more distant, I'm not sure I convinced him, I was also quite brain dead after an hour of interview anyway.

My friend said to maybe offer taking only 70-80% of salary for the first 2-3 months while i get the hang of the business side. I've never heard of this, but she said her employer liked the idea.

,personalfinance,"Hey guys,

My net pay (after taxes) per month is: $4,137.94

I live in NYC and the place I'm looking to rent is in a luxury building. The rent is $1350 per month (discounted due to pandemic), and the utility bills will be anywhere between $70-$100 per month.

I do not have any debt. My only consistent after tax recurring expenses are groceries which amount to about $450 per month, and Roth IRA contributions at $568 per month.

Trasporation is covered via an FSA in which I allocate $127 per month from my pay check (Will modify since I don't use public transportation currently). And I automatically deposit $984.86 into a 401K (10% annual salary with employer matching 75% up to 6% and maxing HSA annually).

The lease would be for 10 months at which time I would could renew or leave. I have made rough calculation in which I would be paying about 35% of net pay on rent, closer to 44% once utilities are included.

,personalfinance,"Hello friends, in a bit of a pickle. I was laid off from a paid part-time internship in mid March, moved back home with my parents when in-person classes were cancelled to help take care of my father who is battling cancer. I applied for unemployment in mid April but with 18 credit hours of online class finishing up and my father starting a new chemo treatment life has just been kind of a blur the last month or so and I’m kind of just now getting my head straight. 

My savings were basically depleted from not working from mid March-early May, so I got a job as fast as I could figuring I hadn’t been eligible for unemployment since i never got a letter in the mail or an email saying I had been (this is the f*** up). I started working about a week ago as a temporary employee at a large grocery chain. I wear two masks to work and use hand sanitizer any chance I get, but the general public does not usually take those same precautions. My father was denied his chemo treatment today due to his white blood cell count being too low and was told to be extra careful to make sure not to get sick as any infection could send him to the hospital. This prompted me to log into my states (MI) unemployment website and lo and behold I found a letter there saying I was approved for 39 weeks of unemployment by my state before I even started my job. I also missed the first window for certification according to the determination letter. This means instead of potentially risking my parents lives by going to work everyday I could’ve been paid more to stay home and help my father. Is there anything I can do? I’ve been calling the unemployment number nonstop since the second they opened this morning with no luck yet. Thank you all in advance.

Context: In February, 2020 I accepted an offer to work at a new company in NYC. Currently living in Houston, TX.
My original start date was April, and I managed to find an apartment in the city in the first week of March and signed my lease quickly. At the time, my plan was to break my current lease in Houston and move the first week of April.



Unfortunately, as I’m sure you can tell by the timing, I had to postpone my move across the country due to the current lockdown.
As of right now, I’m currently paying rent for my apartment in Houston (where I will most likely be for the next month or two), and ALSO, paying rent for my apartment in NYC (which I haven’t even set foot in, yet...)

The NYC leasing office gave me the option to fill out an application to restructure the lease payment and provide some flexibility there, but unfortunately it is solely dependent on my “Loss of income due to the quarantine ”, which, I don’t necessarily qualify for—because I’m being paid normally as I work from home here in TX.

Just a quick note regarding “why don’t you just break the lease of one or the other?”, the Houston apartment is charging me 4-months rent upfront to give a 60-day notice, and the NYC apartment lease states I have to pay 3 months rent up front to give a 60 day notice. Both of which I will still have to pay the residual months (in the 60&amp; 90 day windows of my leaving.... which is a huge chunk of cheddar)

&lt;p&gt;I have brought it up before our divorce and pretty much got told I agreed to it and nothing can be done. That I will have to believe that she will keep paying it off like she has. She has efficient income and funds but I’m wondering if there is anything that could be done? Suppose she stops paying and I get hit with the late payments. I’m aware that I am ultimately responsible for the debt. I’m just at ease as to what should have been done close to divorce or what can even be other options besides to resume payment if they decide not to pay anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if the bad English it is not my first language.&lt;/p&gt;

Misc/random necessities-$400

My take home pay each month is about $4000 and my wife’s is about $2600.

My wife has a pension with her job, so she is not offered any sort of retirement plan with a match. I have contributed past the match amount for the year in my 401k at this point. We have each maxed out Roth IRA’s for 2019 and 2020 at this point.  Additionally, I have recently put about 7k in the stock market in a regular brokerage account. 

My plan at this point was to put keep about 30k in a Hysa, which we are currently using Discover bank for. Additionally, I was planning on keeping about 5k in our checking account to keep cash around 35k.

First time here but my friend said this place is a great community.  Many thanks in advance for any help you might be able to offer.

I'm looking to buy a house this summer.  I'm at the point of getting a pre-approval and have decided that an 80/10/10 loan is probably best for me.  First time home buyer, 800+ credit score, and just enough to put 10% down for a house in my price range.  After doing some rough math I'm certain I can afford the two mortgages - the 2nd mortgage is practically what I would be paying in PMI anyways.

My question is, how does one actually get pre-approved for an 80/10/10 loan?  It's my understanding that often the two loans are from different banks, is this correct?  Would it be best/easiest to use a mortgage broker?  If I go the broker route, and chose a lender paid broker, does that mean I effectively get their services for free?  Or would that just mean I'm paying either higher closings costs or will have a higher rate with a with a loan from a broker that's lender paid?

,personalfinance,"Hi all,

First time poster here and not too knowledgeable about taxes, so I apologize if my question has been previously discussed or if it doesn’t make sense. 

I lived in Maryland until 5/1 this year, and due to the pandemic, I’ve had to move back home to Pennsylvania. During these 4 months while living in Maryland, I maxed out my traditional IRA ($6k) and traditional 401k ($19.5k). 

While currently living in Pennsylvania, I’m still working in Maryland. I understand that these states have a reciprocity, so I will have to file a return in PA, not MD, for the amount of time that I live in PA during all of this.

I just learned that traditional IRA and traditional 401k contributions are not deductible from income in PA in the year of contribution.

My question to you is will I still be able to deduct these contributions ($25.5k) from my income if I continue to live in PA until the end of the year, since I made them during the 4 months while I was living in Maryland? 

Also, on a different topic that I’m just curious about, but I’m probably missing something - wouldn’t it make sense for all PA residents to contribute to a Roth 401k and Roth IRA since traditional contributions are not deductible in PA?

I apologize if my questions do not make sense - I just stumbled upon this info and would appreciate clarification!

&lt;p&gt;First time poster here and not too knowledgeable about taxes, so I apologize if my question has been previously discussed or if it doesn’t make sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Maryland until 5/1 this year, and due to the pandemic, I’ve had to move back home to Pennsylvania. During these 4 months while living in Maryland, I maxed out my traditional IRA ($6k) and traditional 401k ($19.5k). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While currently living in Pennsylvania, I’m still working in Maryland. I understand that these states have a reciprocity, so I will have to file a return in PA, not MD, for the amount of time that I live in PA during all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just learned that traditional IRA and traditional 401k contributions are not deductible from income in PA in the year of contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

Goals: 
-$150,000 Downpayment savings for a home in 2-3 years.  We are savings $2k per month aside from our retirement accounts.  
-Determine how to invest $10,000 in a brokerage account for 20+ year horizon.  High risk tolerance.  
-Determine how to invest $3k annual contributions to Roth IRA for 20+ year horizon. High risk tolerance.  

QUESTIONS:
1.) I am having a difficult time determining when to stop contributing to our 401k/457s and start putting into our Roth’s.  I’ve been advised to “put as much as you can” into the pre tax accounts but I appreciate the flexibility of the Roth’s and brokerage should we have unexpected financial expenses. How would you allocate it?

2.) What funds would you fill the brokerage and Roth IRA with?  And in which accounts? I’m risk tolerant so I’m leaning towards sector funds and overweighting with well performing/stable stocks.   I’d like to be healthily exposed to a healthcare index fund, IT and others.  I understand the mentality of the bogle method the three fund portfolio but with time on my side I want to be a bit more exposed.  

I think I hit all the points the bulletin asked for, if I’m missing anything please let me know.  I appreciate your time.

,personalfinance,"tldr: My friend has been over contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and needs to know what to do.

\--

My friend and I somehow got onto the topic of the Retirement Savings Credit and I mentioned that he should plug his Roth IRA contribution into Turbo Tax to see if he qualifies for it.  Much to our surprise, inputting the Roth IRA contribution actually did the opposite, it led to an increase in the amount owed.  Before this year he had always done his taxes by hand.

Upon some investigating we found that that the income limit  for Roth IRA contributions is $10,000 (?!) for someone who files married but separately (and actually live together).  His income is well above $10k.

So now my friend is starting to freak out a bit because he then tells me he has been contributing to a Roth IRA for 12 years and has been filing married/separately the entire time (his wife has student loan issues).

He doesn't keep his paperwork for anything really but estimates that he has been investing approximately $3,000 each year and his income has always been above $10k.

So what is he looking at?  6% penalty on each and every single $3,000 contribution for each and every single year?  That's like $14,000 in penalties, right?  For $36,000 in contributions that seems pretty steep.

Then he would still have to take all this money out of the Roth IRA, right?  So he would have to pay a 10% penalty and income taxes on the earnings (since he does not seem to have a qualified exception)?

He has no idea what his gains are but if we assume $10k in gains that could be $1,000 in a 10% penalty and, say, $1,500 in 2020 income taxes (not sure his tax rate, but let's just say 15%).

So now he has to pay the $14,000ish in contribution penalty and $2,500 in penalties and taxes on the earnings, so $16,500 in total?

Please someone tell me that we are wrong in our understanding of the consequences on his contributions!  This seems ridiculously harsh.  He has a call out to an accountant but who knows when he'll actually be able to go in for an appointment with this lockdown we are in.

&lt;p&gt;He has no idea what his gains are but if we assume $10k in gains that could be $1,000 in a 10% penalty and, say, $1,500 in 2020 income taxes (not sure his tax rate, but let&amp;#39;s just say 15%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now he has to pay the $14,000ish in contribution penalty and $2,500 in penalties and taxes on the earnings, so $16,500 in total?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please someone tell me that we are wrong in our understanding of the consequences on his contributions!  This seems ridiculously harsh.  He has a call out to an accountant but who knows when he&amp;#39;ll actually be able to go in for an appointment with this lockdown we are in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth his financial manager, who made very clear he cannot give out tax advice, said he should just leave it and play dumb if the IRS ever comes calling.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hi,

First off, huge thanks to everyone who created this subreddit and contribute to people's posts. I've been lurking and reading and I've found alot of helpful information.

I left my W-2 job at the end of the second week of January. Since then I've been an IC; I got paid one day as a production assistant for a huge event. I've also worked on one small project, but that barely made me around $125. I've been approved for UI benefits, and plan to use those funds to pay off credit card debt (around $2K), and I have money ready to put in an high-yield savings account as an emergency fund.

I'm 27, finished graduate school last year, and my graduate student loans are currently deferred. I'm living at home, and my monthly expenses are around $700 for now. I'm looking for full-time work at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can I still open a Roth IRA and use the funds from my W-2 job to contribute to 2019?
2. If so, I'm debating between Fidelity and Schwab, any insights on who to go with based on my profile? I'm very new to all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that I wouldn't be able to contribute to 2020 until I earn income apart from unemployment.

Any insights are greatly appreciated; thank you!

Edit: I also read about Schwab acquiring TD...do you think this would give Schwab a leg up?

,personalfinance,"Hi, sorry for the length here. Just trying to get some actual understanding behind my layoff as it's been very hard to find clarification. I was laid off (""indefinitely"" they said) at the end of March due to Covid, with no return date listed on my notice of separation. They also provided a check for two weeks of pay and checked the box on the NOS that said they were providing Pay In Lieu Of Notice. Almost everyone got laid off at the same time, minus a few ""essential"" people. So this means I was actually terminated, am I correct? 


I'm curious because they're starting to call some of us (oddly not all of us or any of our upper management but myself included) to ask if we want to come back. I was previously the head cashier, but when they called me they offered a general cashier position, not my previous one, and another prior coworker told me they offered her a different position as well. I'm also concerned because with school out and my normal babysitter high risk thus self isolating, I'm currently the primary caregiver for my special needs child, so it's impossible for me to currently return to work until either school's return or I have access to his babysitter (he's comfortable around her and she's got experience with his particular delays). Daycare isn't really a feasible option for us for a few reasons, and many here are still closed down. 


Anyways, I relayed that info to them and told them while I would like to eventually come back if I could, I'm not going to currently be able to due to the above, so I've been a little stressed that if they called to offer me work they might fill out a refusal form with unemployment.

,personalfinance,"Hi there! I am hoping to get some advice regarding my current debt situation. Yes, I am $47k in debt and obviously very concerned about it. I moved to Los Angeles a year and a half ago, and was unable to find a job as quickly as I expected -- in the year it took to find one, I blew through my savings and took out a few loans in order to keep my head above water (I WAS working at the time -- I commuted weekly to San Diego to work 30 hours a week at my last job there, but it wasn't enough). The 17k loan was basically a refinance of an earlier large loan from a different creditor. Because I was unable to find a job for so long, I defaulted on this loan (choosing to stay current on my other loans/credits in order to continue having a good relationship with my credit union) and it was sent to collections last December.

&amp;nbsp;

I was sent a letter in April from American Recovery Service Inc. claiming they now had my debt and offering to settle for 50% of the amount due ($17087 &gt; $8500). I missed the 21 day deadline to respond due to the hectic stress of the pandemic, and am wondering it its worth it to reach out to them. From what I've gathered while doing research, settlements usually mean you pay everything right then and there... which I obviously can't.

&amp;nbsp;

I reached out to a nonprofit credit counseling company and had them look at my debt. They sent me a Debt Management Plan that claims I will be paid off on my debt in 3 years, but this does NOT include the loan that is in collections. I emailed the company back asking why the loan in collections was not included and if they are doing anything to help out their clients affected by the pandemic. My credit agency is pushing back due dates and willing to work with me when I get behind, and I'm not sure that would also be possible with the DMP. The DMP monthly payment would be $968.

&amp;nbsp;

My credit was actually really good before my loan payments fell behind, and I know it's likely shit now. I've been too scared to check it...

- $60 Care Credit Line ($1700 balance, 14.9% interest rate)
- $80 Cell Phone
- $75 Cat related expenses

Total with Lending Club Loan, not included above: $3350

&amp;nbsp;

I was lucky enough to land a job in October, then another in December, so from end of December through March I was working 70-80 hours per week (because of the debt I stupidly incurred). I work in hospitality though, and both of my hotels closed the same day due to COVID-19. I am currently on Unemployment.

&amp;nbsp;

Income After Taxes/month (before COVID-19): $4000, at the least
Income After Taxes/month (EDD): $3000

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, EDD bases your eligibility on the first four of the last five quarters.... and I made half of what I did at the most during that time. I have been meaning to call them to see if they will change it to what I made in the 5th quarter and this backpay me for the difference, but I'm not holding my breath that they will agree. I will likely not return to work until July. I wish I could say that I put a lot towards savings during these three months, but I had a few other debts I needed to pay off and expenses I could not avoid.

&amp;nbsp;

If it helps, I am single and live alone. My family are all living barely above the poverty line, and have all left the state. Due to my career, I have to stay in LA.

&amp;nbsp;

Tldr: I am wondering if it is worth it to contact the collections agency that currently owns my $17k loan and try to settle it for half off (and if they will do payment plans?) or what other options I have besides ignoring it and hoping for the best. I am also wondering if a debt management plan is a smart choice to pay down my other debt.

,personalfinance,"I received a collection agency call about a debt I have. It’s a $90 medical office bill from like 3-4 years ago.

I have excellent credit (700-800 range) so if they were to report it, my score won’t ultimately suffer much. But also if it did, I’m not making any big purchases in the near future. Maybe not even in the next 7 years.

I don’t think they would take me to court to try to garnish wages, because it’s a small sum and filing for small court is like a $40 fee plus lawyer fees. But if they did, I guess they can have the $90 then. Not sure if the margin is worth it.

On the other hand, I would keep getting these phone calls. Can’t block the number since it’s always different, but I could send them a cease and desist letter at which point I think they’d have to.

,personalfinance,"Hey all,
I just bought a house in upstate South Carolina in December.
It is my first home and I am now faced with an opportunity of free housing in NC, still close to my job in SC.
My girlfriend’s parents are leaving for California and are leaving the home to her for us to live in.
We won’t have to pay anything.
I want to rent out my house as I’ll be able to pay for it even while it’s vacant, I’m not concerned about our relationship, my job or the worst case of being “kicked out” as I could afford more in housing. I made $80k last year with projected $130k (basicly guaranteed) in the coming 3 years. My home is $135k so I feel comfortable having to make the occasional payment on both my rental and another housing situation (rent/another home, depending on time) for several months at a time. I’ve also saved $10k as an emergency savings which I may increase?

All my questions are regarding what do I need to know renting out my only primary residence?

Will my taxes change for the whole year?

How do I go about making it into a rental, legally?

It’s all come pretty quickly. We’d move in the house in about a month and I just want to know all that I might need to know?

Me and her will be splitting the income in the meantime until we potentially marry.
I’m on a 20 year mortgage at 3.25apr so I’m not exactly looking to make a profit over the payment. Just to make the monthly mortgage or more then share half.


Edit: House is built in 2000, 2000sqft
so not too old and decently sized.
I’m about replace the Air handler. Everything else is brand new basically.

I drive a 2008 Nissan Sentra that has 150,817 miles on it. My issue is that I have 3 lights that popped up the check engine soon, airbag light and tire pressure light.

So my situation is this. I was furloughed from my part-time, barely-above-minimum-wage job recently due to the COVID pandemic. This is kind of okay for me, it gives me more time to do homework and the government is giving me WAY MORE money than I was originally making so I'm actually going to be saving money 5 times as fast as when I was working. Problem is, I'm at the point where I think it would be financially irresponsible for me to get a temporary full time job over the summer (which was my original plan before all this happened).

My second issue is that my rental history is not great. I'm still on a lease in San Francisco with my old roommates who refused to change the lease when I had to leave in July of last year. We never, ever had an issue with paying rent or bills on time while I lived there. But since moving out, they have paid the rent late multiple times AND no one currently has put the gas and electric bill in their name since I took mine off, so PG&amp;E has been sending the bill to collections since August, marring everyone's credit. There is nothing I can really do at this point, none of them will listen to me and the management company in charge of the old house will not let me out of the month to month lease unless everyone in the house either moves out or signs a new year-long lease, which my old roommates will not do. (Never move in with strangers you met on Craigslist, kids.)

My final issue is that I have no credit history other than the collections. I wasn't dumb enough to get a credit card as a teenager and it just never came up again until now. This was dumb and all my bad. I do, however, have over $10k saved up in the bank and will have over $12k at the end of the month.

However, the two friends that I am planning on moving in with do have good credit. One of them is over 600 and the other one is over 700. One with no rental history and just moving out of his parent's place and one has good rental history.

My main question is how do we go about this when I've fucked up so badly? Are we going to have to have a cosigner, and does that always mean we'll have to pay higher rent? A higher security deposit is fine, I have the money, but am I even eligible to sign a lease?

,personalfinance,"Hello,

I normally don't really check my credit because nothing is going on, I'm not looking for loans and haven't had the need to apply for credit in several years. I recently got a warning that my credit is negatively affected by an account listed as ELAN financial services (actually 90 days late). I immediately disputed it with the credit reporting agencies as I have never heard of ELAN, and assumed it is a scam of some sort.

I did also call a number for ELAN I could find on the web, but their phone system is horrible. I called countless times, and I get nowhere. I never received any communication by mail or phone from them either. They acknowledge that I have an account based on my social security which I begrudgingly gave one of these people, even though I feel like I was helping scammers, and my trust was immediately betrayed as after giving the person my ssn they promptly refused to give me any information in return (they cannot tell me anything about the account for security reasons, but now they got my SSN). They said that if I made a payment to them right then, they will talk to a supervisor about getting me the account number. I'm not falling for that. I asked them how they could possibly do this to me, and they said its because I have a ""converted account"". I don't know what that means. The amount of money they want is tiny (200 USD roughly), but I'm not about to be extorted/robbed for that. After that episode I reported this scam operation to the consumer protection agency here in CA.

,personalfinance,"Hey all, I am a 2020 college grad who (assuming Corona doesn't change anything) will be moving to NYC in August to start a full time job. I'm looking to budget and will give all info below, please help out if you can.

Salary: $57,000 annual salary, OT eligible. Additional $3,000 paid in the first paycheck (not up front). I'm assuming after a 31% total tax rate I'll have in the ballpark of $3,270 per month, not inc. the bonus.

Savings: I'll be going into the move with about $8,000 in savings assuming I'll be able to get a part time job for the rest of the summer before the move. This plus the bonus (at 31% tax) gives me just over $10,000 liquid. I also have a $2,500 line of credit with zero current balance, and I'd rather use savings than credit to finance the move.

Expenses:
Rent: Looking at the housing market in NYC, I believe I can get a studio in the range of $1,250/ month without living in a shady area. I think $1350 (inc. utilities/ internet/ laundry) has to be my hard cap, and as much as I'm likely looking for something that doesn't exist, I'd like to be as close to work as possible and not have to deal with roommates. This may be better suited for a NYC sub, but is this all reasonable?

Student Loans: The absolute monkey wrench in all of this. I went to a larger school as a first generation student and financed it almost entirely on loans. Starting in December 2020 I'll be paying $1,265 per month for the foreseeable future. My parents have said they'll do a 2/3rds split (meaning I'll only pay $820) but I'd rather plan to pay the whole thing in case they back out.

Other Expenses: this is another part that I'm pretty clueless on. Is budgeting $400 a month for food fair? I'm a pretty good cook and can make do with lots of pasta/ chicken/ cheap veggies, but at the same time I'm a big guy and can certainly eat a fair amount if given the opportunity; fast food adds up quick. There's also the subway pass at $127/ mo, and other assorted expenses (amazon, other travel/ fun money, taking care of a small pet, etc.)

Adding it all up I understand that I'm very close to my monthly limit, and this is with zero savings, zero investment into retirement, and limited ""fun money."" I know the loans are a lot, and trust me I know what I signed up for in that regard. But from a strictly budgeting standpoint, does this all add up?

I have two balance transfer offers available:

If I transfer $10,000 with the first offer I will pay a $500 flat transfer fee, making the total payoff amount $10,500 over 12 months which would require a minimum payment of $875/month to pay off the amount by the end of the introductory period.

,personalfinance,"Hello, I recently graduated from college and decided to apply for refinancing of my student loans due to the current rates. Some background on my situation:

* I graduated last month and made sure to wait until all my grades came in to verify I graduated
* I luckily have a job secured that pays very well and allows me extra money to pay towards loans
* I only applied to have my private loans (approx. $25k) refinanced

I had to jump through a few hoops to prove I graduated and to verify my income but throughout the process my advisor at the loan company didn't raise any issues about my eligibility for a loan. I recently got an email saying that I was denied due to information they received from a credit reporting agency. The thing is, my credit score is really good (770). I have been building credit for the past 4 years with a credit card that I have never missed a payment on. I have also been making additional payments to my student loans while I was in school.

&amp;#x200B;

Would anyone know why my application could have been rejected? ~~They're saying they won't tell me specifically why.~~

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Their letter to me says that I ""did not meet program requirements"" followed by a description that consulting credit agencies partially or entirely resulted in their decision to deny me. Any idea what this means?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: I dove deeper on the student loan provider's website. These are their eligibility requirements for refinancing:

* Must be US citizen or Permanent Resident (I am)
* Must be age of majority or older (I am)
* Must have minimum loan amount of $15000 (I do)
* Must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher (I did)
* Must have minimum income of $35000 (I do)
* Must have minimum credit score of 680 (I do)
* Must have a minimum credit history of 36 months (I do)
* Must have a degree from an approved institution (I do according to their website)

,personalfinance,"Reposting since I didn't get an answer on /r/credit, hoping the fine folks of /r/personalfinance have some insight.

Last year in December, I was contacted by a collections agency about a deliquent account. At first, I thought they had the wrong number because I'm anal retentive about paying my bills in full and on time, but looked into it further and realized an old apartment complex made a mistake when I moved out and overcharged me for something that didn't appear on my account for several months. I had also received email confirmation that my account was settled and I would not be charged any further. When I called the apartment complex, they confirmed it was a mistake and said they would work with the collection agency to make sure I didn't get dinged. The agency seemed to recognize it as a mistake and stated that they would ""mark the account as paid in full and removed from your credit report."" They also stated it would be a few weeks until I'll see it reflected correctly on the reports.

I understand marking an account paid and removing the remark to be two different things - that marking an account as paid means that the debt was valid, and removing it means it won't show up at all. Can anyone offer insight and if I should push back on them to specifically remove it completely, or am I misunderstanding how this process works?

,personalfinance,"Hello, all I am trying to figure out my situation for living for this next year and was wondering all of your advice. 

Basically, my girlfriend and I are talking about getting married in December or May. When we do, this will be the start of us living together (we won't until we do get married and we do want to have an actual wedding as much as we can with all that is going on). She is a student and has 1 year left and I am graduated and working full-time.

Essentially I am deciding to live with someone else and split the rent or live alone. It would be about $400 splitting but about $700-800+ on my own. To preface, I have a job where I make enough to support myself well. I make roughly $3400 a month after taxes. Right now I am probably paying $450 for everything in total.

If I choose to live alone, I am ready for either decision we make on when to get married. She can always just move into where I will be living. However, we may not end up getting married until May then I would basically be living alone until then and having to pay more money. She would come over, but I do not know how well that would end up working out for my own mental health and just finances in general managing it all.

The other option is I get a place with my friend and me until we get married. However, after we get married I will have to find someone to sublease me when I move out. When she moves out, we have to pay $300 off her rent a month until the lease ends next July. If we get married in December, I will have to find someone to sublease and we will have to find a place to live for 6 months until she graduates as we may move after that point. If I can't find a sublease,  that would be an extra $400 a month I would have to pay on top of my new rent and my GF's $300. And we would have to find a place with only like a 3-month lease. If we get married in May or summerish, I would move out and we would have to find a place only for the summer or we would have to move into the place I was already living until we knew where we would be for the next year, or I could ask my roommate to move home for a few months but I do not know if he would do that. It would just be a really hard situation.

Basically, if I move in with someone, we have a lot more things that we need to end up figuring out. But I could save a lot more money to help pay for a wedding over those months, regardless of when we decide to get married if I move in with someone.

Bought my first house in 2005: 1000 sq ft. Ranch 100K (Ohio)
80/20 Loan(s) no money down; primary loan adjustable interest rate, second loan interest only balloon

Now here is my problem, balloon is up (April 2020) owe 16K
primary adjustable has 60K balance (7%)
House is maybe worth 75K on the market based on recent sales in the neighborhood.

I know....but I cannot charge more than someone will pay and the neighborhood is not that great, ok....but not great.
I was hoping the neighborhood and home prices would turn around eventually and I could eventually sell.

Renters still paying rent, however both are laid off now; I have approached them many times to buy, however they do not want to or cannot (especially now.)
What do I do with this? I cannot continue to dump money into this house and I do not have 16K to pay off the balloon.

Lets say best case scenario I get my portfolio to $30,000 in diversified stock over the next 5-10 years do I just keep reinvesting or do you take a large percentage of the paid dividends as profit and only reinvest a small portion? Honestly I don’t know enough about what I’m talking about yet but I haven’t found any suggestions on when to transfer money into your bank account from your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: 
1. Yes I understand that dividends is not the only way to make money in stocks
2. I understand that 1-6% in dividends per stock is divided quarterly so the pay out could be .20 cents a share per quarter&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"I have an actively managed mutual fund that over the past 10 years has provided me a rate of return of 13.5%

This account now has 30k in it. I anticipate the next few years it will be hit as it tends to do poorly in times of recession. My other hesitation is that the exchange rate is 0.007 

I have an additional 15k now I want to put lump sum in a mutual fund. 
I am thinking I will do VTSAX with Vanguard as I love the 0.0004 exchange rate. Also i anticipate this fund will not take as hard of hit and feels like less of a risk. 


Is it dumb to not put more in my original actively managed fund with a different institution than Vanguard? I guess what I am asking is it dumb to not load up on 1 fund for a greater balance or is it ok to diversify even amongst broad mutual funds?

Moving forward, I have 401k employer matched maxed. 2019 Roth maxed. 

I anticipate I will add roughly 500 month to VTSAX and 250 to actively managed fund.

,personalfinance,"Hello everyone,

So I think I really messed up on filling my back taxes. 

I filled on time for 2015, my first year partially in Japan, as I had some income from part time jobs That I worked in the US. However, I didn’t end up owing anything thanks to claiming the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, and that US income not being too much. 


After that, since I had no US income, and I thought my income would effectively be zero due to the FEIE, I didn’t file for three years. 

 Recently, with COVID 19 and stimulus checks, I decided to look into the laws, and realized that even with the FEIE, I obviously still need to file every year.

I panicked and filed out and mailed all three of my late years returns by paper, including the FEIE in each. What I didn’t however do was write the statement “Filed Pursuant to Section 1.911-7(a)(2)(i)(D)” on any of them. I didn’t realize it was necessary at the time because the wording of this [webpage](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/choosing-the-foreign-earned-income-exclusion) for the F2555 made it seem like that was only necessary if I would owe taxes, and I don’t earn too much (~36-37k usd at most per year).

My question is, is there anything I can do to amend that error? Or is there any way that I could still keep the FEIE despite that small and very possibly critical error?

Sorry for the rant, I’m extra stressed with the current situation, as I’m sure you all are too, in addition to my current predicament. And being in limbo due to paper returns not being processes is not helping.

,personalfinance,"Hey all - here's some info about my sitaution:

I'm 27, single, and live in California. I got a hefty raise before this whole coronavirus thing - it was initially delayed, but is now effective as of May 1st.

My main long-term goal is to buy a house (still a long way off from that though). In the short-term, I will probably need to buy a new (used) car in the next 2-3 years as my current car is getting pretty old (2007). Mainly i just want to save and travel a little bit.

I also may be starting small side business which would require 2-3k in start up costs, but wouldn't really require much more cash beyond that.

Salary: $73,000

401k Contribution: 3% (no employer match, but they offer a safe harbor contribution of 3% of salary which i'm eligible for starting September)

IRA Contribution: I only contributed $200 last year, but would like some advice on 2020

Net Pay after tax, 401k, health insurance: $4,138/month (or) $49,656/year

My monthly expenses are roughly $2,000/month, but in an emergency situation, I could probably get it down to about $1,700 - maybe less if I absolutely had to

I owe about $1k on my car @ 6% interest, which should be paid off in the next 4/5 months. Other than that, I don't have any debt.

Currently my money is split:

1. Cash (checking/saving) - $12,100
2. Investment Account - $3,500
3. Retirement (401k/IRAs) - $8,100

Total = $23,700

What are your thoughts on that moving forward? I'm in a position to start saving a decent amount of money every month, but I want to be conscious of staying somewhat liquid to buy a car at some point and possibly start that side business. And even though it's a long way off, I also want to be able to buy a house at some point. I think you can only pull $10,000 from your IRA for that without getting penalized, which in California is basically nothing for the down payment.

,personalfinance,"I graduated in December 2018 and currently have about 44k in student loans. I have 8 loans with interest rates ranging from about 3.85% - 5.1%. I’m currently on the standard repayment plan, and my payments are about $450/mo, which we can afford, but I’m considering different repayment options to try to take advantage of the different interest rates to pay less over the life of the loans. This would basically involve switching to either the Extended Fixed (EF) or Extended Graduated (EG) Repayment Plan, which would increase the term of the loans from 10 years to 25 years and decrease my minimum monthly payments.

I would make the minimum payments on all of the loans, except for the one with the highest interest rate. I would apply any money saved from my payment reduction (and maybe apply an extra $50 - $100 each month) to pay off the highest interest loan first and then avalanche that money into the next highest interest rate loan and so on. I know that I need to check with my loan servicer first to find out if additional money over the payment amount can be applied to the principle. If this isn’t the case, then I will use either a savings account or a money market account to save up and pay off the loan once I have enough.

Ok, now here's the issue I'm facing. My father is pressing me to purchase my startup stock options. 

He believes the company might be being sold. I won't give too much detail on the company, but they have basically gotten consistent investment for years and are still pre-profit. 

In my opinion, maybe out of kool-aid drinking. I believe the company has the potential to succeed, and do truly believe in it becoming one of the larger market share holders. 

BUT we're still pre-profit &amp; from my understanding pre-proof of concept, and in my mind, no where near being bought out. (Which is what my father seems to think will happen soon)

There are investors checking us out, which I have not witnessed before. However, I assume we're just getting more investors. Not so much being bought. 

I will be maxing out my Roth IRA soon, and will have some extra money to invest.

1. Is my dad right about putting my eggs in my company? 

2.Will acquiring another investor decrease the value of my stock options?

3. Or am I right to think I can invest down the line where 'proof of business' and profit have been accomplished?

I'm miserable. I live in a city that I have no connections in with no friends and nothing to do because it's in the middle of bumfck nowhere. I'm only here because I graduated college last year and had to move back in with my parents.  Since around last fall, I've been saving up by working minimum wage jobs, and have now around 6.5K in savings. I'm looking to make that 8K come july.

I want to move desperately. I'm 23 and want to experience life in a place where there are things to do and people my age to hang out with and find an SO to build a life with. But I just feel like that's impossible to do because I am unable to get work experience in any field besides minimum wage because of where I live, and because now we have this Covid Crisis going on. I'm planning to wait out until July, but once I have that 8k I plan to book it somewhere else.

My plan is to get a cheap air n b place for 1 month, and look for a roomshare situation on craigslist as well as some jobs while staying there. I'm looking to move to a city that has a large workforce market so that I can apply for things that aren't retail. The only debt I have is a car payment that is around 300$ a month, which my parents have offered to cover for me until I land on my feet.

But I'm scared to make the jump. Both because I don't know when the country will open back up, and because I've been told moving without a job lined up is generally an awful idea.

The other problem, however, is that my parents have told me there is a possibility they will be moving overseas this fall anyway, which means I might be forced into this situation anyway.

I&amp;#39;m only here because I graduated college last year and had to move back in with my parents.  Since around last fall, I&amp;#39;ve been saving up by working minimum wage jobs, and have now around 6.5K in savings. I&amp;#39;m looking to make that 8K come july.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to move desperately. I&amp;#39;m 23 and want to experience life in a place where there are things to do and people my age to hang out with and find an SO to build a life with. But I just feel like that&amp;#39;s impossible to do because I am unable to get work experience in any field besides minimum wage because of where I live, and because now we have this Covid Crisis going on. I&amp;#39;m planning to wait out until July, but once I have that 8k I plan to book it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to get a cheap air n b place for 1 month, and look for a roomshare situation on craigslist as well as some jobs while staying there. I&amp;#39;m looking to move to a city that has a large workforce market so that I can apply for things that aren&amp;#39;t retail. The only debt I have is a car payment that is around 300$ a month, which my parents have offered to cover for me until I land on my feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m scared to make the jump. Both because I don&amp;#39;t know when the country will open back up, and because I&amp;#39;ve been told moving without a job lined up is generally an awful idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem, however, is that my parents have told me there is a possibility they will be moving overseas this fall anyway, which means I might be forced into this situation anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main cities I&amp;#39;m looking at at the moment are cities in the Valley of California, Wake County in North Carolina, and the suburbs of Chicago. I have family I can stay with in NC and Chicago Suburbs, but Sacramento is my top choice.&lt;/p&gt;

I called my bank about debt consolidation and was rejected based on my high 400 credit score..

I’ve talked to an advisor and I’m still totally unsure what to do...

I’ve considered taking out a bigger loan that would clear out all those debts previously mentioned.

I’ve also been told maybe I should do a consumer proposal which in sense makes me credit worse before it gets better meaning I don’t pay those companies it’s full cost just most of it, but I want everything gone without credit getting worse...

,personalfinance,"Hi PF - throwaway here. 

Right before the pandemic, my wife and I bought another house that fit our needs better, and moved. Our old house is paid off - so we were able to take our time in moving. Right now it’s just sitting there, because we have a few things left to fix and haven’t been able to get over there easily. 

We could rent out the old house for \~$2000 (takehome $1500 after prop taxes and saving for repairs). 

But we really want to sell the house and take home about 300k. 

We both own our own companies and are freelancers in the live event/concert business, and work a lot with schools.

Because of COVID, we’ve lost all income for Q2, Q3 and possibly Q4.  
(Gov assistance is helping some)

We’re surviving mainly on business cash savings.

We do not want to take that $300k and put it on the new house because it wouldn’t cover all the new mortgage entirely, and we would still have a payment anyway each month.  

\-zero debt (aside from new house mortgage)  
\-$1500 a month mortgage on new house @ 4%  
\-including mortgage, about $5k/month expenses  
\-no kids (no plan for kids in the future)  
\-been living off of business cash savings reserves  
\-have 401k and 6 month emergency fund that we haven’t touched yet. 

So:

1. Are we crazy for wanting to sell the old house (instead of renting)?
2. Are we crazy to want to put most of the cash into a longterm managed investment account? (Instead of pay down new house)

The idea with investing is this:  
We did a managed account with Vanguard last year. We put in $100k, in Jan 2019 made $14k in 11 months, and used that $114k to put a downpayment on our new house.

Let’s say we sell the old house and take home $300k.    
I would want to put $200k in Vanguard and the remaining $100k would    
So, even if we only make 8% return in Vanguard, I feel like it’s an easier way to have cash quickly (even though it would be taxed) if we HAVE to pull it out for living expenses down the road. And if we don’t have to touch it, then it grows.  

I REALLY like the idea of renting for residual income, but maybe with our jobs and in the current climate, it might be better to have a lump sum of cash.  
Also - with our jobs, we would HAVE to hire a management company. When we’re on shows, we’re unavailable to repair things or even talk with someone about a dishwasher not working.

I explained the possibility of forbearance on their mortgage due to COVID, but they were behind on their obligations prior to COVID and forbearance has not been offered. 

I have money saved up that I can offer to help, but I’d rather get them professional assistance as it could have a lasting impact on their financial situation, as opposed to temporary relief if I were to pay a small portion of their balance for breathing room. 

Are there any programs available that would help them with their debt? I’ve seen mixed reviews about debt relief programs, and working with lawyers could be costly. Any input you all have would be greatly appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;I explained the possibility of forbearance on their mortgage due to COVID, but they were behind on their obligations prior to COVID and forbearance has not been offered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have money saved up that I can offer to help, but I’d rather get them professional assistance as it could have a lasting impact on their financial situation, as opposed to temporary relief if I were to pay a small portion of their balance for breathing room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any programs available that would help them with their debt? I’ve seen mixed reviews about debt relief programs, and working with lawyers could be costly. Any input you all have would be greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to help them with this, and it has been tough on me discovering the extent of their problems. Thank you in advance for any ideas or input that you are willing to share.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"You guessed it, this is in SF/Bay Area, CA.

I am 24 and I currently make 130k a year or 160k after bonus. I have been living in a shared house paying $1,600 in rent but I am getting kicked out in the next couple months because the owners want to move back into their home. This is unfortunate but I feel like I might be in a good enough place financially to finally rent my own apartment. I'm also looking forward to having my own place as I have had roommates since I was 17 years old in college. Even more unfortunate is that I live in Bay Area where rent is ridiculous. I am looking at studios for $2-2.2k. So after utilities I could be paying let's say $2,300 for living expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Some details:  
Currently have a 6 month emergency fund sitting in a high interest savings account  
About 30k invested in retirement across 401k and Roth IRA (have to do backdoor this year).  
10k Car Note @ 2.99% interest  
I contribute 6% to my 401k to get the matching and max out my Roth IRA. I was planning on increasing to about 10%  
No major expenses coming up that I wouldn't be able to cover with cash or plans for further education

&amp;#x200B;

Budget outside of living expenses:  
Net Monthly Income after 401k, Insurance, and maxing IRA is $6,000 (before bonus. bonus is additional unbudgeted money for me)  
Transportation: $500 a month ($270 car payment, $100 insurance, $130 gas)  
Food: $300 a month  
Misc: $500 a month (clothes, skincare, entertainment, subscriptions, treating family/friends out)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a retirement model built out and my soft goal is to retire by 46. I did the math and if I were to save that additional $700 a month I would spend on rent for 3 years in the market, with 7% compounding interest it would be \~100k when I turn 46 (someone check my math), which I guess would shave a lot of time towards that goal, however how long am I supposed to keep living in a house with strangers where I feel uncomfortable bringing guests and partners over?

In the last 2 years I’ve had a reliable and good paying job. Now I’m ready to buy a home but I need to bring my credit up. I paid small medical bills I had let go in to collections (I don’t know some times these things just happen in your young adulthood). 

But now I have to pay the tuition from my last semester at a university when I dropped out without making any payments. 2 years ago I made payments to a collection agency so the school would release my transcript to my new school, but I never finished paying. 

So presently there is a new collection agency handling this. First call to them at the end of April they say they can submit a settlement offer to the school but it needs to be 75-80% of the amount. I can’t do that amount, and no time to do payment plans because I need to move ASAP.

I call them today to see if they will do a lower offer than that threshold. I offer pretty low like 30% just to start. The guy says typically 50% is where the settlement offer starts. That sounds pretty good but before I can even engage with the guy the line starts breaking up terribly and this guy transfers me.

 Now new guy says 70-80% is the lowest offer he will send to the school. I argue with him for a while for him to just send a lower offer. He won’t budge at about 62%. I tell him the other guy said 50% and he says he will have to review the call. 

So specifically, what is the reason why they can’t just send a low ball offer? It’s up to the school to decide if they will accept the amount so why can’t they just send any number I say?

,personalfinance,"Hello, I am a student who's trying to use this stay at home time trying to get his finances in order as best as possible especially after I had someone try to use one of my CC recently w/o my knowledge. I was hoping to get some advice here because I am still learning about finance on my own. 

I have been with 5/3 as my main bank for over a decade and basically have just used a checking account there. It was my first bank and the closest one to my house. So no problems really, but I did get a recent alert through my credit monitoring app that I had closed my 5/3 credit card (cc) account last week. Problem is I did not cancel my 5/3 credit card, I called 5/3 and they did it last week without alerting me (0$ balance on it). I was quite surprised since none of my 5/3 cards expire until 2021 so I dont know why they just chose to do it out of the blue. I am not the best at accounting, so I checked my transunion credit report and things seem fine so I am also asking here.

Also I saw my credit score dip 28 pts (pictured below) and on creditwise it was 48 pts lower in a day https://imgur.com/a/B6VNg8n


Questions:

A) If a bank closes one of your accounts with or without your knowledge can your credit score fall like 48 points in a day? How does this even work?

B) 5/3 asked me if I wanted to reopen the credit card (which I dont use), will this help raise my score back up?

C) What are some tips to raise my credit score back up since I've always tried to be careful with every dollar I spend. I have about $2500 balance on a 0% APR AMEX card and $5000 balance 8% APR on a capital one card I've had for over 10 years. Should I dip into my checking account (wanted to keep a balance here in case of emergency during these times) to pay these down?

D) I've been with 5/3 for a long time but I just felt the communication hasn't been that great from them and can't even recall ever getting alerts through mail, phone, or their online portal. What is the safest way to change my bank which includes 2 checking accounts, a savings account, since I have never worked with any other bank before?

E) Any easy to read materials for a novice who doesnt know much about finance to learn?

,personalfinance,"Hi, r/personalfinance. I have a (potentially dumb) question regarding loan repayment strategies. I have a significant amount of student loan debt that I'm pretty sure I'll be able to handle just fine (job starting in the fall, thankfully), but I want to make sure I pay it all off optimally. I looked at the PF wiki for loan repayment, which only mentioned the avalanche and snowball methods. I get that the snowball method might be helpful for some people, but I think the avalanche method will work best for me--that is, at least in principle.

For some background: I have several loan ""groups"" varying in interest rates (\~3.5–7.8%) and in ""current payoff"" balances (\~$3k–23k). The avalanche method is described in the wiki as ""paying off the highest interest loans first.""

I am wondering if the avalanche method means that I should still direct all my payments toward the loans with the highest interests, even if their current payoff balances (which I gather are the principals + already-accrued interest) are lower than other loans. To make things more concrete, would it make more sense to pay off Loan A with a $26k balance at 6% or Loan B with a $17k balance at 7%? Obviously, Loan A will accrue more interest over the next year or so than Loan B, which makes me question whether the avalanche method's directive is universally applicable.

I'm guessing that it (at least) partially depends on the time it would take for me to pay off the loans  and go on to the next ones, so is there a way for me to make this kind of calculation based on my income/the portion of my income that I'm confident I'll be able to direct toward my student loans? I haven't been able to find any kind of online calculator that is capable of going into such specific details—if there is one out there that I missed, a link would be deeply appreciated.

,personalfinance,"Hello, I moved to the US from Canada about 10 months ago for work.  I am in the US under the TN status under NAFTA, which is a non-immigrant status.  I'm not sure how long I'll be here in the US (might be a few years or several).

I have been maxing out my Roth IRA and my tax-deferred retirement plan, which I am now starting to realize might be a mistake due to the penalties of withdrawing the funds if I ever decide to move back to Canada.

,personalfinance,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Back in the 1950's my grandma bought a house. I believe she owned the house. She lived in it until 2001, when my mom and I moved in. My mom currently lives there. This year, I would like to buy the house from my mom so she can move in with her boyfriend and retire. 

The issue is, according to county tax records, my mom only paid $1 for the house when she took it from my grandma in 2001. I can't figure it out. Back then, it was valued at ~$150K. It is currently valued at ~$500K, which is around what I will offer her for it.

I don't know why it was recorded as $1, but now I'm very concerned that my mom will be taxed unnecessarily for this sale, when that $1 figure does not represent the value of the house at the time of sale. My mom currently has a $200K mortgage on it, which she took out in 2016.

,personalfinance,"Hi Finance Gurus on Reddit!

I need your advice. I was recently laid off from my employer in late FEB 2020 from ole 'Rona, and I will not return to the same employer. When the market was in a down spiral, I also moved 100% of my 401k mutual fund investments to Money Market account to not lose more % of my total portfolio (I know...I know...rookie mistake, but whats done is now done....Lesson learned) and my overall portfolio went from $150k to $100k :(

I am 29 and believe to rollover my company sponsored 401k to a ROTH IRA would be in my best interest. I figure with 40ish years left until retirement, a ROTH conversion now makes the most sense - i bite the bullet and pay taxes now on $100k, and be able to withdraw the rewards of compound interest 40 years from now tax free in its totality.

Here is my logic and please let me know where this doesnt make sense:

1. I understand that I will owe Federal and State Income Taxes on that $100k - but if there is a brightside to my story, I now dont have to pay taxes on $150k hahaha
2. I forsee the majority of this year job hunting and free-lancing work so WITHOUT the $100k I expect to be in the lowest tax bracket for 2020 single filers - 10% (less than $9,875 annual income)
3. I know that I can split the rollover into X% per year to allow me to stay in a lower tax bracket. So for example, 2020's 12% Tax bracket is $9,876 to $40,125. So if I rolled over, say 33%, I would only owe 12% of $33k rather than 24% of $100k. In this example, I am taking three years to roll it all over, paying $12,030 total in federal taxes over 3 years  vs $19,200 for taxes owed this year.
4. Using the previous example, I understand that would I lose the magic compound interest if I break up the rollover into 3 years. If I go ahead and transfer the full $100k, by the end of that third year, I believe that $100k would be larger than rolling over $33k for three years, and be large enough to offset the tax differential.
5. Plus THIS year, I know what my federal tax bracket will be (10%) and I can plan accordingly. The next three years I will not know what my tax bracket will be.
6. I thought about rolling over $30k in Dec 2020 and then the other $70k in Jan 2021. That way, they hit different tax years AND I wont lose the compound interest opportunity because I will be with the full $100k within weeks of each other. 
7. As I mentioned, i am 100% in money market accounts. If I invest back into mutual funds and wait until Dec to rollover, my account will be (hopefully) larger, and I will owe more taxes than rolling over today.

So should I rollover now? Other plans/strategies I havent considered?

I'm thinking I might be better off going all in on the Fidelity 500 Index (I'm guessing this is basically the S&amp;P 500?) or maybe that one and some others. Eventually I would start moving money into bonds. What do you guys think?

,personalfinance,"Hello,

I am looking for financial advise about whether or not I should sell my car.

I am 23 years old and will be moving soon. My salary will be 65k and a little over 48k after tax. I am currently 14k in debt. 7k are student loans and 7k are student loans I used for my car.

I have a 2015 Honda Civic LX about 75k miles. I purchased it in 2017 for about 11k. I’m moving to a city where I won’t really need my car and the apartment garage fees are expensive ($185 a month). I’m quite sure I’m going to leave it at my family’s house in the garage while I work for 2-3 years. 

My question is: should I sell my car or keep it?

If I keep my car, I will be paying about $600 a month for 24 months to get rid of my debt. I won’t be struggling and I will still have money for rent, spending, saving, etc. 

However, if I sale my car, for 7k-9k I could apply that directly to my debt and cut my debt in half. I could then greatly increase my savings ratio and pay the rest of my debt quicker and thus owe less on interest. My concern however is that if I decide to go to graduate school (currently that is the plan) and move then I will likely need a car. And then I’ll end up still needing to take from my savings to purchase a car (I would likely get a used Honda Civic again but a later model and stay in the 10-12k budget).

Currently my budget is:

~$4000 after tax

$1500 toward rent and utilities
$1000 in spending
$500 savings 
$600 in debt
$400 (this May go to savings or may go to health- considering getting braces again, etc.)

However if I sold my car I would lower my debt and increase savings substantially but con is I may have to repurchase car anyways in 2-3 years.

Thank you.

,personalfinance,"**(1) We've got a windfall coming in, in the next 30 days.** We bought some company stock options from a startup I worked at a few years ago. I now have a private buyer and the company looks ready to approve the transaction in the next 30 days. We should be clearing a (totally unexpected windfall) profit of nearly $360K.  I would say two months ago we thought the stock would be worthless, so this is a real unexpected boon.

**(2)If we change nothing, we will owe $104K in taxes on the $360K.  But We were already planning a relocation sometime this year to the Vermont/New Hampshire border from California.** We were starting to shop around for a mortgage and have done a lot of online looking. Have pretty much picked our community and were ready to do a visit. We haven't spent a lot of time in the area. Our original plan was to go for a Reconaissance trip once COVID restrictions eased, and probably buy in the summer and move in by fall.

Now we're wondering if we should speed up our move (during COVID) to see if we can avoid the California capital gains tax.

[This calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) says we will pay:

$103,880 in California  
$81,196 in New Hampshire  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**$22,684 in Savings**  


**We are looking at a $22,684 savings if we relocate before the transaction goes through.** Is it worth it to take the risk on jumping across country in the next 30 days (and skip our reconnaissance period, etc. to save the tax money?)

**How do we de-risk a sudden move?** We were \*pretty sure\* we wanted to go to this area but really hoped to check it out more before we made things permanent. We haven't spent any time there yet, but have researched it extensively, checked out schools and housing, etc.

Questions:

* *Is the state that collects capital gains based on where you're living on the date of the transaction? What is the ""datestamp"" they look at to know if you get taxed in one state or another?*
* Could I just rent a new ""primary residence"" in New Hampshire for a few months, then we buy another residence later in the year (maybe in VT?), and have that be workable?

Details:

* Family of 4, annual income around $250K with fully remote job.
* Currently renting month-to-month in California at a high rental rate.
* Planning to buy our first home this year.
* We are in a good financial position generally, with 250K for our downpayment + other savings and healthy retirement and college funds set aside. ***We don't \*need\* the 22K, but hey, it's 22k.***",t2_h0kory8,False,,0,False,"Should we speed up our move from CA &gt; NH in the next 30 days to save 22K in (sudden, windfall) capital gains taxes?",[],r/personalfinance,False,6,Taxes,0,False,t3_gj7cjw,False,light,0.84,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Taxes,False,4,,False,,1589403323.0,,[],{},,True,,1589431449.0,text,6,,,text,self.personalfinance,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) We&amp;#39;ve got a windfall coming in, in the next 30 days.&lt;/strong&gt; We bought some company stock options from a startup I worked at a few years ago. I now have a private buyer and the company looks ready to approve the transaction in the next 30 days. We should be clearing a (totally unexpected windfall) profit of nearly $360K.  I would say two months ago we thought the stock would be worthless, so this is a real unexpected boon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)If we change nothing, we will owe $104K in taxes on the $360K.  But We were already planning a relocation sometime this year to the Vermont/New Hampshire border from California.&lt;/strong&gt; We were starting to shop around for a mortgage and have done a lot of online looking. Have pretty much picked our community and were ready to do a visit. We haven&amp;#39;t spent a lot of time in the area. Our original plan was to go for a Reconaissance trip once COVID restrictions eased, and probably buy in the summer and move in by fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;re wondering if we should speed up our move (during COVID) to see if we can avoid the California capital gains tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator""&gt;This calculator&lt;/a&gt; says we will pay:&lt;/p&gt;

$81,196 in New Hampshire&lt;br/&gt;
______________________________&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$22,684 in Savings&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are looking at a $22,684 savings if we relocate before the transaction goes through.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it worth it to take the risk on jumping across country in the next 30 days (and skip our reconnaissance period, etc. to save the tax money?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we de-risk a sudden move?&lt;/strong&gt; We were *pretty sure* we wanted to go to this area but really hoped to check it out more before we made things permanent. We haven&amp;#39;t spent any time there yet, but have researched it extensively, checked out schools and housing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the state that collects capital gains based on where you&amp;#39;re living on the date of the transaction? What is the &amp;quot;datestamp&amp;quot; they look at to know if you get taxed in one state or another?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Real short backstory, had really great credit a few years ago and trusted family with my credit card for some support - turned out badly and was in debt for 2-3k. Made payments for a while until I lost my job and couldn't afford to, consequently I had my debt sold. Collectors tried for a while to collect then stopped? It went on unpaid for a long time.

Today i received a debt settlement offer for 50% of my total debt from my bank which I'm interested in taking. But before i got this letter i was intending on writing a letter to the credit unions (or however)  to pay off the debt in exchange of removal of the bad marks to fix my score.

,personalfinance,"I'm looking for advice/help, (for reference i live in canada/toronto).

I have an online credit card with a bank (mbna.ca) , some back story, I have had this card for 6 years and have never made a single purchase on it because I exclusively use it to hold debt at times due to their low interest rate.

About a little over a month ago I received a phone call from [infoprotector.ca](https://www.infoprotector.ca/), this company claim to be calling **on behalf of MBNA** and were offering a credit protection plan of some sort which I quickly denied. A few weeks later they sent me a physical mail pamphlet which i just threw out cause I was by no means interest in their service.

Surprise surprise 2 weeks later I got charged ($100) for this service that I never authorized, wanted nor gave my credit card info to. In fact like i said above I have never made any purchase with this credit card so the only explanation is that they somehow got the info from my bank, which makes sense since they literally said they were calling on behalf of MBNA.

I tried to contact MBNA about it and they quickly turn me down and asked me to contact infoprotect first. Turns out their phone number cant be called due to covid19 so I had to send them an email which two weeks later is still unanswered.

I went back to my bank to try and report their fraud but they once again said there is nothing they can do about it cause is a third party. After a lot of back and forth and getting transfer through every department, they ended up transferring me to the dispute department which I waited for one hour and they never pick up despite every other department picking up within 1 minute.

Is becoming quite clear to me that they aren't gonna help me and are defiantly in on the fraud, so I'm just wondering what are the best next steps for me take? also wondering if anyone else with this bank has had similar issues?

,personalfinance,"I know I'm going to get downvotes for this since I'm going against the grain, I'm ready for them.

I am self employed. Personal finance wisdom seems to suggest that I use Roth IRA (USA) to save for retirement. I have done my research on Roth IRA's and I do not like what I have found so far.

- Subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty. I am young and I plan to FIRE. I do not want this money tied up for another 30 years. Maybe I FIRE, maybe I want to take a sabbatical, maybe I want to pay rent with investments for awhile, etc.
- Early withdrawal regulations for Roth IRA's are complex. I'll read articles that say things like ""Roth IRA withdrawals are penalty free"" and ""Roth IRA's incur a 10% withdrawal penalty"" and these contradictory phrases will be side by side in the same article.
- All this work to waive a 15% capital gains tax. Income tax is already paid. Doesn't seem like much benefit just to waive 15% capital gains tax.
- My brokerage bank, Ally, doesn't appear to have Roth IRA brokerage accounts. [Only CD and savings.](https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/ira-account/). So I would have to split into 2 brokerage accounts at different banks, which increases complexity. And the second bank would probably charge fees (Ally doesn't charge account fees or trade commissions for the type of trading I do)
- There are major limits on how much can be contributed per year. $6000 seems very low. I like having a minimum number of bank accounts (one checking, one brokerage) and just glancing at one dashboard. I don't really want to make multiple bank accounts at multiple banks just for $6000/yr.

It sounds like there's 3 scenarios that I can be put in:

- Roth IRA, no early withdrawal - I don't withdrawal my money for 30 years and I get 0% capital gains tax
- Roth IRA, early withdrawal - I withdrawal my money early and have to pay 15% capital gains tax + 10% withdrawal penalty = 25%.
- Taxable Account- I keep my single brokerage account (simplicity), and my freedom to withdrawal whenever I want, and just pay a flat 15% no matter when I withdraw.

,personalfinance,"I currently live in a condo(paid-off), and plan to expand into a house in the next 1-2 years to support my growing family.  
I need help figuring out what numbers or considerations I should be looking at when deciding whether to sell or rent out my current Condo.

My goals are ease of mind, while still not heavily affecting my retirement savings(50% there).

Here's a few numbers.  
Condo costed me **$170k**, would sell for **$200k**(minus $10k for fees).  
Rent in my area is **$1600**. But I have the following monthly costs:  
$320/month HOA fees, $390/month property tax, $20/month insurance. 

New house price target is **$400k**(I have 20% saved up).

**My options are:**

1. Rent out the Condo, and use the $800 cash flow towards the payment of the new house.
2. Sell the condo, use the $190k as a down payment, to lower the house's monthly payments.

I need help figuring out what numbers or considerations I should be looking at when deciding whether to sell or rent out my current Condo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals are ease of mind, while still not heavily affecting my retirement savings(50% there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a few numbers.&lt;br/&gt;
Condo costed me &lt;strong&gt;$170k&lt;/strong&gt;, would sell for &lt;strong&gt;$200k&lt;/strong&gt;(minus $10k for fees).&lt;br/&gt;
Rent in my area is &lt;strong&gt;$1600&lt;/strong&gt;. But I have the following monthly costs:&lt;br/&gt;
$320/month HOA fees, $390/month property tax, $20/month insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New house price target is &lt;strong&gt;$400k&lt;/strong&gt;(I have 20% saved up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My options are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent out the Condo, and use the $800 cash flow towards the payment of the new house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell the condo, use the $190k as a down payment, to lower the house&amp;#39;s monthly payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell the condo, invest the $190k in the S&amp;amp;P500.&lt;/li&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hey Reddit,

I consider taking out a private student loan. I know it should be the last resort but I do not know what else I can do. Right now I need to make a choice: either accept the fact that every resume of mine or any application form I have to fill out will always contain ""Education: High School Diploma"" or take out $50,000 in loans to pay the tuition fees and housing. Honestly, I do not know which of the two is worse. I have done all I can to avoid taking out a private loan. I have completed two years at a community college, knocking out all of the utterly useless general education requirements, and have transferred to a local university (not a top university, but quite decent). I'm a math major and intend to go to graduate school for a statistics degree. Now, the university I transferred to, has not offered me anything but federal loans. The federal loans cover only half of the tuition each semester. On top of that, I will be living in a $400-$500 apartment close to campus. Also, I will not be working during the first semester at the new school, since I intend to take a quite heavy course load so that I can graduate in two years and have a good chance at being accepted to a Ph.D. program. I understand that taking private loans should be the last resort, but I have exhausted all options. I have also considered taking Parent Plus loans, but since I will be 24 years old next semester, I will not be eligible for that. Thus, private loans.

Currently, as an in-state resident, I will need to pay $8,500 in tuition fees per semester. I also estimate that I would need about $6000 per year to pay rent plus food. Thus, two semesters at university would cost me $23,000. I need to complete four semesters, hence $46,000 for a B.A in Pure Mathematics. I intend to go to grad school right after undergrad and would like to defer payments until after I finish the graduate program. On the bright side, I will be 24 next year and will be considered an independent student, so I hope the university will take that into consideration and offer me some financial aid.

Now, the reason I'm typing all this: I need your advice on what private student loan lenders I should consider? In particular, I need to pick one that would allow me to DEFER payments until I finish graduate school. I have talked with Sallie Mae about Smart Option Student Loan, and they said that I would be able to defer payments until after I finish grad school. But I'm not sure I believe that. They told me that I would need to call an agent after completing undergrad so that they would defer payments. Could anyone confirm that it's true? If no, what other private loan providers should I consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify a few things. I was awarded $3500 in Stafford loans per semester.

Thank you!",t2_36cf1yce,False,,0,False,What private student loans should I consider for getting a B.A in Pure Mathematics?,[],r/personalfinance,False,6,Debt,0,False,t3_gj6mi0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Debt,False,1,,False,,1589404339.0,,[],{},,True,,1589429258.0,text,6,,,text,self.personalfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider taking out a private student loan. I know it should be the last resort but I do not know what else I can do. Right now I need to make a choice: either accept the fact that every resume of mine or any application form I have to fill out will always contain &amp;quot;Education: High School Diploma&amp;quot; or take out $50,000 in loans to pay the tuition fees and housing. Honestly, I do not know which of the two is worse. I have done all I can to avoid taking out a private loan. I have completed two years at a community college, knocking out all of the utterly useless general education requirements, and have transferred to a local university (not a top university, but quite decent). I&amp;#39;m a math major and intend to go to graduate school for a statistics degree. Now, the university I transferred to, has not offered me anything but federal loans. The federal loans cover only half of the tuition each semester. On top of that, I will be living in a $400-$500 apartment close to campus. Also, I will not be working during the first semester at the new school, since I intend to take a quite heavy course load so that I can graduate in two years and have a good chance at being accepted to a Ph.D. program. I understand that taking private loans should be the last resort, but I have exhausted all options. I have also considered taking Parent Plus loans, but since I will be 24 years old next semester, I will not be eligible for that. Thus, private loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, as an in-state resident, I will need to pay $8,500 in tuition fees per semester. I also estimate that I would need about $6000 per year to pay rent plus food. Thus, two semesters at university would cost me $23,000. I need to complete four semesters, hence $46,000 for a B.A in Pure Mathematics. I intend to go to grad school right after undergrad and would like to defer payments until after I finish the graduate program. On the bright side, I will be 24 next year and will be considered an independent student, so I hope the university will take that into consideration and offer me some financial aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the reason I&amp;#39;m typing all this: I need your advice on what private student loan lenders I should consider? In particular, I need to pick one that would allow me to DEFER payments until I finish graduate school. I have talked with Sallie Mae about Smart Option Student Loan, and they said that I would be able to defer payments until after I finish grad school. But I&amp;#39;m not sure I believe that. They told me that I would need to call an agent after completing undergrad so that they would defer payments. Could anyone confirm that it&amp;#39;s true? If no, what other private loan providers should I consider?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should clarify a few things. I was awarded $3500 in Stafford loans per semester. That means I would need to find an additional $5000 to pay off the rest of the tuition, and hence I&amp;#39;m considering taking out a private loan. In total,  I would need to borrow $14,000 in Stafford loans and about $32,000 in private loans to pay for the entire undergrad degree. Secondly, I should have mentioned something about the career I&amp;#39;m pursuing -- machine learning (basically applied statistics). It&amp;#39;s quite difficult to get a job in the industry straight out of undergrad unless you go to a top school, so most ML positions require a graduate degree. What I&amp;#39;m worried about is that  I won&amp;#39;t be allowed to defer payments and would need to start paying off the undergrad debt while in grad school. &lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"A few years ago I made an impulsive decision and bought a 2007 Boxster while I was 19 and still living at home. I bought it for $18kish and ended up putting around $10k worth of repairs into it over the course of the last few years (IMS bearing is a killer). It's all paid off and I am no longer living at home. After those repairs I said to myself I would run it into the ground to make it worth the money I threw at it.

While I still absolutely love the car, it doesn't have quite the same ""wow"" factor it once had. It has 69,000 miles on it so the plan would be to hopefully sell it for around $13k and buy a newer cheaper car for $8k leaving me with an extra $5kish to put towards a down payment on my first house (which I don't plan on looking for one for another year and a half. It also wouldn't make or break the down payment.)

The financially responsible thing to me would be to sell it, but I still really enjoy driving it and every other car I touch just seems off. Idk if that's simply because I'm not used to them. I'm afraid the minute I sell it I would regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

 

I placed an online order of coffee machine ($3119.43) from Wayfair on December 20th of 2019. The item supposed to arrive on the Dec 23rd and I received a box empty. I called Wayfair immediately for help on the same night and they told me to dispute the charge since they couldn’t help with that. I called Chase the next morning to start the dispute process (December 24th). Soon after the call with Chase the item showed up at my door but at this point it was too late. The item was supposed to be the Xmas gift for my friend and I received after Xmas so there was no point to keep. I already initiated the dispute with Chase earlier so I called Chase again to cancel the dispute and start the return process to receive my money back because it would be wrong to start a dispute but having an item in hand. I mailed it back to Wayfair on the 26th of December around 12:24 PM with the tracking number and I received a refund confirmation from the email for the refund of $3069.85 immediately after I dropped of the package (full amount minus the shipping charge of $49.58). Ever since then I have never received the refund from Wayfair for the any amount whatsoever. I called Wayfair after one week to check my refund status and they told me they received the item back and they are now aware of the dispute I placed. I told Wayfair I canceled the dispute, returned the item back to Wayfair and all I need know is to receive a refund because technicially the dispute was cancelled and I returned the merchandise. They agreed to it and the last communication I received from Wayfair was around January 3rd. Wayfair told me they already refunded me but I wasn’t sure if they referenced to the dispute or the actual item that I returned back to them. After a few weeks of unsuccessfully retrieving the refund, I went back to Chase and re-initiated the dispute with my credit card company on January of 26th providing all the information I had at the time including the tracking number and the refund confirmation email from Wayfair but I never received any money back. Ever since the reopen dispute with Chase in the late of January I never heard back from Chase or any updates from Chase. I assumed they were taking time to investigate because of the complication process (open-cancel-reopen) and with the COVID-19 I thought the process was taking longer than usual. However, on April 3rd, Chase sent me the later saying the charge is valid  and the fund were returned back to Wayfair on 1/7/2020 when I canceled the dispute on 12/26/2020. Chase cannot assist me any further. It is up to Wayfair to find the fund. I was furious and lost so I decided to call Wayfair and Chase again as a liaison to ask for the latest status. I spoke to this person named C from Advocacy team from Wayfair (4/24/2020) and was advised that Wayfair accepted the dispute report received from my bank and accepted the refund credit to be issued to me through my financial institution which doesn’t make any sense. I thought she referenced the original dispute so I had to send an email and explain the whole story to her but she never responded. I decided to call Chase again and spoke to B (Chase Dispute Supervisor) and she said that Chase already canceled the refund and the fund went back to Wayfair and advised me to call Wayfair to ask them where the fund is (I found this similar to the letter I received from Chase on April 3rd). At this point I was transferred to J who is also the customer advocacy at Wayfair (4/27/2020) and she advised me if Chase already canceled the refund then it would be an ARN number (confirmation number?) showing the bank send the funds over to Wayfair. I called Chase again and spoke to B this morning (5/5/2020) and asked her what the ARN number would be when Chase sent back the fund to Wayfair and she didn’t know but keep telling me to wait and wait. B mentioned that it should take up to 45 days for the merchant to receive the fund back to their bank account but it looks like it has been almost 130 days at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

After too long to handle this issue, I finally filed a complaint with Chase on CFPB to get more lights regarding this whole issue. I thought the issue could be solved but Chase Excutive team got back to me with the same response that I received from Chase Dispute Team but now having the ARN number. I was so happy and thought this will help me very much. I gave Wayfair the official letter with all related information but as of this morning I received a call from Wayfair saying the ARN number I provided was the first ARN number when I initiated the dispute. The second ARN (rebill) couldn't be locate and they have no clue. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the letter I received from Chase.

""We completed our research into your $3,119.43 charge from WAYFAIR\*Wayfair that posted to your

account on December 22, 2019. On December 25, we issued a temporary credit for $3,119.43 because

requested to cancel the dispute. We rebilled the charge to your account on December 26 as you

requested. We sent our enclosed letter dated December 27 to let you know we rebilled your account. 

We have enclosed your January 2020 billing statement, which shows the rebilled charge.

The merchant accepted your dispute on January 7, 2020, but we returned the funds of $3,119.43 to the

merchant’s bank on January 7 because you canceled the dispute on December 26, 2019.

We have reviewed all documentation you have provided to obtain a refund. We are not able to reopen the dispute as the funds were returned to the merchant’s bank on January 7, 2020. We apologize for the delay in our response when you sent an email on January 27. We show that we sent our enclosed letter dated February 27 informing you the funds were returned to the merchant’s bank.

We ask that you contact the merchant to resolve this matter. The acquirer reference number (ARN) is

to you as we do not have the funds. The rebilled charge will remain valid including any associated interest or fees. In addition, we have enclosed our letters dated April 3 and April 18 to let you know we are not able to issue a refund.""

,personalfinance,"I got an email from Vanguard because they received my bill pay check from the bank for depositing money to my IRA. The email says that starting July 15th, they will no longer be accepting deposits in this manner. They suggest that I add my bank account number to their site so they can pull the money in, or that I can upload paper checks to their app for deposit. I called to express my displeasure, but I'm curious. Are people ok with this? Am I in the minority for being pissed that such a basic thing as bank bill pay is being removed as an option?

My reasoning for not attaching my bank info to Vanguard is firstly that I don't let people pull from my bank. I only push money out. And secondly it's stupid for me to give 10 institutions my info for them to pull instead of one institution instructions to push. I can't imagine what a pain it the ass it would be to change banks and have to go to everyone that I pay and switch the account information. Why would I consider that when I can just use bill pay to organize everything in one place?

As for the app, I guess that's a somewhat reasonable option other than the fact that I only keep about ten checks for my bank account. I mean, who uses paper checks anymore? Not me, because *I use bill pay* for everything that can't be done with my credit card. If need be, I guess I will go with this option and probably only send money in once a quarter or so.

Vanguard says that they're trying to increase processing times and decrease situations where they aren't sure how the money should be treated. But...that just doesn't fly for me.

,personalfinance,"So...I want to get a cheap used car soon, but I found out that my parents have a weird insurance scheme.

My father wants me to change the address on my license and put the car title in my mother's name (my dad doesn't work, so everything is in her name), because then they'll just add me as a named driver and will get cheaper insurance that way.

I won't be putting her name on the title because I'm the one paying for the car. I'm also pretty sure that I'm required to be on the insurance anyway, because I live at the same residence.

My father is actually pretending to not be married to my mother, and has a different address on his license. I heard her and him on the phone with the insurance company, and my mother clearly said she was single. My parents have been married since before I was born.

So. My parents are refusing to budge. I don't want to commit fraud by pretending we're not related or like I live somewhere else. I also really will not ever put their names on my car title because I don't want to deal with their scams. They actually got audited by the IRS awhile ago...and I'm suspicious they just want the title in their names to steal it from me.

What can I do? The issue is that I think my father may have excluded me from the car insurance without telling me, like filling out the exclusion form and sending it to the insurance company. I got my license last year and from what I've read, I should have been automatically added to the policy by the company whether my parents wanted it or not. My father handles all the finances and will do anything to save money.

But I don't know what really happened or what to do or anything really...

**As a sidenote:** My parents for some reason keep pretending to want to buy me a car and then pull out at the last minute. The most recent incident was my father saying he'll make my mother give me $5,000 after they sell their house, so I can pay for college or a car. He wants to pay half and I pay the other half. But my parents have never helped me out financially and especially not with big purchases. I mentioned buying a car with 100% my money, and neither of them seemed to care.

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t be putting her name on the title because I&amp;#39;m the one paying for the car. I&amp;#39;m also pretty sure that I&amp;#39;m required to be on the insurance anyway, because I live at the same residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father is actually pretending to not be married to my mother, and has a different address on his license. I heard her and him on the phone with the insurance company, and my mother clearly said she was single. My parents have been married since before I was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. My parents are refusing to budge. I don&amp;#39;t want to commit fraud by pretending we&amp;#39;re not related or like I live somewhere else. I also really will not ever put their names on my car title because I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with their scams. They actually got audited by the IRS awhile ago...and I&amp;#39;m suspicious they just want the title in their names to steal it from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do? The issue is that I think my father may have excluded me from the car insurance without telling me, like filling out the exclusion form and sending it to the insurance company. I got my license last year and from what I&amp;#39;ve read, I should have been automatically added to the policy by the company whether my parents wanted it or not. My father handles all the finances and will do anything to save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t know what really happened or what to do or anything really...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a sidenote:&lt;/strong&gt; My parents for some reason keep pretending to want to buy me a car and then pull out at the last minute. The most recent incident was my father saying he&amp;#39;ll make my mother give me $5,000 after they sell their house, so I can pay for college or a car. He wants to pay half and I pay the other half. But my parents have never helped me out financially and especially not with big purchases. I mentioned buying a car with 100% my money, and neither of them seemed to care. Is it possible my father is pretending to offer me $5K to entice me to give him money so he can steal it? Has anyone heard of that before?&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"TLDR; Great Lakes submitted the WRONG student loan status code to the three credit bureaus for ALL of their customers with student loans (as part of the CARES act) and it's causing everyone's credit scores to drop 40-50 points.

I'm in the midst of buying a house and my lender pulled my credit yesterday. She told me what it was and I was shocked, it was lower than I thought. I know numbers fluctuate from free services like Discover and Credit Karma, so I looked at Credit Karma to see the numbers from two of the bureaus, and sure enough, a MAJOR drop of 45 points on both of them over a 4 day update period. I know the numbers themselves aren't super accurate, but the trends sure are.

I saw some articles on this subreddit today alluding to this issue but I wanted to verify the info. I googled and found ONE article about this [here](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/student-loan-borrowers-discover-significant-drop-credit-score-following-cares-act-protections/DBNHS5ODKBCNHOE7VKU3RWNFVI/). It was actually pretty informative and accurate.

I called Great Lakes and a woman confirmed that it was true: their company had provided the wrong 'code' to the credit bureaus, essentially causing everyone's student loans to look they are in REAL forbearance/deferral. I asked if it was worth looking at my account to see if I was one of the ones affected and she told me that it wasn't necessary because it affected everyone across the board. Wut.

My follow up was 'when is this going to be fixed?' and she said on May 31st they send their normal monthly report to the three bureaus and it will have the correction in there and will set everyone's accounts back (yeah right! Trust but verify!). As for when the bureaus will fix it once they receive the new information, I am still sitting on hold with one of them now to find out.

The last thing I asked her was if this was written publicly anywhere so that I can show my lender proof of this information. She said that they don't have it posted anywhere. WTF! No press release, no statement, NOTHING. Feels weird to know about something that affects so many people, yet there's only one article on it.

I'll update this post once I talk to someone at TransUnion. What a crazy year.

**EDIT: Since Credit Karma pulls Vantage Scores, I wanted to see what my FICO scores were. I signed up for a free trial with Experian's service that gives me access to all 3 bureaus' credit FICO 8 scores. It also has, just for Experian scores, a breakdown of a specific credit score for mortgage, auto lending, and credit cards. The  only one that was slightly low, at the level my lender would have seen, was the mortgage one. I cannot see 'trends' here to see if it had dropped recently.**

**Conclusively, I cannot confirm yet for SURE whether my lender uses a FICO 2, FICO 8, or Vantage score. Going to talk to them this morning.**

**EDIT: Sidenote cuz I thought this was pretty cool: as part of the trial of the experian service (and I would hope the other bureaus have something similar), you can use a 'score simulator' to click scenarios to see specifically what your credit score will do when you get a new credit card, pay off credit card balances, close down a credit card, etc. Thought that was pretty cool. It's only on the FICO 8 score model though, not the mortgage, auto, or credit card one.**

**EDIT: My mortgage lender talked to the credit company and they said they use the following scores to determine my rates:**  
**Experian: Fair Isaac v2**  
**Transunion - FICO Classic 4**  
**Equifax - FICO Classic**

**In conclusion, I'm calling this the ""Great"" Mishap of 2020.

,personalfinance,"Hi All, longtime reader but have a few questions, and a few more given the interesting circumstances that we're currently living through. 

I've been planning to purchase my first house for a little while now and been working towards it. I'm tired of paying rent and certain I'm staying in my current city for the foreseeable future considering my partner and I have started a business here. The rub is, I've gone quite a bit into credit card debt (around $15k) over the past 2 years as we got the business established. I'm back to a good paying job within my field and he has secured sales growth and funding to ensure his paycheck (and stability for business). 

It's definitely possible for us to  continue to work for another 1-2 years and aggressively pay down the debt while still renting. However, I'd really like to make the jump sooner rather than later if possible. My state has a first time home buyer down payment assistance grant that several friends have used and highly recommend, so I'll likely use that even if I do have a down payment of my own. We are not married so I will be purchasing the house myself as per advice I've seen on here (and he filed bankruptcy for medical debt 4 years ago as well, so part of the reason). 

Prior to the credit card debt I had excellent credit and my score is still impeccable outside of the high (95%) utilization rate. I've looked at some calculators and gotten advice, but it seems that in order to quality for my state's mortgage/down payment program I'll need to raise my credit score by substantially dropping my CC balances. I just so happen to have about $15k in 2 retirement accounts from previous jobs, one of which I need to roll over into a new account or at least address in some way. 

My long winded question is, could I use these retirement funds to wipe out my remaining credit card debt, raise my score, and finally begin the process of purchasing a home?

I've spent most of my life bouncing between good and bad credit.  I'm finally in a place where my debt is manageable and decreasing, and my credit report is free from derogatory accounts and information.

Because I spent half my life with poor credit, I am a huge advocate of teaching kids to manage their credit and finances as early as possible.  I spout off about it as often as possible, and I was pretty sure that no one listened.  Evidently my niece was actually paying attention!  Her mother is on the streets so she lives with one of my other sisters.  She asked if we could teach her about finances and good credit, something she knows nothing about.  I'm soooo excited to get her started!

That brings me to my question, what are the things that we should be educating our teens about to prepare them for their financial future?  I am thinking how to read a check stub, how taxes work, getting and maintaining a bank account (the minor bank account thread is what finally pushed me to ask this question), interest rates/credit cards/good vs. bad debt.

She tells me that it’s like life insurance, injury insurance, and investing all in one. Put away money and it’s tied in with the stock market so it can grow well over years, but somehow or another it does not ever lose money.

I know some cards have things like flight miles and stuff, but I'm really just looking for the lowest APR that won't screw me over the most since I know I won't be able to make full payments until I either pick up a second job, get moved up to a full-time professor (which is a laughable daydream these days even outside of the Plague), or my kid's dad starts giving more adequate financial support (even more laughable unless I take him to court with a magically provided lawyer).

I can&amp;#39;t administer fluids by myself due to a physical disability and not having a second set of hands to keep him steady/down. The only vet tech I could find who is still making house calls costs almost as much as my monthly income, about $300+ more than my rent, and my tax stimulus is almost gone. I have a pet care credit card with a $3000 limit for emergencies (currently at $0), so I&amp;#39;m trying not to take out a credit-credit card, but I know I will need to eventually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current credit score 713, which is decent, so I feel like I might be able to find a good deal, but my fear of credit cards is so deeply inculcated that I have no idea where to even look, especially since I know this is an indefinite situation (he&amp;#39;s responding very well to cat dialysis!!!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some cards have things like flight miles and stuff, but I&amp;#39;m really just looking for the lowest APR that won&amp;#39;t screw me over the most since I know I won&amp;#39;t be able to make full payments until I either pick up a second job, get moved up to a full-time professor (which is a laughable daydream these days even outside of the Plague), or my kid&amp;#39;s dad starts giving more adequate financial support (even more laughable unless I take him to court with a magically provided lawyer). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help a gal out?&lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently putting money away into a savings account for 3 things:

Im currently putting everything into the same account because it’s a very high interest account.

Is there a drawback if I separate this money into 3 different accounts?

Apologies if this isn't the appropriate sub for this. Please let me know if that's the case.

I'm 27 and 4(ish) years into my career (5 if you count part time work before graduation). I've worked at a few different places in my field at this point and have realized it's not my ""forever field"" if that makes sense. Around about a year in, I get tired of the job and move on to somewhere else. The problem is, I don't want to leave my current job just to go to another job and have the same thing happen. 

I think the main thing I have realized is that sitting at a desk for 40-45 hrs/wk is not my cup of tea. None of my hobbies outside of work involve being still, so why would my career? My hobbies are woodworking, gardening, and vehicle restoration. However, I'm not good enough to make any of these a well paying career. I have realized that I like being in motion and I like working with my hands. 

So...how did you switch fields for people who have? I make \~$50k per year and wouldn't be too happy taking a massive pay cut. I am currently paying of high-interest debt while I build my savings, so I don't have a substantial savings built up to where I could just leave. 

I realize this may not be the best economic environment to do this in, so I will likely stay put until I have something else secured. Just looking for options right now.

,personalfinance,"Hi all, 

I bought a pair of tickets for an annual concert that had been cancelled due to COVID 19. The organizer posted a statement saying no refund will be issued and simply make the tickets valid for next year. Their reasoning is that the concert is not ""cancelled"" but simply ""rescheduled to next year."" I find this illogical since how can someone reschedule an annual concert to next year? Also, I paid for this year concert not next year. I am not sure I can attend next year either. Anyways, my bank is Chase and I disputed the charge with them.

&lt;p&gt;I bought a pair of tickets for an annual concert that had been cancelled due to COVID 19. The organizer posted a statement saying no refund will be issued and simply make the tickets valid for next year. Their reasoning is that the concert is not &amp;quot;cancelled&amp;quot; but simply &amp;quot;rescheduled to next year.&amp;quot; I find this illogical since how can someone reschedule an annual concert to next year? Also, I paid for this year concert not next year. I am not sure I can attend next year either. Anyways, my bank is Chase and I disputed the charge with them.

Also in 3/2020 I refinanced my mortgage and the title company sent the county a $7000 check to cover any property tax due.  So by my calculations I need to pay $1000, due by 5/31.

However, the county's online tax portal says I still owe $8000.  The title company has sent me a copy of the cleared check which shows the County has received and deposited the funds, and the correct parcel number is clearly listed on the check.  

After multiple calls (with &gt;1 hour hold times), each time they say they have *not* received the check and transfer me to different offices/people who do not pick up.  I have emailed and faxed them the copy of the cleared check too. I cannot go to the their offices (closed due to COVID), and there seems to be nobody at the County who can give me a straight answer.

**Question**:  I have a feeling it's going to take a while for them to ""find"" the $7000 they already deposited.  But since the $8000 is due before May 31, do I:

* A) Pay the county only the balance I think is due ($1000)?  I am sure if I only give them $1000 they will charge me penalties (and maybe place a lien on my house?) which will take multiple phone calls to reverse once they find the $7000.

* B) Pay the entire tax bill ($8000)  and then try to appeal for a refund later?  At least this way I won't get penalties/lien assessed, but I have a feeling it will be an uphill battle to recover my $7000 overpayment.

Current thought is to pay $8,300 (all cash on hand) towards my $11,000 personal credit card which will bring me down under 30% utilization having somewhat of a decent impact onto credit score. Along with this, I plan to get added onto my father's credit card and piggyback off of his 800+ credit score. I've heard this is a great thing to do, obviously only if that person is reliable. 

Wait a couple of months to have that impact hit my credit score then attempt to apply for a 0% balance transfer for 18 months credit card. If approved, hopefully for a decent amount, I will then transfer my business card debt to the new card paying monthly without getting interest charges. If that all works out I can attack this debt over the 18 months and have it paid off. 

The only concern so far is student loan debt. I have not made any payments towards it and hopefully will have bigger cashflow by September to make big impact payments.

,personalfinance,"Hi everyone,

This subreddit is AMAZING. Thanks to whoever created this, and thanks to everyone who contributes. 

So I've been doing reading through some posts, and I want to make sure I make sense...

I'm 28 (I know...pretty late), and I finished graduate school at the end of summer 2019. I'm not working at all right now, and I'm living at home. The job search hasn't been that great to me, unfortunately. I left my part-time job in January to focus more on the job search...then the pandemic hit. -\_-

My expenses at the moment are very minimal: Car and car insurance expenses, groceries, and store credit cards. I deferred my graduate student loans another year based on the income I made at my previous job. I don't have a 401K because either I've worked part-time jobs or IC jobs. 

I got approved for UI, and I should be getting my card in the mail by the end of the week. I chose to withhold taxes on my UI funds.

This is the plan I have for the next two months (hopefully this is correct): 

1. Pay off store credit cards - $2000 worth
2. Create an emergency fund through a high yield savings account. Planning to put the settlement I received from a car accident into this account. Seems like Capital One, Ally, and Discover are the big contenders from what I'm reading.
3. Open a Roth IRA. Seems like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard are the most popular ones. Sidenote, I honestly don't think I'll be getting married for another 5 years.
4. Start life insurance back up again. I was planning on doing this when I get my FT role.

Would love feedback on my plan, but I do have questions:

1. How did you decide on which bank/brokerage was for you? 
2. For the Roth IRA, I can definitely contribute to 2019 at the max with part of the settlement, but I already filed my taxes back in February. My income for 2019 was less than $20K. Did I qualify for the Saver's Credit? If so, do I need to file an amendment?
3. When I do open the Roth IRA, should I go for a target date fund? Or...?
4. Lastly, I have Series EE savings bonds that I received between the ages of 0-13. Two of them will be at maturity in 18 months, the others are halfway matured. I've checked the values of all of them already. Should I wait until all of the bonds are matured? I don't really have a need for using them at the moment, other than saving up for my own place in the future.

They have two cars with loans out on both. Thousands of dollars of debt. With just the cars, car insurance, phone bills, storage rental, and whatever essential bills they have to pay, they have around 800 in monthly expenses.

- I want to immediately go in with £1000 but then monthly add to this with a couple hundred, is this advisable or is it better to save and stick with bigger lump sums?

- I was looking at opening a shares account through my bank but are there any other places I should look first?

- Also what sort of estimated return % would you guess based on past experience, I know this isn't gospel and nothing is guaranteed.

I'm a bit worried about things like HOA fees, or other fees that I am not aware about that comes with the condo ownership.

Small breakdown of what I have so far:

Water, Trash and Gas is paid for by the HOA, which is $300 a month. (Is this a good price? it seems like it to me)

Electric bill we would split.

HOA fee would normally be the landlord's expense (I think), so I would pay this.

Taxes are defindelty the landlord's expense, which according to the 2019 past owner's tax bill receipt is around $1,000 a year.

I am attempting to understand New York state and city withholding allowances. I am attempting to lower the amount of state and city taxes withheld from my paycheck so I can afford to increase my contributions to my 401k. 

2020 total salary: $100,000

Existing withholding allowances: 2 federal (I understand I can increase this on new W4 based on 401k contribution - this is more straightforward to me), 0 state, 0 new york city.

I have been using the New York tax form IT-2104 to figure this out. Link: [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opa/taxes/determining-withholding-allowances.page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opa/taxes/determining-withholding-allowances.page)

For the final part of the exercise, in Part 5, line 35, the only applicable allowances to me come from the line 16: ""enter your adjustments to federable taxable income, such as deductible IRA contributions..."" 

For line 16, for example, I would put 15 if I anticipated contributing $15,000 to my 401k in 2020. Is this correct? This would mean I would claim 15 total allowances?

I believe I am doing something wrong because when I then used a separate calculator, it said the maximum # of allowances is 14?

I want to buy a new to me (so used) car. I have $5,000 saved up, and the car I have right now could probably get me $2,000. 

The cars I am looking at is a 2015 Mustang Ecoboost Premium (has all the nice leather and touch screen) that costs $16,500 and it has 43,000 miles on it. The other car is a 2017 Subaru WRX (premium) that costs $18,900 with 53,000 miles on it.

My car is a 2002 Toyota Solara with 197,000 miles on it. It’s not in horrible condition, but I think it’s time for an upgrade.

I am thinking about getting a loan for the rest of the money, which I can pay off as I have a job where I’ve worked for 3 years now. I can make the payments for the car and insurance per month which would round to roughly $860 a month where I am paid $1600 a month. I live at home so no rent or utilities all I pay for is insurance, phone, gas, food, and whatever else comes up.

&lt;p&gt;This week and last week, every dawn survey has been cancelled the night before. This is essentially halving the hours I can log, thus halving my income. Are there any grounds for me to claim those hours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is making 10 hour working days 5 hours...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be so bothered if I could stay at home, and occupy myself with the extra time. But I am stuck in a hotel and can&amp;#39;t do anything. The wifi and phone signal is terrible, I can&amp;#39;t even watch a youtube video.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Looking for advice

I'll try and keep this short. Here's a quick run down.

Background:
-23y/o graduated school May '19 
-Live at home with parents for now rent-free
-Work full time at a Fortune 100 company.
-$53,476.8 salary before tax. 
-9% of pre-tax salary goes to 401(k) 
-Takehome pay is about $37,128.54 annually ($1,428.09 every 2 weeks)
-Looking to buy a house within 12 months 

Expenses: 
Car (currently waiting for it to sell as I feel this is my first step)
-$401/month for 66 more months 

-Insurance - $276/month (have a 2nd car to drive to/from work that I will keep once the car with a note sells) - so insurance should drop as well. I'm thinking to about $120 or so. 

-Fuel: roughly $200-$225 a month give or take. 32mi each way to work. Nothing to really do about that 

-Student Loans: $307.77/month for 9 more years :(

-Credit Card Debt: 
2,078.17 - working on paying down. I am almost there. 

Savings: I'd like to save $1,000 a month while I can, but I'm being told I'm trying to oversave. Currently I am only saving $400 a month. Which I feel is not enough. What happens when you run into an emergency for 2k or so, that sets you back by 3 months. (This is all aside from retirement contributions).

When I sell my car, that will put a little over 5k into my savings from equity. I do not plan to pay my CC debt with that. I will keep paying from my checks. Out of sight out of mind. 

My other car has 127k miles and seems to be a great reliable car that could last many more years, but it's always a gamble. Worth roughly $7000-$7500. I own it. 

My question is, when I sell my first car, should I liquidate the 2nd car as well? With plans to replace it with something with lower mileage/newer? 

If I liquidated both vehicles, that'd put about 12k in my savings. 

But then I will need to replace it with another car. 

If this is the case, should I get a loan for something that has my payments no more than 300? I'm unsure whether to use that 12k to keep saving for when I move out or if I should use some of it for the newer car. 

The only issue with keeping the 2nd car, is it will eventually need to be replaced, just like any car, and I'd imagine that is when I'll have a mortgage in my name. 

I'm just trying to figure out my best path forward so I don't screw myself later on because once I move out, I feel as if I am not going to have a whole lot of money left over for myself or for savings - which I can't seem to stop thinking about. 

What is a recommended amount to save as well?

,personalfinance,"Hi all, 

In late December I became desperate to try to find a way to get out of cc debt. I was making just enough to float my bills and one cc i let become delinquent because medical things came up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started searching online for solutions some sort of relief and I found ClearOne Advantage a debt ""relief"" program. They promised the moon and paying only 50% of what i owe on average and will be out of debt twice as fast. 

Naturally i did some research but was under too much pressure to REALLY dive deep, I signed up. I'm now five months in they have three of my creditors agreed to structured settlements. 

I just feel lost and I also feel like doing this i'm completely fucked in credit for the next seven years. 

Is there something else i can do? At this point i'm now 5 months late on my other creditors that haven't gone to settlement and owe for lack of an exact number greater than 10k but less 15k. 

Should i back out of the program? What should i do?

,personalfinance,"  Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this. If not please let me know. 

I was meant to start graduate school abroad this fall. That isn’t looking likely – however, I might be able to start in the spring (January). Currently my lease expires July 31. I could renew, but my apartment complex only does 12-month leases. I could renew my lease, but if I leave for the spring semester (January – May or June), then I would have to sublet my apartment. I don’t really have another choice – I couldn’t break the lease, and the apartment has already made it clear they won’t do month by month or a 6-month lease. I can’t afford any of the apartments with shorter leases in my city because shorter lease = more expensive rent. I can’t move back in with my family because my parents are deceased and my sister simply doesn’t have the room for me to be able to live with her. 

Is renewing my lease and banking on being able to sublet for the spring the right thing to do financially? Do I have any other options I’m not aware of? For reference, it’s a college town and if I stay here, I am guaranteed a job (will just continue with the one I have until I leave). I don’t know how coronavirus will affect this, but it’s generally pretty easy to find someone to sublet an apartment. There’s also the issue of – what if I renew my lease and it turns out I will be able to go abroad this fall? That’s extremely unlikely, I know, but if that happens I’d end up having to find someone to either take over my lease entirely or sublet from me for the whole year.

* Savings (Ally HYSA): $29k 
* Roth 401k: $21k
* Roth IRA: $12k

My most significant fixed costs are $830/month rent, $80/month for health insurance, $40/month to charity, and $35/month for cell/data service. Unfortunately, my new job doesn't provide any 401k match until after my first year, then they will match up to 6%. I've been putting in 10% of my paycheck anyway since I started about a month ago. My current plan is to put $750 from each paycheck into savings, which totals to $18k/year. I realize that I could max out my Roth IRA and/or contribute more to my 401k if I put less into my savings for graduate school. 

I plan on applying to master's of public health (MPH) next year, which means I would enroll in the Fall of 2022. The full tuition (not including any potential financial aid) of the MPH programs that I am looking at range from $35k to $70k. The MPH will take me out of the workforce for 1-2 years, depending on the program. I've basically hit the ceiling of what I can make in my field without an advanced degree. 

Here's my question: how should I prioritize contributing to my retirement savings vs. saving for graduate school? Here are some of my concerns:

* The power of compound interest has been pounded into me, so I know that contributing to my retirement in my 20s is important. However, I hate the idea of substantial debt and I worry that the interest rates that I would need to pay on potential loans would outweigh the interest earned on my retirement savings during the same period. 
* Would having a substantial sum in my savings account ($50-60k) when applying to grad school hurt my chances of receiving need-based aid? It would be frustrating to be penalized for saving.

The full tuition (not including any potential financial aid) of the MPH programs that I am looking at range from $35k to $70k. The MPH will take me out of the workforce for 1-2 years, depending on the program. I&amp;#39;ve basically hit the ceiling of what I can make in my field without an advanced degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my question: how should I prioritize contributing to my retirement savings vs. saving for graduate school? Here are some of my concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of compound interest has been pounded into me, so I know that contributing to my retirement in my 20s is important. However, I hate the idea of substantial debt and I worry that the interest rates that I would need to pay on potential loans would outweigh the interest earned on my retirement savings during the same period. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would having a substantial sum in my savings account ($50-60k) when applying to grad school hurt my chances of receiving need-based aid? It would be frustrating to be penalized for saving. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

I told my parents the other day that the house I’m buying is a house that I found myself on Redfin and that I asked the realtor I was working with to schedule a showing for me - the past couple months that’s how it has been. My realtor sends me places through MLS and if I like a place, he’ll schedule or if I find a place on Zillow or Redfin then I’ll ask him to schedule a showing. So basically, my parents are saying since I found the place on Redfin myself and my realtor is there to just represent me that I should ask him to pay my inspection &amp; attorney fees. Furthermore, they went on to say that when they bought their home that my mom found our home while it was having an open house on her own while she was driving in the neighborhood and at that time she didn’t have a realtor so she put in an offer, got accepted but didn’t have someone to represent her so she called a realtor and the realtor told her that he would cover the inspection &amp; attorney costs. (This was in 2001) 

I see where they’re coming from but I’m kind of hesitant to ask my realtor because during this day and age, I think it’s pretty standard for home buyers to find places they like on Zillow/Redfin on their own and view them in addition to viewing places the realtor sends through MLS. I love my realtor, he has been extremely helpful and informative throughout the whole process and been representing me very well, I feel which is another reason why I’m hesitant to ask. That being said, I read somewhere that some people use a buyers agent that will refund the buyer a part of their commission. Knowing that information, I don’t think it would hurt to ask my realtor but I don’t want to offend him (of course I’ll ask in a way where it’s not offensive, if I do).

,personalfinance,"I would like to hear your thoughts on my sailboat ownership situation. There may be no issue here, but I think I need some input anyway.
Just over a year ago I bought a 1988 41' sailboat that is my primary residence. I found a rather unique boat that had been both exceptionally cared for and received huge upgrades in the past 5 years. It was listed at twice the price of the other identical model year boats. I worked the seller down to a price about 60% above all of the other identical boats, and then had it surveyed. 
The surveyor gave it flying colors, he was very impressed. He valued the boat right at the price I had agreed to pay, and explained he had to find different boats to use as comps because this boat was in wildly better shape than the sister boats and had massive recent upgrades.
So I bought the boat and have loved every second I've owned it since. My girlfriend and I have taken it everywhere and continued to put in the hours to maintain it to perfection. 

The reason I post here, is while I can justify the boat and its value in my head, I seem to live with the constant stress that if I need to sell the boat in 2 or 3 years to have kids, will the next surveyor just value it at the other sister boats average sale price, 
 making me the fool for buying at a premium? 

I know its an open ended question, but it stresses me out every time I see another boat go on the market for half the price (albeit in poorer condition by far).

Some financial details if it helps:
- I paid 10% down.
- 3 years from now I will owe about what the poor condition boats are selling for, so I imagine I wouldn't owe cash upon sale no matter what (hopefully).",t2_zv9h6,False,,0,False,Feeling uneasy about my sailboat mortgage,[],r/personalfinance,False,6,Unset,0,False,t3_gj10cj,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Other,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589411867.0,text,6,,,text,self.personalfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear your thoughts on my sailboat ownership situation.

,personalfinance,"Hello everyone,

I think this situation is common for many people lately: In these days I am considering starting a general investment plan with an eventual accumulation plan on [Moneyfarm](https://www.moneyfarm.com/uk/). Ideal plan: start with a deposit of 10-15k (maybe in separate installments over 3-5 months to diversify more) and leave it alone for 15-25 years (when I'll be 40-50 years old). At the same time, I am considering to invest on my own on Degiro or Directa (for Italy). I made a quick calculation, not counting the ETFs that have no fees. Considering my starting budget of 10-15k, the fee costs would be around 35-66€ for the inital buy of 7 ETFs. Each subsequent year, I would like to add a budget of 2.4k as part of the accumulation plan, so my annual fees should then amount to 20-66€ + ETFs costs for 7-14 entries per year (1-2 entries per year for 7 ETFs).  MoneyFarm (1% per year on capital + ETF costs, so 1.28%). Of course this calculation is not considering the ETFs that you can buy without fees, which would drastically make my DIY option a lot cheaper, but I made the calculation anyway since I don't know which ETFs are best for my situation.

Looking at JustETF, I realized that I don't have the basis for making a precise and safe asset allocation. I'm not a beginner in finance/economy and I know a few things, but as I said I don't feel ready. On paper I know how to diversify and other principles, but then when it comes to the concrete knowledge I simply which specific ETFs I could use to build my portfolio. The only thing that I know is I want accumulative type ETFs and I want them to be ""reliable"".

So I was wondering, how long does it take to learn how to correctly build a serious portfolio? Moneyfarm seems like a reliable option that builds a portfolio with professional and well-kept criteria, and chooses the right financial instruments. Considering this comparison, how long would it take for me to do a job like theirs on my own? We are talking about savings that I would like to grow over time and not squander through poor choices. Lastly, where can I cultivate my knowledge about ETFs? Also, should I consider a pension fund instead of this..?

,personalfinance,"Hello pf! LTLFTP, yadda yadda yadda...

I'm finally in a position where I can start to really focus on eliminating my (and my wife's) old credit card debt. Everything I'm reading focuses on snowball vs. avalanche methods and while I agree avalanche is better than snowball financially, I started thinking.

If the goal of all of this is to pay the least amount of interest, what if I take the monthly approach of throwing my extra money towards the CC that charges me the most interest in **that month**?

For example: Let's say I have $1000 above and beyond minimum payments to allocate to debt. 



Card | Balance | Rate | Monthly Interest
---|---|----|----|----
A | $8000 | 16.99% | $113.27
B | $9000 | 13.99% | $104.93 
C | $3900 | 26.99% | $87.72 
D | $4000 | 22.99% | $76.63 
E | $4750 | 15.24% | $60.33 
F | $2600 | 24.99% | $54.15 
G | $900 | 8.90% | $6.68 


Snowball would dictate I pay down to completion in this order: G, F, C, D, E, A, B

Avalanche dictates I would pay down to completion in this order: C, F, D, A, E, B, G

But what if instead you pay down by whichever account has the highest interest charge for that particular month? In the above table I would start with my $1000 applied to A. Then next month after paying down A it reaches the point where Card B has the higher interest charge for that month, so I apply my extra $1000 to that one, and so on until all accounts are paid off. So the target of $1k application changes month to month.

Does such a method exist, is it any more financially (forget morale) advantaged over avalanche, is there an online calculator so I can see how much better (or worse) this method is vs the others? I've been all over the place but unfortunately avalanche and snowball are so dominant/prominent that I can't find anything other than those two. I can breakdown this method very manually in a spreadsheet to get my answers but it's going to take a while because I'm not 100% sure how to do it easily in Excel and I don't want to [spend more time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [developing](https://xkcd.com/1319/) the calculator than [doing the manual calculation](https://xkcd.com/1445/). So I'm leaning on the hive mind of Reddit to seek the enlightenment I desire.

Thanks all!

P.S. Yes, I know that's a lot of credit cards. Some were my wife's before we were together, some are mine, and we also have one we opened jointly. It's not relevant as to how/why they got this high, but I've been **trying** to pay these down for a long time and it seems I'm finally at a point I am able and I'll just leave it at that.

**EDIT**: Now with 100% more math! Okay, so numbers don't lie. Avalanche continues to be the numbers king. But it never hurts to ask the questions or we'll never find anyway to do things better.

For those curious (using my actual numbers) over the course of 12 months (because soon after accounts began getting to 0 balances and the calculations became slightly more complex) my proposed method paid out a total of $4919.65 in interest vs. Avalanche paid out $4367.63.

I remember having a long conversation with my father saying ""I hope the economy doesn't collapse between now and then"".  We put down $2500 and paid an additional $850 for inspections, so we are in it for $3350 and our realtor said we could walk away at any point if we are willing to lose our earnest money.

We have been living in a 1400 sqft home for 5 years that we have outgrown since our kiddo was born.

Our prospective new home is priced at $344k, and we have 20% down (\~$66k), and were planning on using equity from current home and doing a recast after our current home sells, meaning we would have an additional $80-90k \[ideally\] to put towards principal (approximately 42% down).

I’m trying to clean up my credit and my first step was to pull my credit. There’s several things on it that I want to validate prior to working through them.

I rent an apartment in NYC, have been with this management company for 3 years, and in this unit for 2. I have always paid my rent on time, if not early, and my credit score has just recently crossed into the excellent range, which feels good. My lease is up June 1, and I received my renewal end of March, you know, right when a certain virus hit New York kind of hard. Thankfully, due to my career being a pretty in-demand profession and essential work (I'm a veterinarian and people love their pets), I am still working and don't have any real fear of job loss or insecurity. However, my annual raise will likely be minimal, if it will happen at all, so my wages will likely be stagnant, which I'm sure is the case for many workers right now fortunate enough to still be employed. Nevertheless, the management company proposed a rent increase of about $100 a month, which, in a normal year would be annoying but tolerable with increased wages, and would correspond with inflation I suppose. But this is not a normal year. I have tried to reach out to the management company about 6 times at this point to re-think this rent increase and have been met with absolute silence - my emails and calls go unanswered, and when I reached out to the leasing office, all they did was send me right back to the renting office who have failed to answer me. When I asked the leasing office for a different email address because that one is not answering me, they also stopped answering my emails.

At this point I feel stuck and a little nervous. I don't want to have no lease and be at risk of eviction, but I also know I am an excellent tenant and don't want to be strong armed into paying what isn't really fair given the drastically changed economic landscape of the city, and the world.

,personalfinance,"Hi all. I searched and found a few relevant threads, but I am still a bit confused on if this should matter at this point in my life. I have several retirement accounts. The IRA and Solo 401(K) are Roth; the account through work (essentially a 401(K)) is not. 

Previous posts indicate that you'd want to put the stuff projected to grow more (i.e. stocks) in Roth and stuff projected to grow less (i.e. bonds) in traditional. I guess I'm still a bit confused on whether the allocation across the accounts actually matters in the here-and-now. Since all accounts are growing tax-free and I can freely rebalance across them before the Traditional gets taxed on withdrawal, I feel like I should be allocating them by choosing the few things in my Traditional work 401(K) that have low expense ratios and then making up the rest of the allocation in my Roth.

The IRA and Solo 401(K) are Roth; the account through work (essentially a 401(K)) is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous posts indicate that you&amp;#39;d want to put the stuff projected to grow more (i.e. stocks) in Roth and stuff projected to grow less (i.e. bonds) in traditional. I guess I&amp;#39;m still a bit confused on whether the allocation across the accounts actually matters in the here-and-now. Since all accounts are growing tax-free and I can freely rebalance across them before the Traditional gets taxed on withdrawal, I feel like I should be allocating them by choosing the few things in my Traditional work 401(K) that have low expense ratios and then making up the rest of the allocation in my Roth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious what I am missing here, since it feels like I am missing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Thanks for any insight!&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"So I’m in a bit of a situation. I’m 24 years old and I just relocated on a $7,000 relocation package with my current company about two months ago which states I have to be in the role for two years, and that it’s prorated on a daily basis so I would end up owing around $6k still if I left this month. The job I have now is not what I expected, but I’m managing. I’m out here in the new town completely alone, which has taken a toll on my mental health. Again, I’m managing, but I feel like I’m just trying to keep my head above water. I’ve been with this company for almost four years, worked my way up into a management role and went from making about 25k to 66k a year and have a decent amount of stocks. I feel like I owe them, for helping me get this far, so I have a lot of guilt over leaving. 

The new company wants to offer me a $4.5k relocation package to move back to my home town, as well as $5.5k in stocks every year and a $10.8-13.9k annual bonus. My base salary would be $68k but my total compensation would be $89k, while my current role is only $74k. The new job is within the same line of business (customer fulfillment) however, I would be doing QA management and have a significantly smaller team and more ability to work on my own personal growth. This week, I also get about $5k in stocks from my current company that I could use to offset the relo I’m going to have to pay back. I don’t have much in savings, about $7k because I still have student loans and minor CC debt, but that is also an option. 

Ultimately, with my current company I thought transitioning into a new role would help me feel a little less burnt out, yet I still do. My current company is huge, and gets a lot of bad media, so the culture has gotten very bad in many areas. 

Not exactly sure what the best move is - I think I would be much happier in a QA role and moving back to be near my family and friends but it comes at a price. I also am extremely scared to tell my current manager about the new job (if I take it) because I’m afraid it looks so bad that I came here for only two months before leaving. But what I’m doing now is not something I’m passionate about. Since this has been my only long term job, I’m hesitant to make this decision quickly, but I have to let the other company know my decision soon. Can anyone give me some guidance?

Obviously $4000 is nothing compared to the potential results of this situation, and considering all of the facts it seems like at the end of it all I will walk away with way more than I am spending. However, I don&amp;#39;t have $4000, and the payment plan offered by the lawyer really maxes out my budget. Essentially all of my money that isn&amp;#39;t going to rent or bills will go to this for the next four months. In theory, it could go beyond the 10 hours of work that I would pay him for, and I could also in theory continue to pay him, however I don&amp;#39;t really have an emergency fund that I can tap into if something goes awry in any other parts of my life (got dicked on taxes, which screwed up my e-fund).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do? Do I proceed and pay him?&lt;/p&gt;

All we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5K, so we’d break even within the first year.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking into maybe  FZROX or FSKAX for a single fund or FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX with a 60/30/10 split for a 3-fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&amp;#39;ve done a bunch of research and I still don&amp;#39;t understand half the things I&amp;#39;m reading so any advice would be much appreciated! 
Thank you so much in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

i’d like to improve my credit score. currently my credit utilization ratio is around 70%. ive been aggressively paying off debt the last two months and foresee having 0 debt by August. 

i would like to implement an additional measure to reduce my ratio by adding a fifth line of credit with a credit card. i currently have four total lines of credit. my first question is if i get a new credit card, will that help increase my credit? i have had zero missed payments in seven years across all accounts, but have essentially maintained a very high or maxed out revolving line of credit for about three of those seven years. the last time i asked to increase my credit on my discover card, which was about a year ago, it was denied.

Starting this year, I am on track to contribute $19,500 to a Traditional 403-B and $6,000 to a Roth IRA.

(all figures are in Australian, bear in mind cost of living is higher in Aus than US)

* Single child, 2 adult family, currently single income of $80k (clear about $5100/month). Child is very early school, parents are late 40s (we started late)
* Owe $415k on $750k house
* Owe $25k on 2 credit cards
* Second smaller income will begin within 6 months probably.
* Zero savings.
* Within the next few months I expect to get about $300k inheritance which I believe is totally tax free in Australia.

What I know about finance: 

pay off your debts!!! Obvs the credit cards have gotta go immediately. (These are left over from a small business, normally we don't have credit cards at all)

Next would be to pay off mortgage as much as possible.

What I would like to know however, is what kind of options might be good for using the equity we would then have in the house to try to build some wealth over the next 5-10 years.

We'd like to upgrade our house situation, but I understand moving to a bigger/nicer place is then going to put our mortgage back up higher, just for more ""niceness"".

,personalfinance,"Need to use a throwaway account for this.

My dad passed away over 3 weeks ago. He was self employed, and had no health or life insurance. Hospital bills are pouring in, upwards of $40k (so far.) He left behind about $50k in credit card debt and my mom charged the funeral ($10k) to a card as well. They own a home with $9k left on the mortgage and it’s worth about $180k. My dad worked his entire life, literally up until the day he died; I don’t want his debtors taking the home he worked so hard for. 

We’ve started claims with the credit card companies, still waiting to hear back from them. My mom was an authorized user on all of them.

We have spoken to the hospitals about bill reduction. One of the things they want is either the last tax return, or a letter from the IRS, claiming no taxes filed. Here’s the kicker...

My dad never filed any taxes. Ever. We moved to the US in 1990 from England. 30 years of working under the table. I don’t know how this happened, or how he got away with it. Most likely it’s because he never made much money. Enough to pay the bills, put me through college, and travel to Ireland/England a couple times a year to visit family. His work (house painter) really slowed down over the last few years, thus the massive credit card debt. 

I’m in a little over my head now. My aunt is helping by reaching out to lawyers and accountants. The accountant worries that if we request these non-filer documents, we could be opening a can of worms with the IRS. But he also said the probate process might open them up anyway. 

My mom is super worried she is going to lose the house. We would like to be able to sell it so she has money to pay off the credit cards and have some money to be able to live off of (most likely with me.)

I recently started my career as a nurse and the hospital that I’m working at offers different health insurance plans. However, I’m not very knowledgeable about much regarding finances/insurance since I have very recently just started “adulting” so I was wondering if I could get some insight.

I need to set up my health insurance plan but am unsure of which one to choose. One of the insurance plans offered is an HSA medical plan, but I don’t quite know what that is. 

Can someone please explain what it is to me in the simplest way possible, and what the benefits of having an HSA would be?

I am a 22 year old college student. I initially opened my Roth IRA with Vanguard in September of 2019, and contributed $3000. After a few months with them, I decided to transfer my Roth IRA to M1 Finance, as I didn't enjoy the interface with Vanguard. I thought I liked the M1 Finance interface, as I was using them for my individual brokerage account for a few weeks prior to transferring. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that M1 Finance was not the broker I wanted to hold my Roth IRA with. I was trying to transfer my Roth IRA from M1 to Charles Schwab, but M1 was giving me a big headache and not a clear answer. This eventually lead me to liquidating my account, and transferring the money into my bank. I am now with Charles Schwab and have contributed another $3000 for the 2019 year. From my understanding, since I took out the money from my M1 Finance account, I cannot contribute another $3000 to the 2019 year. Is this correct?

September of 2018 I got my first car from a dealer (and thus first car payment). I had pretty crappy credit as I was going through nursing school and supporting myself at the age of 18.

,personalfinance,"I am 23 and entering my final year of college. After I graduate, I am going to move to California. I’m not sure where, it will depend where I can land a job. I know that location makes a huge difference when it comes to financial planning, but I am sure you all still have some helpful input. 

I will be graduating with a degree in Biology. I am eventually going to Medical School, but I want to take some time off to pay down my student loans and to get my feet on the ground. In the meantime, I hope to get a job doing medical device sales, or something of that nature.

I currently have 40k in student loan debt. I am already working on paying it back while I am still in school so I can get ahead. By the time I graduate, I will probably have paid it down to 30k, maybe even less. (I have a full time job, and I have a side hustle in which the money goes directly to my loans).

I know it may seem irresponsible to move somewhere so expensive while I have such a high amount of debt (I currently live in Arkansas where the cost of living is much lower) but it has been a dream of mine to live in California for as long as I can remember. I want to do it while I’m young and free with few responsibilities.

Of course, I wouldn’t move there until I got a job. But I still need money prior to moving. I would greatly appreciate financial planning advice for this move. My focus is my debt right now, but how much should I be putting aside for next year?

After I graduate, I am going to move to California. I’m not sure where, it will depend where I can land a job. I know that location makes a huge difference when it comes to financial planning, but I am sure you all still have some helpful input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be graduating with a degree in Biology. I am eventually going to Medical School, but I want to take some time off to pay down my student loans and to get my feet on the ground. In the meantime, I hope to get a job doing medical device sales, or something of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have 40k in student loan debt. I am already working on paying it back while I am still in school so I can get ahead. By the time I graduate, I will probably have paid it down to 30k, maybe even less. (I have a full time job, and I have a side hustle in which the money goes directly to my loans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it may seem irresponsible to move somewhere so expensive while I have such a high amount of debt (I currently live in Arkansas where the cost of living is much lower) but it has been a dream of mine to live in California for as long as I can remember. I want to do it while I’m young and free with few responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t move there until I got a job. But I still need money prior to moving. I would greatly appreciate financial planning advice for this move. My focus is my debt right now, but how much should I be putting aside for next year? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also just appreciate any of your own experiences or advice! &lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"I work as a teacher and my wife works as a nurse. We have stable careers and a combined take home of around 150k.

We had an opportunity at age 24 (her 25) to buy a home, so we spent the money we saved for a wedding on the downpayment and remodel of our home. We were a bit over our heads with it, not financially, but more in terms of being homeowners. It was a great deal on the smallest house in an amazing neighborhood that has doubled in value since we bought it.

However, because of the amount of remodeling we had to do to it, we've just spent a lot of money on short term 0% loans to cover things like appliances, floors, and other remodeling things.

Now, four years later, we are in a position where our budget is very stable after several years of salary growth with very little debt. I'm looking to refinance my home and start saving for retirement, while not affecting our short terms saving goals (as we still need around 60k in remodeling to ""finish"" the house entirely).

29 has kind of snuck up on me, and I know I should've invested earlier than now, but I want to get started.

1. Refinancing my home.

My current home loan was originally 198k at 4.25% fixed, and the current principal is at 182. I talked to quicken loans and their offer estimate for a 15 year was 2.875% but they are looking to add 12k to my note in closing costs. 5400 for an escrow account and 6600 for their closing fees and whatever points they are paying down, which is unclear to me as of yet. It feels like I shouldn't need escrow and the closing costs seem very high as well. I should definitely shop around for this, right? 


I'm not sure I want to throw 12k paying those up front, but at the same time the escrow account from my current mortgage should cover the 5400 for the new escrow (I did check the balance), but that still leaves their 6600 fees. The paperwork estimate he sent was for the 30 year (I was exploring both options) and says 2pts paid down and 1600 in fees, with an interest rate on the 30 year of 3.375. Seems like I should have a better interest rate than that at this point. The original loan was with 10% down, a much higher debt to incom ratio, much worse credit, and much worse rates at the time (Feb 2016). Now we both have 800+ credit scores and they are offering me 3.875 as my interest rate before I pay it down? That seems like I'm being ripped off, but again I know nothing.

2. Setting up my retirement.

My dad says RothIRA. I think my wife and I are pretty capped at our current levels of income. She won't be making much more in her current position, I probably won't be breaking 70k any time soon. Is a RothIRA the right choice for us? 

Should I dump the 6k max for the year in right now for both of us, while the market is at a low, or stick to 1000$ a month this year and go to 500$ a month next year? Does that even matter? 

Are there any better investment options for my situation?


The only other debt we have currently is our car payment of 400 a month.

Currently I rent, which is $700 a month and includes all utilities. I have no debt whatsoever and my car is fully paid off.

Right now I'm looking at buying my first house which is proving to be rather intimidating. I have $10,000 saved up at the moment and the houses i'm looking at are in the $75,000 to $85,000 range. My credit score is 781 so I don't think getting a loan would be a problem. 

Anyway, for what I pay in rent, it would be cheaper on a month to month basis to own a home. On top of that, I would be moving to a 3 bedroom home up from a studio which would be a huge quality of life improvement. That and not having to hear noisy neighbors all the time.

Does now seem like a good time to buy? Or should I wait until I save more/make more?

- 25 years old, 85k salary (and increasing), California

- I have a 150k down payment

- Looking to buy a ~700k-750k house 

With my down payment, a house in the 700-750k range is 22% down payment. 

Zillow says houses at these prices with that down payment come down to $3,300-$3,500 a month. After taxes, retirement, etc, my paycheck comes out to about $4,500 a month.

I plan to rent out a room in my house when I move in to help with extra income. Let's say I rent a room in the house to someone for $1,700 a month.

Would a mortgage lender give me the extra $550,000 after my down payment to buy that house knowing I will be renting out a room? Is there a special rule or different type of application I have to fill out for renting?

,personalfinance,"I was hospitalized for a week in September of 2018. Over the coming months after getting out of the hospital, I received numerous bills/letters/etc from my insurance company/the hospital and I paid everything immediately. Considering the cost of healthcare in the US,  these amounts were way higher than my out of pocket maximum pocket maximum, so I ended up paying that much (I believe it was $3500) and all my deductibles, etc. I had some more procedures in November and December, and they were all covered 100% because I had hit that out of pocket maximum.

Fast forward 20 months and I just received a bill for $303.20 from the hospital for my hospitalization in 2018. The bill isn't like any other bill I've gotten from them, because the “adjustments”, “patient payments”, and “amount due” columns are all blank all the way down the bill, and then the last line item is “adjustments and payments” which reads:
Adjustments: -$4362.80
Patient payments: -$200.00
Charges: - $4866.00
Amount due: $303.20

I called the hospital and they said that this bill was generated because my insurance company (blue cross blue shield) had just reprocessed the bill on 05/02/20 and adjusted what they were paying, so I was responsible for the difference that that's why I got the bill.

I already paid my out of pocket maximum in 2018, so how can I be billed more for services that occurred in 2018? If the insurance company is denying to pay the full amount for specific line items, why are the line items “adjustments”, “patient payments”, and “amount due” all blank? I've read online that it isn't uncommon for someone to get a bill a year or so later than a hospitalization, but this is almost two years, which I find completely absurd. I know that debts can still be collected for years (5 years?) but from what I understand this isn't an old debt I owe, it's a new debt due to the hospital or insurance company changing what was paid, which just seems so fishy to me. Like as if I sold you a car 20 months ago and now today I'm changing the price, if that makes sense.

Do I have any recourse in fighting this, or am I just stuck paying out? I've been furloughed at work with no timeline for coming back, so every penny counts right now. I already tried to talk to the hospital about it, and they only help their financial department offered was to set me up with a 12 month payment plan. 

Any advice for how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated!


UPDATE:

Unfortunately I don't have much to update, and I really haven't gotten anywhere with this after 6 hours on the phone with them. I contacted the hospital and they said this bill was generated because Blue Cross denied or updated a claim. I called Blue Cross and they said that wasn't true and they had no idea what the hospital was talking about, and that they have this claim marked as paid and closed on February of 2019. After calling each of them half a dozen times, each one saying the other is either lying or doesn't know what they're talking about, I called them both on a conference call and sat on mute for over two hours while they discussed the bill. None of it made much sense to me and they didn't even seem to know how to talk to each other - The hospital would say ""here is the claim number XXXXXXXX"" and the insurance would say ""That's not a claim number, we don't use letters in our claim numbers, what are you talking about"" and on and on. At this point they have now sent me an itemized bill, but it doesn't have specific line items adding up to the total they claim I owe. They are saying that these charges technically occurred before the date that I hit my OOP maximum, and I argued that if that was the case, shouldn't I be refunded for any payments I made after that date, because as it stands now this payment will put my out of pocket over the maximum. That didn't get me anywhere and they said I should call my bank for all statements from 2018 to verify whether I truly paid my OOP maximum or whether I still owe $303.20 in order to hit that maximum. Blue Cross is physically mailing me an updated EOB and itemized list that they say will clarify all of this, but I don't think it will. I was also told that because this bill is from 20 months ago it is too late to file an appeal or dispute the charges, but I think that's just a lie to keep me from trying to pursue that option. All in all, I'm out 6 hours of phone calls today alone, and I feel like I'm still on the hook for this complete BS bill.

,personalfinance,"Hi guys,

So I've tried a couple companies already in my area , to try and get a general idea of closing costs  / total savings when it comes to refinancing from my current 3.8% (or so) loan to try and get down to about 2.75%.

At first, they got back to me when it was concerning doing 20-30 year loans, but after telling them I'm trying to get down to a 10 year loan to save as much in interest in payments (at the cost of paying higher monthly payments), both of those companies seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth.

Are there certain reputable companies out there to seek when refinancing, or do you guys just search Yelp / Google in hopes of finding a good one? I just don't want to have to put in applications with several companies in the opes of finding the best deal.

I'm using a mortgage calculator and have a close idea of where my goal is in terms of refinancing / closing costs/ savings, but once I ask questions like ""Why is it this calculator, using the same figures, shows I should be saving more than what you're telling me I should save?"" question comes up, that seems to be ending the conversation.

&lt;p&gt;At first, they got back to me when it was concerning doing 20-30 year loans, but after telling them I&amp;#39;m trying to get down to a 10 year loan to save as much in interest in payments (at the cost of paying higher monthly payments), both of those companies seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there certain reputable companies out there to seek when refinancing, or do you guys just search Yelp / Google in hopes of finding a good one? I just don&amp;#39;t want to have to put in applications with several companies in the opes of finding the best deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using a mortgage calculator and have a close idea of where my goal is in terms of refinancing / closing costs/ savings, but once I ask questions like &amp;quot;Why is it this calculator, using the same figures, shows I should be saving more than what you&amp;#39;re telling me I should save?&amp;quot; question comes up, that seems to be ending the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newbie hoping to find help here. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Disclaimer- I am not giving advice to you. It is about me talking to myself. If you could help me out by telling me how naive I am and where the plan is wrong and not practical so that I could improve my future self. I NEED YOUR ADVICE.  

 The first time I read this book was when I was in 9th grade. I have never fully understood the concepts presented in this book until I encountered those concepts myself through different life experiences. Obviously, this book is a start. I try to keep it simple. These concepts just keep you on the right path, but how you get there is up to you. Walk, run, fly, crawl. Just finish it. Remember “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.” Having the right mindset is critical. Making money is the next step, but this book does not show how to. It does but vaguely. Well, you need somewhere to start, and this book is a great place to do so. Let's get into it. Robert has two dads. One is poor and the other one is rich. He boiled lessons he learned from two dads down into 6 lessons.

The first lesson is that the rich do not work the money. One quote that got me pondered for so many years when I first read it. “The Poor work for money, while the Rich have the money work for them” What did Robert mean when he said the rich have money work for them? Is it that the rich have some magic turn money into some kind of bus boy and boss them around all day long?. If so, sign me up. I finally understood this concept when I was introduced to stock. Stock is not a piece of paper. There is a business behind it. If I can not optimize my money, let somebody use it and return me with principal plus interest. All I do is have a good night's sleep.

I remembered one of my friends told me that he invested his money in his personal car. He had all the accessories and top of the line car. I laughed at it because I believe a car can never hold its value unless he buys the car, fixes it and sells it for profit. To me, a car is just a tool getting me from point A to point B. That is why it is important to understand the second lesson: the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets are what puts money into your pocket and liabilities are what takes money out of your pocket. Assets are houses, stocks and businesses. What makes you money, not take money away from you.

The third lesson is mind your own business. I prefer to call it that profits are better than wages. You either work for a company, government or the bank. You need to have financial independence. What I mean by financial independence is that you are able to live from your own resources. Thinking about getting fire from your job the next morning. The fourth lesson is taxes. Both rich and poor are trying to earn money. The difference is that the rich spend their earnings before they pay taxes and the poor do the opposite. How do the rich do that?. You have to learn the power of corporations and accounting. This gets me to the fifth lesson: the rich invent money.

The fifth chapter is more like when I close my eyes, I can't see. It divides into 4 subsections- accounting, invest, market and laws. Accounting, you have to understand the numbers so that you could spend your hard earned money before the Fed has their hands on it. This explanation is more abstract and technical. The better way to explain it is to use accounting to keep track of your spending. Otherwise, it is like you eat and have diarrhea at the same time. You need imodium man. The best way to do it is to spend your money with cash instead of a credit card. Next, investing means keep your cash flow. This could be through bonds, stock and real estate. Stocks are easy. If you are an average investor, VOO fund is the way to go. Why? Check out your probability of beating the market. Real estate remembers one rule- Value added or Turning trash into gold. Find a house that needs to be fixed. Buy it, fix it and sell it. For every dollar you put in, you could get 4$ back. Market is full of opportunities. It is all about supply and demand. You gotta keep your eyes open and pay careful attention to what the market demands. These opportunities for you to innovate and fulfill the needs of the market. Golden rule- Ignorance of law is not an excuse for any crimes that you commit. Know the law, at least the basics, understand your rights and think like a lawyer. The reason I got into law is because when I play a board game with my friends, I see that whoever understands the rules of the game the most, wins the game because they are able to manipulate the game into their advantages. This applies to real life too. If watching “Making a murderer” does not make your hand stand straight up while thinking that you could be the one wasted 18 years for intentionally wrongfully convicted, think again. On the other hand, if you would like to get away with murder like O.J, law may be the first tool.

The last lesson is that learning to earn is more important than earning itself.The average student earns 11$ per hour. I earned 19$ per hour working as a Pharmacy Intern. I quit my job to participate in the PSSNY business plan competition. People say that I am stupid because this hospital pharmacy intern is hard to come by. There is a limited number of hospitals compared to chain pharmacies. If I work 20 hours per day, every week of the month, every month of the year, I could earn up to 18,240$ compared to 125$ for winning the competition that took me the whole year to prepare. Why I still pick the competition over the job, if I get to choose it all over again and never regret one bit. I learned how to be a leader and take responsibility and motivate others. I could earn much more in the future.

Theory is just a theory if you can not apply it. There are a lot of obstacles that you have to overcome. They include fear, cynicism, lazy, bad habits and arrogance. Fear is nothing but the suffering itself. Lazy is when you don't have enough reasons to thrive. Bad habit is your nature and hard to overcome unless you understand the mechanism of habit is cue-routine-reward and start to manipulate it. Cynicism is funny because if you die today doing what you love, will dying still be a problem anymore. Arrogance is simply that you need to shut up and listen. Beyond all of this, the first step is a big step. I am lazy to run every day. But I tricked myself. How about I change my clothes and drive my car to the bike trail. If I get there and I still do not change your mind, I could always drive back home and continue to do whatever I am doing at the moment. But it  has never happened that I drive back to my house after getting there. . Well if you make it to here, thank you so much. Comment below. Let me know what you think.

,personalfinance,"Something I don't quite understand: Back when the CARD act legislation was passed, why didn't they also put in provisions that would prevent credit card issuers from locking their customers into a permanent ""default"" interest rate (usually nearly 30%), rather than requiring them to drop the rate back down over time to the original rate after something like 6 or 9 months of on-time payments and ""good behavior""?

With all the positive changes that legislation produced, it seems that they missed a huge opportunity to prevent CC issuers from endlessly screwing their customers year after year by tricking them with a low rate, then as soon as they accidentally step on any ""late payment landmine"" ... BOOM! ... their default ""loan shark"" rate kicks in for the entire life of that card.

I remember missing a few payments on my Discover card around 18 or 20 years ago after which they immediately locked me into a 28.99% default rate and kept it there for all that time. They refused to lower it after repeated requests, even after almost 2 decades of perfect payments. The only option they offered was to close out my original card and open a brand new ""Discover It"" card, which meant possibly loosing my very long card history length and also paying some huge transfer fee to park my debt onto the new card. Fortunately, my high Discover balance is now $0 and has been for some time, for that very reason. They were simply too greedy when all I wanted them to do was lower my rate just a little. I finally decided to use an installment based loan to get rid of their excessively high interest payments. So rather than robbing me just a little less, they lost the whole shebang. I only keep my original Discover Card active because it is one of my oldest cards and I don't want the hits to my credit score and DTI for closing it right now. But I do wonder why the CARD act didn't simply put a stop to the filthy greedy practice of jacking up rates permanently.

We have the income to back it all up.  Our current D:I is splendid.  I mean in reality we can afford roughly $350k-$400k in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

&lt;p&gt;The problem is our credit scores.  I&amp;#39;m barely 620s (she&amp;#39;s a little less).  Doesn&amp;#39;t look like we can do much to improve our scores much really.  There was a hiccup in 2018 and went +90 on a credit card, but currently that card is $0 and we recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the income to back it all up.  Our current D:I is splendid.  I mean in reality we can afford roughly $350k-$400k in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we&amp;#39;ll go VA for the no downpayment.  But still have savings for closing costs and miscellaneous costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it going to take?  Will lenders &amp;quot;overlook&amp;quot; subpar credit with verified income and low current debt and good healthy chunk of savings?&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"TLDR: mid 20's; roughly 9.5 years of experience, non traditional career path. 125k salary currently, 375k net worth, Considering UC Davis MBA for 105k - part time. Is it worth it?

Started in accounting/bookkeeping 

Worked for client in Health Technology.  Worked at firm for 5 years, Got offers at 1 large defense contractor, 1 well known unicorn, and 1 large university. 

Wanted something more ethically rewarding so I joined public sector and became an executive within a short period. Do well with it. I'm well liked and do great work but the public sector is unlikely to yield anywhere close to the promotions I've seen in the past. I'm fast paced and don't want to get bored and I like the idea of having the options to go into other fields in the next 2-3 years. I am looking at the next 40 years of my career and thinking about what I could do at this point and without an MBA my options seem limited. I don't want an MPA, but I'm open to other graduate programs in theory, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush in this case and I'm already in the program...

I enjoy being in the public sector. The WLB and the pay at this level and at my age are good. I'm free to work on my side businesses (consulting and a real estate development) but they are really more hobbies at this point than serious investments.

Looking at UC Davis MBA - Online with the option of switching to part time. Currently work in public sector. Make 125k with great benefits and low chance of layoff amidst COVID 19.

Didn't take the GMAT, didn't really want to yet but noticed that several schools were waiving the GMAT requirement due to COVID. I figured what the heck, and applied to a few low state schools for the ""check box"" and then UC Davis because I was genuinely interested in a better program where I could keep my job while I did it. I've never had any problems academically and am confident I could do an MBA and work.

I did very well at the tech company I was at as well as some other business side dealings and have roughly 300k saved. I also have around 75k in 401k/retirement funds and my partner (28) has 100k in their savings. We live frugally and certainly don't spend all of our income but buy most of what we want. Partner is finishing first degree in December and will likely get a low starting salary out of school (50-60k) after a short break. Neither of us are looking to FIRE as we enjoy working and if we decide in the future it looks more than likely that we will be fine with doing so. We took all of our money out of the market in late February, narrowly missing the crash but not making any capital gains currently. Likely to go back in the market in equity in a few months and real estate.

I got into UC Davis for their online MBA, it costs 105k! yikes. Meanwhile other schools want applicants to take the traditional MBA again. I frankly don't much want to take the GMAT at this point for a few reasons. At the top of the list, if I took the GMAT and scored well (I have done very well on the practice tests) and got into a M7 program. I still don't think I'd go. 2 years at 125k with 3-&gt;5% raises plus my side business income 25k per year in lost income and 120k for school is a whopping $424k. I went to a low rank school for UG that doesn't impress on my resume.

,personalfinance,"Hello everyone.

I know this question has been asked a million times over (very sorry in advance), but I wanted to post in case anything has changed.

I’m a 24 year old (25 in September) about to open a Roth IRA with Schwab and have about 3k to put into it at the moment.

I know that once the money goes through into the account, I have to choose things to invest in.

I’ve heard a lot about target date funds. This seems right up my alley, as I’m looking at this account as a set and forget. I want to maximize my earnings without really having to do anything except load the money and keep buying into the same stocks.

What would be the best move(s) for me? Also, any future advice? Right now, I’m not making a ton, and am putting most of my paycheck towards my student loans, car loan, and bills, but I hope to clear the debt in the next few years, and move into higher paying jobs as well.

When I tried to find the owner of this debt it led me to calling a collections agency who said they don’t own it anymore but wouldn’t tell me who does. 

How do I pay this off/find out who owns it?? What steps should I be taking to prepare to pay it? Is there anything I shouldn’t say on the phone when I do get in contact. I can pay it in full if needed but is that required?

So my grandma had a small debt that went to collections, that she supposedly settled already, from what she tells me. She got a letter from some agency, saying if she paid a certain amount by a certain date, that the debt would be settled. She ended up sending the amount in the mail, and got the post office to stamp something for her proving she sent it on the day she did. Only problem is she sent it like 2 days late. 

Now a seemingly different firm sent her a letter recently saying they were going to take it to court. I told her it was probably because she sent it 2 days late. Anyway, I told her I wanted to help her out for mothers day and see if I could figure anything out. 

I called the number on the letter, and told this lady that I was calling for my grandma, and wanted to know why the debt isnt settled yet. She asked me my name, and I gave her my first name. Then she said that in order for her to talk about the debt with me, my grandma needed to give her permission. So i gave the phone to my grandma, she gave them the last 4 of her social, and her name. Then they asked her for my name again. I motioned to her to not give them my last name but she said it anyway by mistake (shes 80 years old, not as fast as she used to be I guess, she apologized though). Then I grabbed the phone from her and asked the lady for any information. Then she kept telling me the conversation was being recorded, and kept asking me for my social security number. Alarm bells were going off in my head. I hung up without giving her any more information of mine.

My concern is, was she trying to somehow attach me to the account, so they could go after me for the money in the event my grandma couldnt pay? The only information of mine they have is my first and last name (for all they know its fake), they do not have my address, social, dob, or anything else besides knowing im related to my grandma. I dont think I can help my grandma with this at all, she should get an attorney right? 

TLDR: Called collections agency for my grandma to try and figure out what is going on. They were shady the whole time and I hung up without learning anything useful. They have my first and last name, and nothing else. Should I be worried about them coming after me for the money? Should my grandma hire an attorney?

I currently have 2 options in mind. I could move within 20mins of work (where the cheapest nice apartments close are). Which would cost at minimum 600/month and close to 200/300 utilities. It would be 20mins from work and cut down on my gas somewhat. I'd say w that option, about 100/month in gas (I figured this from staying w a friend for a short while who lives near where I'd b moving). 

Or I could stay in the town I'm in, which is a small town. The same sized apartment would cost about 450/month and closer to 200/month in utilities. 35/40 minute drive from work. I spend about 160/month in gas. 

I'm just trying to think in the long run what would be better for me? It's only a 15 minute/60$ a month gas difference. But a 250$/month cash difference. 

And while part of me would love to be closer to work and friends, part of me would also prefer to have that money to save. I've already been driving the distance daily for almost 5 years to work and to see friends (vice versa). But I'm considering in the long run. 

I've also considered a middle third option of staying in my town for 1-2 years until my vehicle is paid off then moving closer once I have that extra change in my pocket. I'm also considering my privacy. I know being in my hometown would be nice because I'd be near some family in case of emergency, but on the other hand, that also means the possibility of more intrusions from said family. 

So, in looking for advice, what would anyone recommend? Any advice or input is greatly appreciated!

,personalfinance,"I graduated college two years ago and am on track to finish paying off my student loans next month. In doing so, I will free up a lot of money in my budget to invest.

Until the last couple of weeks, I have been investing investing up to my employer match of 6%. I have since changed this to 10% as I am trying to invest more aggressively. Out of the Fidelity funds available for me to select, I have chosen the SP 500 Index PL CL C. As I only just turned 24, I am not really interested in bonds and am willing to be aggressive and take on a bit of risk.

However, I have also opened up a Roth IRA where I contribute about an additional 5% of my earnings. It seems a bit trickier to select funds as there are a lot more to choose from. I would also like to be aggressive so I've been looking at investing in something like FNILX, which has an expense ratio of 0, or QQQ, which seems to be a known and and reputable fund.

I know that I said that I want to be aggressive and avoid bonds, but I'm also wondering if investing in something like QQQ or FNILX is redundant given my 401k fund.

Should I incorporate more international funds to compliment what I already have?

&lt;p&gt;Until the last couple of weeks, I have been investing investing up to my employer match of 6%. I have since changed this to 10% as I am trying to invest more aggressively. Out of the Fidelity funds available for me to select, I have chosen the SP 500 Index PL CL C. As I only just turned 24, I am not really interested in bonds and am willing to be aggressive and take on a bit of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have also opened up a Roth IRA where I contribute about an additional 5% of my earnings. It seems a bit trickier to select funds as there are a lot more to choose from. I would also like to be aggressive so I&amp;#39;ve been looking at investing in something like FNILX, which has an expense ratio of 0, or QQQ, which seems to be a known and and reputable fund.&lt;/p&gt;

I work in the auto industry, so things are a bit shaky right now which has me wondering on what I should do in my current situation.

My wife and I really don't have any debt other than a mortgage and both of our car payments.

1. How quickly will her credit score increase after dealing with this? There are no other issues of any kind on her report. We have a mortgage we have been paying at an accelerated rate over the the past five years, including extra payments and out credit utilization rate is very low.

My employer offers a non-matched 401k which I've been using because it's easy. Wife and I make enough where we can't do a Roth IRA without using the backdoor method, and also make enough so that IRA contributions don't lower our taxes (I think that's how it works?). In case it matters, she has a great 50% matched 401k which she fills up every year, and I should retire with a great employer sponsored pension and health insurance from my union, so these retirement savings under discussion are more supplemental than primary.

We live in a HCOL area so we make a lot and spend a lot. For what it's worth, I grew up modestly and can see myself retiring that way. But it's good to have options

So far Ive learned the benefits of the 401k for my situation are that it lowers my taxable income, and the detriments are that it's 1) the most restrictive to access, and 2) doesn't have many investment options (offers goal-date funds with fidelity). The IRA seems annoying to deal with tax-wise (I contribute post-tax but somehow it's pretax), and the Roth IRA seems pretty cool.

&lt;p&gt;My employer offers a non-matched 401k which I&amp;#39;ve been using because it&amp;#39;s easy. Wife and I make enough where we can&amp;#39;t do a Roth IRA without using the backdoor method, and also make enough so that IRA contributions don&amp;#39;t lower our taxes (I think that&amp;#39;s how it works?). In case it matters, she has a great 50% matched 401k which she fills up every year, and I should retire with a great employer sponsored pension and health insurance from my union, so these retirement savings under discussion are more supplemental than primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a HCOL area so we make a lot and spend a lot. For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I grew up modestly and can see myself retiring that way. But it&amp;#39;s good to have options&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far Ive learned the benefits of the 401k for my situation are that it lowers my taxable income, and the detriments are that it&amp;#39;s 1) the most restrictive to access, and 2) doesn&amp;#39;t have many investment options (offers goal-date funds with fidelity). The IRA seems annoying to deal with tax-wise (I contribute post-tax but somehow it&amp;#39;s pretax), and the Roth IRA seems pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangent question: should I take advantage of the CARES act and move some of my 401k into last year&amp;#39;s and this year&amp;#39;s Roth IRAs (backdoor)?  I have a brokerage account with Vanguard and I like them. California.&lt;/p&gt;

I currently have a 30 year/4% loan (about 5 years in).  Bought the home for 300k and now its worth about 450k.  I owe 190k currently, and I have a HELOC opened for 60k that I have not accessed.

Do you all think it would be wise to:

1) Take the 15 year refi now and keep the HELOC?
2) Keep the 30 year mortgage and wait for better 15 year rates/until refi-cash outs are available, whenever that is?

I'm trying to figure out the best place to contribute the money I set aside for retirement each month. (Apologies if this is an easy q, but I haven't been able to find an answer using the PF wiki.)

For context: I'm 30, I'm a school social worker, and I'm making 75k (will go up to 80 in August when my new contract begins). I plan to stay at this job for a while, but I know that this salary is on the higher end for my profession, and I don't anticipate earning much more than 100k/year in the future. Right now, I contribute 11% to my 401k (employer matches 1%). I have a traditional IRA that I opened years ago with Fidelity with several thousand dollars in it, and just rolled over a Roth IRA that my parents had opened for me years ago to Fidelity, also with several thousand dollars.

My question: where should I be putting my retirement savings? Right now, I'm only actively contributing to my 401k. Does it make sense for me to contribute money more equally between the 401k, Roth, and traditional IRA? How would you advise me to contribute it, given that 401k is taken out pre-tax, but there are advantages at the time of withdrawal with IRAs?

,personalfinance,"Hi, everyone. I am going for an interview tomorrow! I do currently have a job. However, it is in an entry level position and pays minimum wage ($13 per hour) in a high cost of living area. I am college-edicated, have earned an important certification since I began working at my current job fourteen months ago and I am actively pursuing another highly regarded industry certification.

I have my hands in a little of everything, given that the company is just my boss and me (a small LLC). But most of my duties are administrative. Billing, invoicing, filing, etc. But I also create documents for clients, collect data, onboard them, send them forms they need, sit in on meetings and record the minutes, troubleshoot technology issues, help to ensure compliance, etc. Needless to say, my knowledge in the field is rapidly growing. 

I am already grossly underpaid, but when I was hired I really needed the money, so I took what I could get (I also came from a completely different industry and thus had no experience a year ago). 

The new job says starting salary is $40,000-45,000, equivalent to $19.23 to $21.63 per hour. But the person I've been in contact with says I will likely start closer to the $15-16 per hour range and be rapidly promoted to closer to $20 after an as yet undetermined probationary period, although an official offer has not been made.

I feel that with my additional knowledge above and beyond the basics of office administration, I should be paid more.

My question is this: Given the fact that I am only making $13 per hour currently, how hard should I negotiate for a higher salary right off the bat?

,personalfinance,"Hi All! I am currently employed in good standing with a US domestic airline as a flight attendant. However, due to a workplace injury, I have been out for almost 2 years and receiving worker's compensation benefits. In a few weeks, I will have reached the 2 year mark and will no longer receive work comp payments. After that, I will be applying for California state disability benefits. I cannot apply for disability until 7 days before my current worker's compensation benefits end, and I have no idea what my benefits for disability will look like, assuming I am granted any.  

Ok so:  I finish up spinal post-operation physical therapy with a goal of returning to work around August, but possibly delayed to the fall. Unfortunately, it is looking like my Airline will have furloughs starting October, very close to when I hoped to finally be back full time. 

In the interest of planning ahead, my question is regarding **what will count as 'income' when I do file for unemployment.**  

* 2 years of worker's compensation payments. 
* small, not steady monthly paychecks from my company, usually under $200. These were infrequent and only so I could stay on company health insurance, etc. They were taxed accordingly. 
* Possible Disability payments I would receive in a few weeks, between when work comp ends and until returning to work
* If I am able to return to work for a month or two before furloughs occur, payroll then would of course count towards past income. (side question, is it in my interest to work as much as possible if I return for even a month to help boost my 'past income'?)

Original post:

My student loan is divided into 4 sections. My regular monthly payment gets divided up and sent to each loan group based on the minimum monthly payment. Because of the current student loan forbearance I'm not making monthly payments. Instead of continuing to send the money to be evenly divided as usual, I thought this would be a good time to direct all my extra money to totally pay off the loan group with the highest interest and lowest dollar amount.

I was surprised earlier this year when I paid off my car loan and my credit score fell from 740 to 715. I figured out it was because one of the aspects of the credit score is ""Total Accounts"" and more open accounts is better. The score recovered since then and the only thing harming me is the short length of credit (5 years).

I now have 4 installment loans (student) and 1 revolving (credit card) account. Even though I am able to pay off one of the installment loans I am worried about the effect that having one fewer open account will have on my score. I think that the benefit of avoiding additional interest outweighs the potential negative impact to the score but I could be wrong.

,personalfinance,"Hello personalfinance!

Long time lurker here, wanted to get your guys input on my current situation.  Currently own a 2 bedroom condo in Southern California, but looking to upgrade to a single family home with at least 3 bedrooms.  Would you guys recommend pulling the trigger now and getting in to a new home or wait it out a few more years to save more of a down payment?

Here is a breakdown of our current situation:

* Household income: $210K ($140K me, $70K wife), both in stable jobs, take home is about $10K a month, with bonuses quarterly of $5K - take home about $2.7K after taxes
* Down payment savings = $105K ($35K + \~$70K in equity at the moment in our condo)
* Current mortgage w/ HOA fee: $3,154 (tax and insurance is impounded)
* CC Debt: $0, all other expenses budgeted monthly: $2,500-$3,000 which includes all entertainment expenses as well
* No kids at the moment, have family that has committed to day care once that is part of the plan down the road

We are looking at houses in the $750K range but I am hesitant to take our mortgage too high. I know we would have to pay a chunk for PMI but I am confident that the mortgage calculators are overestimating what our PMI would be monthly. Would it make sense to get in to the new house now without a full 20% down payment?  I know rates are very low right now and am confident we could secure a great rate.

May 2nd I found out someone had accessed my savings account and made a series of transfers out of the account without my knowledge. This started April 17th. I called my bank and disputed the charges. Then I found out 2 additional accounts were accessed and had money transferred out of them. I called those banks and reported the fraud. Then I found out the attacker also accessed my email and created filtering rules to delete email notifications about transfers from those three banks.

I formatted my computer which is my only suspicion for how this happened. I changed all my passwords. I froze my credit with all 3 bureaus. I also added a fraud alert to all 3 bureaus. I pulled my free credit report to verify no additional lines of credit had been created. I also filed a police report with my local police department. 

The 3 banks did refund the money to my accounts, contingent on an ongoing investigation. By all rights they should find the transfers really were fraudulent, but it makes me really nervous they could rule against me and then I'd have to escalate somehow. 

Then over the next few days I received bank cards from new bank accounts in my name. The first was for a ""Stride Bank / Chime Me"" Bank. I had never heard of this bank before. The money from the first savings account was transferred to this ""Stride Bank"" but I do not know how the attacker planned to access the money. 

Then I received another bank card from ""Green Dot Bank / Unlimited Cash Back Bank Account"". This was also fraudulently opened in my name. I called and reported the fraud to the bank. The bank refused to tell me any details about when the account was opened, if there were any funds in the account, or if any withdrawals occurred.

Today I received another bank card from a third bank ""Green Dot Bank / Walmart Money Card"". I am currently on hold with this bank - which has the same ""thank you for your patience"" voice as the Green Dot Bank I called yesterday.

I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know how to stop additional bank accounts from being opened in my name. I have currently been on hold over 90 minutes waiting for the fraud department. I am so worn out on talking to these banks. I also don't know what the attacker was planning to do with these bank accounts. I guess maybe he had online access and could withdraw the money without the bank card? Or was he planning on raiding my mailbox (since he has my address and all) to get the physical bank card?

Can anyone shed any light on what the attacker is trying to accomplish? Should I expect even more bank accounts in the mail? I am hopeful that these 3 bank accounts corresponded to the 3 of my real bank accounts that were attacked, and maybe there won't be any more.

&lt;p&gt;Would it generally be advisable to take advantage of this? Would it affect how we build credit? Deduct our interest from our taxes each year? What other considerations would we want to take into account, other than any family issues that might come up (Very good relationship with my mother and stepfather - No drama in the years he has been in my family).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

I plan to use Schwab as my main brokerage. Why do people recommend I buy Schwab funds?

I currently already own some Vanguard ETF shares in my Schwab account. Is this a mistake? Does it make a difference which company's ETF I invest in?

I just signed a 30 year fixed rate mortgage which is substantially lower than my previous interest rate (which was a 30 year fixed at 4.75% with 28 years remaining).

,personalfinance,"Hello,

I am in a high paying job but I will leave it in a few months. It is a contracting job overseas and I want to go back to the United States.

**My Savings:**

3k - HYSA

4k - Taxable Brokerage

13k - ROTH IRA

9k - 401k

8k - 401k 

3k - Checking account

&amp;#x200B;

Taxes - 4607.36

Deduction - 188.81

401k - 2025.5

Net income - 6682.84

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly spending**

2400 Mortgage

600 bills 

3000 HYSA

682 remainder (prob more hysa)

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

I have virtually no savings right now because I just bought a house.

329,000 k remainder, 4.5% APR. I will refinance as soon as I get an opportunity upon my return.

No doubt, I am in a very fortunate position. However, I want to go home and enjoy my life in the United States. I want to settle down and start a family.

The problem is, I am not sure what I want to do when I go home. My current job overseas is a defense contract and my job isn't really applicable in the states. 

I do have a bachelor's degree from a top school but it is in a science field I no longer want to puruse.

I have a job offer from a three letter agency but it is in the East Coast. I bought my house in the West Coast.

I have not filed my 2019 taxes yet. I have extended until October. The reason being is that I will be eligible for the FEIE in July 15th. I think I'll get a good chunk back.

I'm trying to hold on to December 2020. This way, i can do FEIE for 2020 and get a large chunk back. it is about 20k I get in tax returns if I stay here the whole time. Maybe a lil less because CA. 

The reason I bought my house is because I found out my immediate family (mom and sibling) were next to homeless. As an exchange, they take care of my house while my sibling is finishing college and I am doing whatever I want overseas.

Once my sibling graduates college, I will let them build savings for a year and then will have them leave.

My mom, she can come or go. I think she wants to leave. I don't mind, there are plenty of rooms in the home.

I  have a few large purchases that I need to save up for

\- Refinancing my house. 

\- A car. I think I am going to get a cheap car under 10k? A used Honda or something.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questons**

1) Should I maintain my 401k contribution rate at this economical climate? My fundamentals says yes because DCA, time in the market blah blah

2) My 401k is a traditional because my tax bracket is pretty high especially in California. After I quit here, I was going to take a year off and then just convert my trad 401k to my roth IRA. (allowed?)

I think this is a good idea because I will get a tax break for 2020 and can get money into my ROTH while my taxable income is low during 2021.

3) I am going to take a few months off. To do some soul searching on what I want to do.Therefore, I need to save up for a year of savings. 3000 x 12 = 36,000 in my HYSA seem reasonable?

4) Off topic quetsion, does anyone have any recommendations of career advice? I don't really want to work in Defense anymore. Nor do I want to work in biochem (degree).

,personalfinance,"Hello everyone! I know that PF hates financing new cars from what I’ve read but most of the horror stories seem to be people that are already struggling before getting into a car loan. 

Anyway about me I am in my late 20’s and have always just paid in full in cash for all of my cars. They all inevitably break down after a few years and I repeat this cycle. The current car I was in got t-boned and is still drivable but it has just gotten away from me. Check engine light on, brake light on, side mirror destroyed, registration out etc. I’ve avoided repairing these things (all recent things) because I’ve been planning on moving on to a new car soon anyway. I work in management for a large medical company and just got a big promotion and have fantastic job security. The only downside is I’ve not done much throughout my life to improve my credit and have had a few things zap the life out of my credit score until it settled at 568 which is where it’s at now. 

I’m at a point where instead of buying beaters to get through the life I want to get a reliable, new car that I will have for quite some time and gets great gas mileage for my commute and that will also allow me to help build my credit in conjunction with secured credit card, etc. 

I have started the process at a Toyota dealership with a 2019 Corolla that only has 10k miles on it. They’re selling it for $13,990 which is below market for it. At first they were estimating my terms to be 5k down with a payment of $286/month over the dreaded 72 months. After leaving last night I played around their website and looked at what if I bought the car online from them and it came to 4k down and $281/month. 

From what I’ve been told by friends and family I should go in there and tell them I have 4k to put down and that I could do a monthly rate of 260 instead of 286 and tell them if they can match that then I would buy. 

Now I know my interest rate is going to be astronomical and easily 20%+ which adds an insane amount of money paid out in interest over the 72 months. I figured that I have another 6k in bonuses arriving next month and was planning on using another 2k of that to pay on the principle and to repeat that next year when my bonuses come in as well. I also plan on 6 months down the line attempting to refinance with my credit union that I’ve been at for 5 years (they denied my application for initial financing) to work on getting the interest rate down lower.",t2_lznwt,False,,0,False,"Bad credit but good job, financing a car for the first time",[],r/personalfinance,False,6,Auto,0,False,t3_gim984,False,light,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Auto,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589352274.0,text,6,,,text,self.personalfinance,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!

I also plan on 6 months down the line attempting to refinance with my credit union that I’ve been at for 5 years (they denied my application for initial financing) to work on getting the interest rate down lower.&lt;/p&gt;

I work for an essential business, on salary, and it's very unlikely anything will affect my job status at my current company. My wife is currently finishing her masters, and will begin as a teacher in the Fall. I'm 27, married, and we own our home. We have about $10k in savings and $30k in a 401k. We have 2 credit cards w/ total of $15k limit, and we don't carry a balance. One card is 0% APR for 9 more months, and I can transfer some of the credit limit from the other card to this one if desired.

I purchased the home back in January 2018, and it was a new home that had no landscaping done to the backyard. I've kinda slacked off from getting it done since then, but being recently married has now made me want to have our backyard landscaped. I estimate that my plans for the backyard will cost about $15k. I also believe that this pandemic will allow for there to be great discounts on projects such as this.

With the recent US stimulus package, it enables me to loan from my 401k penalty-free. Would it be a reasonable decision to pull $10k from the 401k to fund my home improvement project? I understand that pulling from it now may make me miss out when the economy begins coming back. But I also don't foresee the economy coming back quickly, and believe most of the loan could be repaid prior to the stock market rebounding.

Thanks in advance!

**Edit**: Thank you for all of the replies. From the responses, it seems like this is not the best way to go about it. I initially figured that getting \~20% savings on the project from doing it during the pandemic would offset the earnings I would've received if I don't pull from the 401k.

- I have decent but minimal credit as I typically prefer to pay for things upfront. I bought my last vehicle with cash, pay my auto insurance yearly rather than monthly, and paid for my university tuition in full each year.

1.) Can the fraud recovery department go back on their word and re mark me as beneficiary again and don't give me the credit?

,personalfinance,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking with my brother and I'm now trying to figure out the best way to set myself up for a better financial future. 

I currently have 36,000 in student loan debt.

I will be going to school in a few weeks to get a second bachelor's degree as a registered nurse. The tuition will be paid by the post 9/11 GI bill in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Program so I don't need to worry about that. 

While in school I will be making about 4,000 a month (tax free) between VA disability and the stipend from the GI bill.

I was originally going to take this time to aggressively pay off my student loans, but I'm now wondering if perhaps I should refinance to a lower rate, pay them off at a longer time and take the extra money and invest in the market. Right now my interest rates for the loans are at 0% until at least September due to the Coronavirus legislation. After that, I believe they sit somewhere at about 5%.

I have about 15k in savings, 3k in mutual funds, 15k in retirement, and 1k cash. I only pay 250 in rent, for the next year, but will move after that.

,personalfinance,"First-time Home Buyer (potentially) here in need of advice.

My wife and I recently welcomed our first child, and we are beginning to consider possibly leaving our rental and purchasing a home. We have been paying $1200/month for the last year and a half on our rental home, which is an old home but is enough space for our small family. Currently, before tax, our combined income is approx. 120k/year.

Growing up, my parents never owned a home, therefore I am extremely hesitant to take the plunge without careful evaluation. My primary hang up is that I recently graduated law school with $80k in student loans. Luckily, the $80k is the only debt that we have. Both cars are paid off and we have never used a credit card. I've recently started a stable job, therefore our plan is to begin to aggressively pay off this student loan in order to become debt free. If we were to purchase a home, we have agreed to keep it under $200k, which would buy a nice home in our area of the country.

My question is this: would it be smarter to pay off my student loan completely over the next 3-4 years/continue to rent before purchasing a home? Or is it feasible to own a home in that price range while simultaneously paying off the $80k? I feel that my earning capacity has great upside, but the thought of taking on additional debt on top of my student loans does make me hesitant, especially considering that there is not necessarily anything wrong with our current living situation. Should I save money for a down payment while also paying off the $80k? Or focus all energy towards the student loan?

Should I save money for a down payment while also paying off the $80k? Or focus all energy towards the student loan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hi,

I’m 23 years old and I’ve been a licensed driver for almost three years. I have State Farm and pay 200 bucks a month for my 2017 Hyundai Sonata (full coverage).

So my question is, do you guys have any advice on how to get a better deal? I’ve never been in a crash, no speeding tickets, don’t drink or smoke, and I only really drive to and from work (or I did anyway).

When I first got with them I was paying around 300. 200 is obviously better but I can’t help but feel ripped off. I’ve been with the same company for a while now and I’m a good driver. Never missed a payment either.

Also I pay 383 a month for my car payment. I called the other day and my bank said that the pay out was 12,500. I have enough to pay it all off, but I was conflicted as to what I should do.

My mom says that it’s good to have a car payment because it shows that you’re reliable, but I’ve had it for 1 year and 7 months. Do I gain anything by continuing to have this payment? Is it better to just refinance it?

I don’t have much knowledge in these topics and I would appreciate some help.

Thanks.

,personalfinance,"Hi PF community,

I wanted to see if anyone here who is either a math person or who specializes in mortgage amortization can help me through the application of a graduated-payment mortgage formula. The formula in question is equation 8 at the bottom of the 6th page of this document: https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/D_Winkler_Graduated_1998(MULTI%20UNCG%20AUTHORS).pdf

My question is--how do I manipulate the formula to re-amortize partway through the repayment period? I'm not a math person at all, and I have to believe there's some algebra involved, or changing one of the exponents, or something like that. 

For example, say there are 5 payment tiers (the initial one followed by 4 graduations), and each payment tier lasts for 2 years before the next one, so this would be a 10-year graduated mortgage, or 120 monthly payments. Say I get the value for the initial payment, and then I derive the values of the other payments with PMT(1 + g)^t. But then, say the borrower becomes delinquent, or goes through a period of forbearance or whatever, and this occurs after month 6. Now, the lender re-amortizes the payments so that the mortgage is still paid off within 10 years. How now do I derive the value of the next 18 payments for the first tier, and then the corresponding 4 subsequent tiers?

This might be really simple--again, I'm not a math person.

This is for the fastest debt pay off. I'm fortunate to have steady work during this quarantine with 1 fulltime, and 2 part time jobs. Reserve Military is 1 of them which is why the low apr and no annual fees. Unfortunately the pandemic prevented the scenario that would keep going after June 2nd. So to be safe I want to put myself in a better position to not accrue more interest in that time. I tend to keep all my cards paid off except the SR(Chase Sapphire Reserve). The SR was at 20k about 5 months ago and I intend to make a minimum $1500 monthly payment to my debt, in addition to keeping secondary cards at $0 after the statement is posted. To stay at 0% through the end of the year as I pay this down I considered **balance transfer card(s)**. I figure I can get it paid off in 8 months or less if done right.

&lt;p&gt;This is for the fastest debt pay off. I&amp;#39;m fortunate to have steady work during this quarantine with 1 fulltime, and 2 part time jobs. Reserve Military is 1 of them which is why the low apr and no annual fees. Unfortunately the pandemic prevented the scenario that would keep going after June 2nd. So to be safe I want to put myself in a better position to not accrue more interest in that time. I tend to keep all my cards paid off except the SR(Chase Sapphire Reserve). The SR was at 20k about 5 months ago and I intend to make a minimum $1500 monthly payment to my debt, in addition to keeping secondary cards at $0 after the statement is posted. To stay at 0% through the end of the year as I pay this down I considered &lt;strong&gt;balance transfer card(s)&lt;/strong&gt;. I figure I can get it paid off in 8 months or less if done right. See my stats below and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

So long story short, my mom dated/lived with a guy for many years.  I lived with them for a bit after I graduated from college, and during this time my mom got cancer and myself her boyfriend (we'll call him Dan) and I took care of her. He worked and I stayed in to take care of her until she passed and we became very close.  He's like a second father to me.  Well his Dan's Dad passed and left him a size-able amount of stock, of which was willed 7 of his children inlcuding Dan.  One of Dan's fathers wishes was to have his children also do the same for 7 people and since Dan has no kids I guess I'm it.   


He rang and told me to make an account with Schwab and to send him the 8 numbers after detailing the amount of shares he was going to give.  I don't know anything about the Stock except its current value, and there's about 125 shares of it for now, and every year in January he's going to give me more.  I'ts not millionaire numbers but if I'm smart now it could take care of me in retirement many many years down the road.  


So what kind of account do I need to open?  The Schwab website was so confusing.  On the Make an Account Page it has so many options.  Is it a Brokerage?  I think I'll just continue to live on my job's earnings and maybe learn how to invest or at least watch the value go up or go down for a bit since the market sounds like its all over the place right now.  I could use the money to start paying off my student loans which is a huge goal for me as I move into my 30's.

**TLDR -**   
**Accidentally removed myself from the employer-provided health insurance plan, feeling pretty vulnerable, physically with covid and mentally with the potential expenses if I get sick for what so ever reason -  what are my options?**

My partner got a new job and since their employer provides health insurance benefits, I wanted to take them off of my employer's Kaiser plan. In the process, I, unfortunately, removed myself too. The bigger mistake, I did not read the selections email either. This happened in March 1st week. 

I realized that this has happened when I tried to reorder a prescription this month and got an automated call that my membership has been terminated.

I am trying to appeal this with my employer's benefits provider and in the meanwhile wanted to tap into the hive mind here to understand what my other options are. The current situation adds more soup to my situation and I am legit scared right now. The appeal timeline is typically 30 days and I am trying to find a solution for the interim. Here's what I have thought of so far -  

1. I explored is to add myself to my partner's plan but if I put the qualifying event data as of March, the system tells us that this is out of the 31-day window in which we can register for a qualifying event. 
2. I started looking up insurance providers online and they are expensive and very confusing. Even after paying hundreds of dollars, the coverage is quite limited and the out of pocket is sky-high.

So I am looking for advice on the following - 

* Is there anything else I can do or explore in addition to the above options while I wait for the appeal to come back?
* Can I put in a date that is in the 31-day window for option 1 above? I am pretty sure the answer is no but I wanted to check anyway. (I am kinda desperate here).
* Any resources/companies/plans that offer decent coverage at reasonable prices if I want to buy something in the interim or heck, even for the rest of the year in the worst case?

,personalfinance,"Hey everyone, sorry for throwaway but I don't like mingling my personal/important business with my main/chilled account.

My family has sold an appartment and has about $127K in the bank from the sale. We are currently renting a house at $1200 per month. We also have close to 0 debt as of right now.

My mom wants to buy a house for around $160k and take a loan from the bank, in our current situation the only actual income is hers. My brother and his girlfriend can put some money up, but because of the pandemic affecting his area of work I'm not certain he can keep it coming or for how long he can sustain it. I've also been affected by the pandemic circumstances (not sick lol thank god) and am currently out of a job. No savings in any case either.

My brother might have some but definitely not a whole lot. If we bought the house we would have around $300 left after the bank's monthly fee to be used for electricity, water, and such. We would have around $30 for food and shit and my (older) brother and his gf are expected to chip in to cover the costs as well. I'm also expected to chip in as soon as I can get a job. We live in a third world country so keep that in mind, food is cheaper I assume than in the US or Europe.

So we have two options, please help me choose or consider them:

**OPTION 1:** We can rent and keep our savings until me and my brother can get going again so we stop using the savings cause of our better situation and then reasess if its worth purchasing or just keep renting until we're secure enough financially to buy. 

**OPTION 2:** We can buy now and have a secure roof for years to come, but have barely enough money to actually do anything. If my brother's area of work doesn't recover in due time we might be in serious financial trouble (in my opinion).

**Please read this** 

In my mind putting ourselves in such a risky financial situation by buying a house puts us way more in jeopardy than having savings in an account. It also allows us to take advantage of the pandemic by finding cheaper renting prices imo. 

The other point of view is that with the coming depression/recession, the economy will plummet, the dollar will lose its value and our savings will be worth shit by then so its better to spend on something tangible.

So, should we buy the house and get a loan or rent and assess in the future PLEASE ADVICE!

&lt;p&gt;Second question: aside from the higher income tax % since the salary is so much higher, I also need to pay an additional 7.5% FICA tax, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added up all the stuff my employer contributes and its 1075/month after converting PTO to $. Including the annual bonus its $2300/month. 2300*12 = 27,600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean to compare the two job offers, I should just add about ~28k to my current salary, and compare that to the annual W2 salary after taking 7.5% off due to the extra FICA (or is that only for 1099s?), then remove the extra income tax I have to pay due to the higher salary? Is that a proper way to compare?&lt;/p&gt;

So I scraped the money together, called the debt collector and got a settlement agreement. Got the money order at the post office, stuffed it in an envelope and paid for standard posting before going home and brushing my shoulders off. 10 days later, they called and said they haven&amp;#39;t received it, I &amp;quot;broke&amp;quot; the agreement and now they want the full amount.  Well, in these unprecedented times I didn&amp;#39;t factor in that mail delivery would be effected, and I should have paid for express shipping and delivery confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story, kids: If you&amp;#39;re gonna pay the debt collector and you choose to mail it, pay the extra $$$ for overnight express (or Fed Ex it) , have it certified and get delivery confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hello,
As we know, life happens and the projected path you saw yourself taking one day can change the next.  In this case, having an FHA loan is complicating that.  We bought our house back in October, so a little over seven months ago.  According to the information I've been able to dig up, occupancy for the FHA loan is a minimum of one year.  I see there are some exceptions, such as job relocation.  However, all the articles I can find only talk about FHA allowing you to buy a second property with a second FHA loan.  Specifically, we are trying to find out if job relocation will allow us to rent out the property ahead of the one year mark.  Otherwise, our options are to continue to pay for another five months and making it appear like we live there and then rent it out, or selling it for a major loss.  
The house was bought at $153k with 3.5% down.  Monthly payments including taxes, HOA, insurance, ect are under $1400 (taxes in the area are super high).  Rental market for the house would be around $1600.  From what I understand this isn't the greatest margin and wouldn't leave room to use a management company, we'd have to manage ourselves or have family in the area take care of small repairs and coordinate any larger ones that arise.  The good part is, while it is a single family home the HOA takes care of all roofing, siding, and landscape.  So there is no risk of a high cost repair to the exterior of the home.  All windows were recently replaced as well.  Our main risk with the house itself would come from plumbing or electrical issues arising (or some massive, unavoidable disaster).
The other, obvious, option is to sell.  I know that we have basically no equity built up at this point.  Down payment is a loss and 10% to cover sales expenses would be around $15k.  We don't even have $15k to cover the sales expenses at this point.  We'd also probably have to put in about $3k-5k or so to make the home more appealing.  The previous owner did a shotty job painting the cabinets in the kitchen, the stairs, and the vanity in the bathroom.  This can all easily be stripped and stained.  The appliances are mismatched, but at this price point of a home I don't see that as a huge deal.  We would want to put in new carpet in the bedrooms, it's not in horrible shape but could use a facelift.  Also, the doors are the ugly builder grade brown and we would want to put in white to make it look more polished.  These are all things we would do before renting it out anyway to make it more appealing and possibly getting more towards the $1700 range for rent (still within market). 
I'm mainly looking for advice on what the best course of action would be.  We're leaning towards making repairs, ""living there"" for 5 more months, and then renting it out.

&lt;p&gt;When I was 18 I inherited around 164k. I went to college, got a useless psych degree and now live at home w parents trying to figure out my next step. Since then I have been stuck in retail management but have saved 52k on my own. So I’m a 26f with a useless degree and around 215k.

I wanted to live in my hometown of Nashville and she wanted to live in her hometown of Memphis, so we compromised and moved to Memphis. 

Her parents have a large 5 bedroom home so I moved in with them. They’re both elderly so my GF and myself clean, cook, etc for them and we get to live rent free. But it’s time to get our own place and do something with my money.

- 70k Student Loans. The only reason I haven’t paid them off is because I’m terrified of paying 70k for loan forgiveness to pass. 

-7k Truck Note (500/month payment)

- 130 monthly insurance

And In regards to housing, my GF and I plan on moving to Middle Tennessee in 2-3 years. She wants to flip a house and I want to rent an apartment. 

So.. 

1. What’s a buffer note? Does the advisors suggestions sound good?

What happened with my roommate: She moved out last week, didn't pay rent for May, and has left over $1500 in damages to the master. The full story is posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gaq19p/colorado_us_my_roommate_is_attempting_to_break/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gg6ezg/roommate_moved_out_with_no_warning_did_not_pay/).

I am paying her half of the rent today and I understand I have to pay for the damages to the master. I intend to take this matter to small claims, but it looks like it could take years to recover the money. In the meantime, I need help deciding what I should do. 

-----



**Option 1**: My leasing office is working with me, thankfully. They are not charging late fees and they are giving me the option to transfer to a one bedroom apartment. They are also giving me the option to break up the $1500 into 12 payments if I move to a one bedroom and sign a new 12 month lease. The one bedroom apartment costs $1150/m (before utilities). If I take this option, I will $1275/m over the next year. I would also need to pack and hire movers (I'm on the 4th floor and the only one bedroom they have is on the 3rd floor of a different building).

**Option 2**: Stay in the two bedroom and find another roommate. This unit costs $1475/m (before utilities) total, which I am paying by myself for May. With a roommate, I only pay $737.5/m in rent. I still have to pay $1500 to have the bedroom repaired, which can be broken up into 12 payments. However, I can't have a new roommate move into the master bedroom until it's repaired. The carpet needs to be replaced, walls re-painted, and the bathroom counters need to be re-surfaced. The apartment manager doesn't know how quickly they will be able to get this done, or if their vendors are able to do work in an occupied apartment due to COVID-19. If they can't do it, I have to find a way to make that bedroom livable on my own... and I don't think I can. Finding a new roommate also puts me at risk for this to happen again. This roommate was the second roommate to abandon the apartment with out notice in the last 9 months. The roommate before had a mental break down and went to live with family. While this is understandable, I still got screwed paying his half of the rent for a month.

I am a full time student and I will graduate in May of next year. At that point, I will either be going on to grad school or I'll be working full time in my new career. Right now, I work for the university part time making $13/hr. I can't work more than 30 hours a week as a full time student, and realistically, I can't work more than 20 hours a week with out compromising my performance in class. I am supplementing my income with scholarships, grants, and student loans. I'm on SNAP and Medicaid as well. I budget every dollar in 6-month increments to align with financial aid disbursements in January and August. It's barely enough to cover CoL. 


TL;DR: Roommate abandoned the lease and now I have to pay $1500 to have her bedroom repaired before I can find a new roommate. I am also paying double rent until the room is repaired. The apartment manager is offering to let me transfer to a one bedroom which will cost $400/m more than splitting a two bedroom with a roommate. I'm full time student barely making ends meet. Should I stay in the two bedroom and find a roommate if/when the repairs are made or move to the one bedroom?

Well I don&amp;#39;t have it yet (looked all around the house for it too), and that&amp;#39;s okay because I can find it online. I&amp;#39;m in the state of Colorado so I go to  &lt;a href=""https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/news/print-copy-your-tax-form-1099-g""&gt;https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/news/print-copy-your-tax-form-1099-g&lt;/a&gt; to print out the form and it takes me to a portal that requires a PIN to set up an account. I call the Labor and Unemployment office to get help and of course, their lines are consistently in use because, well, a lot of people are unemployed right now. All of the links requesting missing PIN numbers are all unemployment related. I did fill out a google doc and made a note where my name was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is what do I do next? Do I continue to fill out my taxes, submit it, and fill out that part when I finally get that information? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

First. My company uses a third party payroll system. ADP. Depending on how your company is set up if you use a third party for payroll they may also be your employer on UI’s system. So you work for company X but they use Company Y for payroll then your technical employer could be Y. Check that first. This turned out not to be my issues but it was a friends.

Second. WA’s UI dept sent my company a fax after we were deemed nonessential requesting information. Not an email, not a call but a fax. And they didn’t think to follow up after the fax so my status never left “pending”. So not only was nobody working but it was sent via a relic of past times. If you still have access to an HR or payroll department have them check for a fax. If they did get one they need to fax the information back and have them wait for confirmation.

,personalfinance,"Hi Everyone,

I would like some advice on what to do when setting up my 401(k). My employer matches up to 6% so I was planning on putting in 6% myself to get the maximum match, currently this would be ~$550/month total including their match. I would assume this is the right move? I'm 26 years old.


What I'm wondering about the most is what asset allocation model / investment options to choose. Below is a link to what I believe are the pages relevant to what I'm asking about. 


Would it be wise to go with the ""Maximum Growth Model"" for a while considering my age and slowly move towards more conservative investment options? Should I go with the ""Managed Account"" or handle it all myself and just match the percentages to the maximum growth model when picking my investment options to avoid the managed account fees? It seems like it would be fairly easy? This is all done online now, the papers I have are not how we sign up anymore.

&lt;p&gt;I also have a savings account, in which I keep four paychecks worth of funds. This account is for emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that you can remove money from your Roth IRA without paying a penalty as long as it is just the money you put into it, and not money you&amp;#39;ve generated within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, is there any reason I shouldn&amp;#39;t move money from my savings to my Roth IRA, to make the maximum yearly contribution? This way, I can make money off of the savings (my savings account makes no interest), but if there&amp;#39;s an emergency, I still have access to the savings as I can remove it from my Roth IRA with no penalty. Is there something I&amp;#39;m missing here?&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hey all, 

I moved out of my old apartment right before thanksgiving. Sometime in December I was sent my final invoice which said after they used my deposit I still owed $150 (cats messed up the carpet). I called the company that handles the apartments payment and paid on the phone with my credit card. Fast forward to January when I was paying my CC bill I saw a $150 charge to some strange LLC I had never seen before, looked into the company online and thought someone had got ahold of my CC and made the charge so I disputed it with my CC company.

About an hour after disputing the charge I realized that was the payment to my apartment and was a legit charge. I called my bank and they undid the dispute. However because it was a relatively small amount they had automatically approved the dispute and charged back the LLC. So now my CC statements show the following charges on the same day:
original charge to LLC for $150
refund sent back to me for $150
second charge to LLC for $150

The issues comes in that the LLC is saying I haven't paid them. They say all they see on their side is original charge being sent and then the original charge been taken back. I have sent them screen shots of my CC statements that show what I had outlined above and they passed it onto their finance team. At this point they said they are going to wait until the end of May to see if anything changes. 

My hopes are they are going to find the second charge and all is good. However on the phone they seem to be taking the approach that I still owe them money and if I can't prove I have already paid they are going to keep calling me.

,personalfinance,"Hello.  I've definitely been stumbling a bit financially the past few years and things came to a head this year.  I have about 50K in unsecured debt across credit cards/personal loans (all of which I have stopped paying the past few months).  Another 30k remaining on student loans (which I currently have deferred).  High unsecured debt is from a failed side business venture I had tried to keep going long after I should have let it die.  

I stopped paying because IRS told me I owed a large amount to them from 2018, and I'm currently trying to work things out with them.  

I currently make 75K in salary and get stock options, bonus, and other stock incentive payments.  My trouble with the IRS comes from all the stock income and my initial ignorance on how to handle the taxes on that properly.   I'm told I make too much money to declare full bankruptcy.  

I'm early 30's, I live in Boston, and partially support my partner as well.  We live pretty modestly, as much as one can for living in the Boston area.  Rent is still super high even with an old dilapidated apartment.  No family in the area, and they don't have money to spare anyway.  

I've been able to start saving a lot of money since I stopped paying the CCs/loan and put the student loans into deferment, I have about 15k of cash on hand, and could get another 50K or so if I cashed in a large chunk of my current stock holdings (80K minus what I would need to hold onto for taxes).  My hope is the IRS will accept a low monthly payment for what I owe them.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is what are my real options.  There is so much predatory ""help"" out there for people in debt, some of which I've already fallen prey to.  

I plan on getting my student loan payments back on track and getting squared away with the IRS.  Do I try to negotiate the unsecured debt in default?  Since it's unsecured, do I just write it off and basically lose any semblance of credit for another decade and deal with the annoyance of collections?  What are things I need to be concerned about from a position like this?  Garnished wages, jail time?

I&amp;#39;ve definitely been stumbling a bit financially the past few years and things came to a head this year.  I have about 50K in unsecured debt across credit cards/personal loans (all of which I have stopped paying the past few months).  Another 30k remaining on student loans (which I currently have deferred).  High unsecured debt is from a failed side business venture I had tried to keep going long after I should have let it die.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped paying because IRS told me I owed a large amount to them from 2018, and I&amp;#39;m currently trying to work things out with them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently make 75K in salary and get stock options, bonus, and other stock incentive payments.  My trouble with the IRS comes from all the stock income and my initial ignorance on how to handle the taxes on that properly.   I&amp;#39;m told I make too much money to declare full bankruptcy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m early 30&amp;#39;s, I live in Boston, and partially support my partner as well.  We live pretty modestly, as much as one can for living in the Boston area.  Rent is still super high even with an old dilapidated apartment.  No family in the area, and they don&amp;#39;t have money to spare anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been able to start saving a lot of money since I stopped paying the CCs/loan and put the student loans into deferment, I have about 15k of cash on hand, and could get another 50K or so if I cashed in a large chunk of my current stock holdings (80K minus what I would need to hold onto for taxes).  My hope is the IRS will accept a low monthly payment for what I owe them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to know is what are my real options.  There is so much predatory &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; out there for people in debt, some of which I&amp;#39;ve already fallen prey to.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on getting my student loan payments back on track and getting squared away with the IRS.  Do I try to negotiate the unsecured debt in default?  Since it&amp;#39;s unsecured, do I just write it off and basically lose any semblance of credit for another decade and deal with the annoyance of collections?  What are things I need to be concerned about from a position like this?  Garnished wages, jail time?  I feel like I can move forward successfully from here - it just seems like all the roads are so foggy and I&amp;#39;m all turned about.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Good morning y'all,

I've checked my credit score and aside from one 60 day late payment (&lt;$10 balance, just totally forgot I had the card... my bad...), it seems my lack of credit lines are hurting my score/making the impact of the late payment much higher. Here's my credit history:

2014: Opened a card at local credit union

2017: Opened airline credit card

2017: Opened car loan

2018: Opened cashback card

2019: 60 Day late payment

2019: Paid off car loan

So far only 3 credit cards, no other loans. Utilization around 2-3% at any time of roughly 30k limit across all cards.

After the late payment, my score tanked from 800+ and now is just above 650.

The initial credit pull will probably hit my credit a little more, but will the new credit card help get my score above 700 in the foreseeable future?

,personalfinance," 

Hello! I just graduated from college with a BS in Computer Science.  I've bee;n with my current company for about a year as an intern. At the end of last summer, I was offered 76K in a low cost of living area. I had planned to teach English abroad for a year for myself. I told my company my plans and they said that I could accept this offer and have the start date moved or I could stay an intern through the next summer and accept an offer then.

They said I'd be getting a new offer at the end of this summer regardless of whether I accepted this one, so I decided to reject it just in case other opportunities came up. Well, since COVID has hit, I'm not going to teach abroad, and I've decided to begin my career. All my coworkers have encouraged me to apply to other jobs in town so I can negotiate.

I've only gotten one response (probably due to COVID but who knows) and I had three interviews with different sectors within their company. From what it says online, the new company starts out at about 74K and doesn't have great 401K options. My current company's 401K options are about average for the industry.

I haven't asked my current employer to be promoted to full time yet. Since the new company's starting pay will likely be less than I was previously offered, I'd likely have to ask them for more before asking my current employer for more. Because of lockdown and me basically having to ask for a promotion at my current company, I'd love some advice for handling this in the most professional way possible.

,personalfinance,"This is more of a rant, but I still wanted to share because it's hilarious and you can laugh at me. And then hopefully I can get some insight on easier ways to do this in the future...

Objective: Move a semi-large amount of cash from my savings (Growth) account with PNC (.15% APY) to a new Capital One 360 High Yield Savings account (1.5% APY). There was a promo for a $100 bonus **for every $10,000 deposited within 10 days of opening**. The amount I wanted to move is $30,000. Normally I wouldn't really care, I know the HYS rates are probably going to go down any day now, but I figured why not take advantage of the ""free"" $300 in bonus money and hang onto the higher APY as long as I can.

Here is what I did:

* Day 1 Friday: Got set up on my new CapOne 360 Account. Added my wife as a joint account holder. Easy Peasy. However, hindsight being 20/20, I should have opened this account on a Monday and not a Friday night. Possibly an issue later on with the 10 day funding period.
* Day 2-3-4 Saturday-Sunday-Monday: Set up my external account for CapOne360 at PNC for online transfer. Wait for the two small deposits to verify the account link. I see them on Monday and verify the account.
* **Problem: Daily external transfer limit with PNC is $15,000, Monthly Transfer limit $25,000.** Shit\*\*.\*\* I now realize that I will not be able to use this method to get the $300 bonus I wanted, and at most I could only get the $200 bonus with this method. I really should have looked into limits before hand, but it never really crossed my mind. Oh well.. let's call PNC.
* Day 4.5 Monday: Call PNC and go through the telephone wire transfer service. The guy on the phone talks me out of doing it over the phone because a.) I have never done a wire transfer over the phone with PNC before and I need to fill out paperwork with them b.) it will probably take about 45 minutes to 1 hour on the phone with him to get it set up. He says if there is a local branch near me that I could do a drive-thru wire transfer during the COVID stuff. Since I did not have an hour at that time to work with him on the phone I decided I would try going to the branch drive-thru. I call the only branch that's a reasonable distance to me and they did not answer the phone.. sigh.
* Day 4.75 Monday evening: Well this day is shot. So I initiate a transfer to my new account for $15,000 just to get something going in case I can't get it all there within the 10 days. Knowing there is a daily limit, I then schedule a $10,000 transfer the following day getting to my maximum $25,000 monthly transfer. Then I write a personal check to myself for $5000 (Daily CapOne Mobile Deposit Limit) and do a mobile deposit to my new Cap One 360 account. This part actually worked the smoothest.
* Day 5 Tuesday: **Problem: PNC emails me and says my $10,000 transfer has been canceled because it exceeded my monthly limit**. DUH.. I have other transfers/bills scheduled to go to external accounts regularly. Completely forget that would eat into my monthly limits. Now I'm thinking, the personal check worked so well.. I'll just write 2 more $5000 checks to myself and deposit them in the app. WRONG. **Problem: $10,000 mobile deposit monthly limit with CapOne360**. So at most I could do one more $5000 personal check to myself this month and have to figure out an alternate way to get the remaining $5000 to my new account before the 10 days is up.

Summary: I took a relatively easy concept, and I thought I could save time by doing stuff online. If I would have done my homework I would have gone with the paperwork route and the hour on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I did one more personal check, and was able to schedule a $5000 delivery out of PNC to cap one 360 for tomorrow. Keeping under my $25k monthly cap. Unfortunately I'm still within a 24 hour window of my last mobile deposit.. so more to come on that if I can deposit it tonight.

The other question remains.. ~~will everything clear by the 18th to get my $300 bonus. I'm betting not.~~

And then hopefully I can get some insight on easier ways to do this in the future...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: Move a semi-large amount of cash from my savings (Growth) account with PNC (.15% APY) to a new Capital One 360 High Yield Savings account (1.5% APY). There was a promo for a $100 bonus &lt;strong&gt;for every $10,000 deposited within 10 days of opening&lt;/strong&gt;. The amount I wanted to move is $30,000. Normally I wouldn&amp;#39;t really care, I know the HYS rates are probably going to go down any day now, but I figured why not take advantage of the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; $300 in bonus money and hang onto the higher APY as long as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1 Friday: Got set up on my new CapOne 360 Account. Added my wife as a joint account holder. Easy Peasy. However, hindsight being 20/20, I should have opened this account on a Monday and not a Friday night. Possibly an issue later on with the 10 day funding period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2-3-4 Saturday-Sunday-Monday: Set up my external account for CapOne360 at PNC for online transfer. Wait for the two small deposits to verify the account link. I see them on Monday and verify the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem: Daily external transfer limit with PNC is $15,000, Monthly Transfer limit $25,000.&lt;/strong&gt; Shit**.** I now realize that I will not be able to use this method to get the $300 bonus I wanted, and at most I could only get the $200 bonus with this method. I really should have looked into limits before hand, but it never really crossed my mind. Oh well.. let&amp;#39;s call PNC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 4.5 Monday: Call PNC and go through the telephone wire transfer service. The guy on the phone talks me out of doing it over the phone because a.) I have never done a wire transfer over the phone with PNC before and I need to fill out paperwork with them b.) it will probably take about 45 minutes to 1 hour on the phone with him to get it set up. He says if there is a local branch near me that I could do a drive-thru wire transfer during the COVID stuff. Since I did not have an hour at that time to work with him on the phone I decided I would try going to the branch drive-thru. I call the only branch that&amp;#39;s a reasonable distance to me and they did not answer the phone.. sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 4.75 Monday evening: Well this day is shot. So I initiate a transfer to my new account for $15,000 just to get something going in case I can&amp;#39;t get it all there within the 10 days. Knowing there is a daily limit, I then schedule a $10,000 transfer the following day getting to my maximum $25,000 monthly transfer. Then I write a personal check to myself for $5000 (Daily CapOne Mobile Deposit Limit) and do a mobile deposit to my new Cap One 360 account. This part actually worked the smoothest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 5 Tuesday: &lt;strong&gt;Problem: PNC emails me and says my $10,000 transfer has been canceled because it exceeded my monthly limit&lt;/strong&gt;. DUH.. I have other transfers/bills scheduled to go to external accounts regularly. Completely forget that would eat into my monthly limits. Now I&amp;#39;m thinking, the personal check worked so well.. I&amp;#39;ll just write 2 more $5000 checks to myself and deposit them in the app. WRONG. &lt;strong&gt;Problem: $10,000 mobile deposit monthly limit with CapOne360&lt;/strong&gt;. So at most I could do one more $5000 personal check to myself this month and have to figure out an alternate way to get the remaining $5000 to my new account before the 10 days is up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: I took a relatively easy concept, and I thought I could save time by doing stuff online. If I would have done my homework I would have gone with the paperwork route and the hour on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I did one more personal check, and was able to schedule a $5000 delivery out of PNC to cap one 360 for tomorrow. Keeping under my $25k monthly cap. Unfortunately I&amp;#39;m still within a 24 hour window of my last mobile deposit.. so more to come on that if I can deposit it tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other question remains.. &lt;del&gt;will everything clear by the 18th to get my $300 bonus. I&amp;#39;m betting not.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I confirmed with Capital One 360 that as long as the initiation of the transfer is done before the 10 days then I&amp;#39;ll be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

Per the title, the family trust created by mu grandfather revolved around a large piece of commercial property which was just finally sold to one of the current tenants. He took on 20-year mortgage instead of paying cash up front, and because of this, the inheritance to all of the family members went from being an expected windfall to a monthly sum paid out over 20 years.

For my situation: I am 37, making $135K/yr, with an established emergency fund, a roth IRA (never maxed on any year), and a 401K that has sat dormant for 2 years.

I have a checking and savings (used as my emergency fund) account with a single bank, some, my IRA with Vanguard, and some trivial investment stuff.

My not-well-defined plan had me thinking id use the windfall inheritance to buy a house, but now that its no longer a windfall, im not really sure what to do to best accommodate that kind of plan. Should I open an account at a new location and just keep dumping this new income into there? Should I maybe just consider it part of my current salary and forge ahead with bolstering retirement funds?

Im sure any answer “depends,” but basically despite having an emergency fund and a good amount in my checking, I dont have any money especially “saved” for a down payment on anything.

,personalfinance,"I know there are multiple posts about this and an entry in the Wiki, and I've read them, but I'm still not sure what the best option is. Consequently, I've created this throwaway -- in order to be quite specific about my financial details -- in hopes of getting a more clear answer.

I make $120,000/yr pre-tax, and my employer contributes 10% of my annual salary to a traditional 401k on my behalf each year. I currently max my yearly contribution limits into a Roth 401k (separate from my employer contributions, which as I understand, do not count toward my limits).

My wife makes about $40,000/yr pre-tax as a public school teacher. She thus contributes to a fixed-benefits pension and additionally contributes $12,000/yr into a 457(b). 

We both max our yearly Roth IRA contributions ($6000 each).

We are thus currently at the very high end of the 22% tax bracket, and likely to break into the low end of the 24% tax bracket in the next few years, and so the extra AGI adjustment from deducting retirement investments is unlikely to do too much there. 

Until now, I have been operating under the assumption that it's not a bad idea to invest into a Roth 401k until I'm in my 40s, at which point I thought I might switch, but doing some research more recently, I've found that it's often recommended to go for a traditional 401k when you're in a higher income tax bracket.

&lt;p&gt;Until now, I have been operating under the assumption that it&amp;#39;s not a bad idea to invest into a Roth 401k until I&amp;#39;m in my 40s, at which point I thought I might switch, but doing some research more recently, I&amp;#39;ve found that it&amp;#39;s often recommended to go for a traditional 401k when you&amp;#39;re in a higher income tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you guys recommend? (Thanks in advance for any advice you have to offer.)&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"My company recently is offering a rather interesting Voluntary Separation Package due to COVID-19 and cost cutting. The package is:

- minimum of 45 weeks paid to all employees that take it - no matter how long you worked there.  
- 100% full prior year bonus
- 18 months employer subsidized medical coverage under cobra 
- 6 months outplacement assistance (initiate within 1 year)
- 100% vesting of retirement plans

The last day of service would be November 2nd so you practically are finishing out this year with a job. Which I think is a big factor when seeking next employment, hopefully economy will be better early 2021. 

If there is not enough participation in the package then they would result to involuntary layoffs which would be roughly 60% of the current offer’s value. 

I have been there for 6 years so based on the package I would be paid out 51 weeks of salary (almost a year) plus my bonus equal to the amount I received this past March. 

Things for me to consider:
I am in my late 20s with various security licenses that I feel like I could land a job fairly easily. Ironically I have been interviewing outside with a company already that I think I would be getting an offer but they are waiting for their building to open back up versus start me remote. But if their start date is earlier than probably October and then I would not get the package leaving early. 

I currently have one rental property with a long term tenant and I offer AirBnB on the other rooms. He lost his job at the beginning of covid but now has a new job. He is behind on rent 1 month but should be able to catch up now that he is employeed.

Just curious about this as I was researching about credit card extended warranties. Basically let's say you bought an expensive computer for example $10k, but realized you didn't use the correct credit card. In this case, I don't know if the seller would refund the CC and put it on another card, but let's say it's via Amazon.

In this case, is it possible to list the item in an auction website as a seller and then buy it yourself as a buyer to charge to the CC that you want this charge to be on, so that when/if something happens to the item down the road, you can use the last CC's extended warranty?

Is this possible? Do CC insurance companies thoroughly check serials, manufacturer website's actual purchase dates, recorded dates, etc?

If I am not wrong, if you didn't register the computer, there is no way to know, so just showing the receipt from the auction website should show that you exceeded the manufacturer's warranty, no?

Because I see that some credit cards outright exclude computers, and some others include them as well as auction websites like ebay. Any ideas on this issue?

Throwaway because I don't want people knowing my main's financial stuff. TL;DR at the end.

~Prelude
So, recently (as in *immediately* before the COVID outbreak in the US), I broke down and finally purchased a house, because I was getting tired of rental problems. After searching for a couple (6+ months), and getting financed at a decent at the time (3.65%) rate, I found a house I wanted (HUD @ 136k), submitted a reno list (part of a 203(k), the ""official"" estimates came in around 30k, had to set aside some for inspections and stuff and I had to slush a percentage, so let's call it an even 175k). Wasn't a terrible deal overall, because it immediately appraised at 200k, even before the renovations. The contractor is a personal friend of mine, so we came in *well* under budget. Like, total costs were 16k out of 30k. Doesn't help that we had to use HUD guidelines for prices, which are absurd. Bank didn't like that, so with the HUD consultant's help (which is a necessary evil in these kinds of projects), we submitted some documents that take the full loan amount out and I get a check for the balance (14k).

~Info on my debts
For the down payment, I took out an FHA loan, and borrowed some money from my 401(k), which I contribute fully to every year. This loan is almost paid off, and has no interest rate.

For a while, i wasn't great at finances, and I'm trying to get better. Had a while where I had to credit card, with no emergency fund. I owe approximately 12k on them, the interest rates are fairly high (22.99% - they're both cash back cards)

I've been paying on my student loans, slowly but grinding them down. I currently owe about 16k (6.8% interest rate) on them total.

I'm leaning towards paying off the credit cards and throwing the balance on the student loans. Is this the right idea? Or should I pay a chunk of the CCs off (maybe down around 20-25%) and put the balance on the student loan?

TL;DR: 203(k) loan (175k @ 3.65%) was botched due to nepotism, so I got money (14k) back from it. Put it back on the house, pay off the CCs (12k @ 22.99%), pay off the student loans (16k @ 6.8%), pay back the 401k loan( almost done - less than 6 payments left, 0%), or some combination?

I'm 31, working a low-mid level job in government making 61k in the DC area, with a hopeful promotion (fingers crossed) up to 75k after I hit the 1-year mark, and future promotions/job opportunities that I'll look for in the years ahead.  

Sometimes I get down on myself because I feel like I'm behind where I should be at 31-- income wise and savings wise.  Thankfully I have little debt (2k left in student loans, and I pay my credit card off every month) but I only got this 61k job recently, after being at 30k-52k for 5 years.  In that time, it was difficult to really save any money.

So here I am-- $2500 to my name, throwing 20% of my income into my savings account to generate an emergency fund, contributing the maximum I can for government to max my TSP (401k equivalent), and shooting for more career growth.  Once I have my emergency fund built, I'd like to start saving for a downpayment on a house and/or contributing to a Roth IRA. 

I know that I'm on an upward trajectory, but I can't help but look at just how much a condo/house would cost in the areas in-and-around DC that I'm looking at.  On the low end of what I'd love to have, we're talking 700k condos. I feel like it's going to take 10-15 years to save up enough for a down payment, let alone the 30-year mortgage that would follow.  Granted, I'm basing that off my 61k income and not the 100k+ I'd like to earn in a higher government position, so I know things will speed up.

Anyway-- I dont know quite what I'm looking for here on PF.  Maybe I'm just looking to validation that I'm thinking about things the right way, or maybe I'm trying to get a reality check that I'm not ready to start thinking about this stuff?  Any feedback is welcome.  

(Also worth noting-- I'm currently single and planning my finances as if I will be single.

,personalfinance,"I'm currently graduating college with a humanities BA and some computer science work experience. My total student loan debt is 45k across 4 loans (most of which was the university forcing aid onto me, so I couldn't not take it to get other financial benefits), with an average interest rate of 3.2%. Currently the only gainful employment I have is freelance work, some web development here and there, and the potential to work with a company doing online media work for around 30k a year's contract.

Reality of the situation is that I don't make a lot, and due to physical limitations the place where I will be living is virtually inaccessible to me. The average wage is $10/hr, $40,000 a year if you're lucky (more normally $20,000), but the cost of going to and from places in Uber is routinely $40 one way. The math just doesn't add up. So I'm functionally stuck at home, even if our little Beer Virus friend wasn't keeping us all inside anyway. 

I have around 3.5k in bonds that are from the early 2000s that I can probably cash out or sell to cover 2 or 2.5k of the loans in the first year. Currently I make payments of around $100/mo when Sallie Mae sends emails saying I owe only something like $50, so at present I'm at least giving more than what is required to be paid. I know long term this isn't at all sustainable, though, hence why I'm considering looking abroad for work. 

The way the math seems to work out, if I can work in China or even a place like Vietnam teaching English for a year or two, I'll have earned a decent chunk of money coming in to where I can pay the loans off in 9 years or less. Most positions in China pay 2.5k USD/mo, with friends telling me they can easily live off of $1000/mo.. so after taxes throwing 800/mo at my loans doesn't seem unfeasible. 

At home my prospects seem very very slim. I'm not in an area that has a lot of tech/programming jobs, nor anything related to my BA, and I feel as though it will be a death sentence to go home and not do anything with my life, to be dependent on my parents because they retired in a rural area and I can't drive. For the time being I feel as though earning $2,000/mo (or even $1200 in a place like Vietnam) wouldn't be that bad of a situation combined with or even without my online work.

Now that I'm older and interested in making wiser financial decisions I'm looking at this and questioning the validity in keeping it. I am behind but recently got my Roth IRA Target Fund 2060 started and maxed it out for the year. I am currently unemployed and penny pinching, trying my best to make best decision with what dollars I have now for the future.

Obviously if I die I want my parents to be beneficiary of something. I can name them on my Roth IRA or maybe create a term life?

My question is this--&gt; I'm apparently *that* more or less ""deep"" into this Metlife policy. Should I liquidate what little cash value I can get out of it and dump that into my ROTH for 2019 or should I /my parents keep paying into this?

The whole concept of it confuses me. I know my parents wanted what's best as an investment for me and I'm not sure the Metlife plan, specifically, is it. But I also don't want to foolishly dump something I shouldn't. I have read much on here that these plans are gimicky at best, but not always. Not sure where I fall. Help me educate please.

I know this is for advice only, curious to hear back. TIA!",t2_144adj,False,,0,False,Should I keep this Metlife whole life insurance policy my parents set up for me in 1995?

Hello,

Title sums it up. In my late 20's I had property, an investment portfolio, luxury hybrid, six figure income, savings, etc. I fell in love and moved to the EU. I didn't realize the person was so terrible with finances and his family continued to uphold his delusional bubble. The best I got out of his Sister when confronting her about knowing he was lying to me about finances was that it was because ""he loves you"". Cue the profanity.

Long story short, in the decade during the relationship I got lost. I had to sell my property, I lost my career growth and thus income earning and gains, and the country I am in (Netherlands) has limited financial services for US citizens. In the years that I was focusing on raising the kids, the Fathers retirement was meant to be for both of us, so I did not set up anything here on my own. I get very little from the Father, but have been able to save a little over the past couple of years. I need to make it work for me ASAP. I know what I used to do, but I was on a great path with property and earning compounded interest. Now I need to try and patch this up as soon as possible. It would be nice to be able to have the children still enjoy small local holiday's and such, but I recognize that the main priority now needs to be rebuilding my finances. Their Father earns very well, but is terrible with money, so he is paycheck/paycheck, behind on child support, and has debt of his own. I know he doesn't have any savings for them. I have a secondary goal of building a trust for them, in case something happens to me, so that they can afford to go and see their Family overseas annually.

I am open to any advice. I am very interested if anyone can advise on what is best with the dual residency issue and financial services available given the surface level restrictions. I don't know if I should set up a 529 (US College Savings Account/Program) for the kids, even tho it is likely they end up going to university here in the EU...

I got myself into some financial trouble last year and racked up some pretty bad credit card debt.  Here’s a run down of all of it. 

19k ~18% interest
10.5k ~17% interest (a personal loan)
7.5k ~8% (a personal loan)
4k ~0% (promotional apr for the next year)
1700 ~ 16% interest rate

Right now I still have about 29 years left on the mortgage so restarting the 30 year process doesn’t really bother me. 
I owe about 374.9k on the mortgage still. Refinancing would add an additional ~$12k to the principle while reducing the interest rate from 4% to 2.875. This would lower my monthly payment by ~$210 a month and save $75k over the life of the loan.  Dropping the monthly payment on the house also allows me the opportunity to rent out the house without breaking even every month. 

The loan officer also says I would receive roughly 3k from my escrow and defer a monthly payment. Basically allowing me to use 5k to go straight to my debt. 


It sounds like a no brainer when the Loan officer explained it to me, but I’m trying to gather more information before I jump the gun. 

Pros:
$200 off my monthly payments (75k overall)
~$5k towards debt

Cons:

&lt;p&gt;Right now I still have about 29 years left on the mortgage so restarting the 30 year process doesn’t really bother me. 
I owe about 374.9k on the mortgage still. Refinancing would add an additional ~$12k to the principle while reducing the interest rate from 4% to 2.875. This would lower my monthly payment by ~$210 a month and save $75k over the life of the loan.  Dropping the monthly payment on the house also allows me the opportunity to rent out the house without breaking even every month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loan officer also says I would receive roughly 3k from my escrow and defer a monthly payment. Basically allowing me to use 5k to go straight to my debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a no brainer when the Loan officer explained it to me, but I’m trying to gather more information before I jump the gun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:
$200 off my monthly payments (75k overall)
~$5k towards debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:
~12k added to my principle and another year added to my mortgage&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"I've noticed people occasionally asking how to add cash to online bank accounts when they don't have a brick and mortar bank to deposit cash for a transfer.  Also some online banks require you to link another bank account when you sign up just to make the first deposit. 

I just opened an Ally online bank account and I linked it to my BlueBird prepaid card. BlueBird is one of the best prepaid cards because it has almost no fees. It has no monthly fees and no fees to add cash at a Walmart. So that's how I put cash into my Ally account. I go to Walmart, deposit cash (no fee) onto my BB card and then just transfer the cash to my Ally Bank account. It's easy and cost nothing.

Note 1: The first time you'll need to link your accounts and this does take a few days for the banks to verify each other. First you use your online bank site to link to BB with the routing and bank numbers. 

Linking the other way is a little tricky because BB doesn't offer the option on its app. You have to use the regular BB online or mobile site and find the right links. 

First go to the BlueBird regular *online site* (not the app). 

When you get to the BB site click the three dashes on the top right corner. Then click ""settings"" and then  ""withdraw funds"" and then ""transfer to bank."" 

Note 2: It does take 2-5 days for money transfers after the initial set up.

,personalfinance,"Hi all!

Situation as follows:

 * $15k in CC debt, 20% APR

 * $4k in vested stock options that I have 90 days to purchase or relinquish

 * $12k in a 401k, option to pull out without a penalty due to COVID-19

Partner and I have shared finances. Currently awkwardly balancing my joining a (funded) grad program this fall, and their finishing med school this spring. By the time they start residency, our emergency fund will be down to ~$4k, and we'll then be ~$2k net positive per month, with the plan to dump that straight into med school student loans to keep interest down until I graduate and they finish residency.

Stock options aren't a sure thing - the start-up has a good runway and high valuation, but the next round will be led by a sovereign fund, which makes me skeptical that there will be any liquidity in the near future. 

My current plan is to pull from the 401k to pay off the majority of the CC debt since CC APR % &gt; stock market return %, and see if the company will buy back a portion of the vested shares and use that money to cover the purchase of the rest.

Am I missing anything obvious here? Should I try and refinance the CC debt before pulling from the 401k? Should I just try and sell all my vested options back to the company?

,personalfinance,"I am a 26 year old, I am not sure if that information is relevant.

Last month I applied and was approved for a Chase Freedom Credit Card. My line is $1500. The only reason I got the card was because I thought it would help boost my credit score, because it would dip about 30 points on and off after my student loans were paid off.

I am debt-free and paid off all my student loans in 2018. My score was around 720-730 and then dropped to around 680s before settling into 700s since then. However, I was not very good with my student loans - I had 6 loans and they were all delinquent (over 90 days late). I know that is not good, but I didn't know any better. I wanted to pay them off slowly, but because of personal reasons had to pay them all off at once.

I understand that in 7 years those 6 delinquencies may drop, but before then what can I do to make the score higher? I want to buy a house sometime in 2021 or 2022 and am afraid of getting a bad ""deal"" because of a bad credit score.

I am not as knowledgeable as I want to be when it comes to finance things (I am still learning and know MUCH MORE than two months ago), so what should I do?

Based on Credit Karma:

I have 6 closed accounts (1 open, is that the cc?), 1 hard inquiry (for cc), a 13 year old account (I have an account with my parent and they authorized me as a person on their cc and it has no late payments... however, I have not used that cc since 2014, should I ask them to take me off of it? I was also thinking of closing that account with them and opening my own bank account, is that a smart idea?), 0 derogatory marks, 100% payment history, 4% credit use of $20 on a $500 line... but I don't know what line that is?

Hi there! Currently I'm working full time making about $2200 a month while living at home. My main goal has been to increase my income but I am wondering how you would split up your savings in my position.

I have been aiming to save 800 per paycheck and have built and emergency fund of $5000. I was wondering how would you split up your savings? My plan so far has been, 400-500 per paycheck in VEQT, 200-300 for either building emergency fund more or saving for something like travel and the rest for misc expenses like bills and food.

I'm seeing if I am able to increase my income without school, so the only big expense I can see myself going into in the future is potentially a business, but have no plans of one in the immediate future.

I don't plan on moving out for a few years at least while I plan what I want to do for the future.

My job appears to be secure as sales have been meeting goals during the pandemic. As for growth, I work  at a  dealership so If I can improve sales I can leverage for a raise

Short term I'm looking to self teach coding and and other valuable skills in order to increase my income. Long term  I could see myself renting my own place.

I've been stuck between going for a degree and choosing to pursue a career without one.

Any and all advice or tips appreciated!

,personalfinance,"Hello everyone, I know I should've done this sooner but oh well.

Some context: I'm a 22 year old university student and I live in Colombia so I guess everyone here can't do much to help me out with this, but I've read that there are some international rules that every bank must follow depending on the card brand, so maybe someone has those rules clear and can tell me if I can do something or not.

All of this started on October 3 2018. It was 8 pm and I was coming home from university in a bus, after I got on my stop, a guy basically kidnapped me for two hours threatening me with torturing/murdering me if I didn't do what he asked me to do. So I had to hand him my two credit cards, a VISA and a MasterCard that were offered to me because I was using my first credit card (the MasterCard one) responsibly, the VISA one had a topping of around 1000 USD at the time. 

The thing is, I hadn't used that card ever, I hadn't even activated it after receiving it from the mail, but the bank had a part in the contract for the card that said that it would be activated automatically after delivery if I signed the contract. Well, I had obviously signed the contract because I wasn't worried about it, I was thinking about having a good credit score in the future just using the cards responsibly, until I got kidnapped.   

So, after a lot of drama I managed to get out but I couldn't even file a police report (a great mistake, I didn't knew better then and my dad that studied Law didn't cared about reporting the crime thinking it would be useless, the worst part was that one of the band that kidnapped me was caught, but oh well), I blocked my cards and went to sleep. The next day I noticed that there were 5 charges to my VISA card that maxed the card, so I reported it to the bank and they said they couldn't do anything; even though I wasn't present, my card wasn't signed and the receipt of the purchase was never signed, the place where the purchases were made didn't check the customer's identity, the equivalent of my SSN was never compromised, and there were no evidence about the purchases being made other than what the bank reported to me. I'm pretty sure about this information because the bank itself confirmed it.

,personalfinance,"Long story short, my Mom was awarded a backdated disability coverage from her time in the reserves where she was injured. There is a large, tax-free lump sum of money (~140K, the backdated) along with monthly stipends for the rest of her life (~4,000 or so with residuals). She will soon qualify for social security as well. She only works part-time and has for many years now. Her savings are low and she has no investments. On the bright side, she has no debt and lives incredibly cost-conscious. Her only expenses are rent (TBD since she is moving), food, utilities, and entertainment. She has asked me for her help in navigating her finances towards smart decisions.

,personalfinance,"Hi Reddit!  I need a bit of help here.

back probably 8 or 9 years ago in my college days I had a terrible experience with Bank of America overdrafting my overdrafted overdraft and freezing my checking account.  I had a credit card tied to it  and was so frustrated with the whole situation I told them to kick rocks and they would never get a dime from me.  about a year later had a similar experience with American Express.   (2 accounts went to collections, I never paid etc.)

Fast forward to today, the only debt I have is a 20k student loan that has spotless payments, other cards are constantly paid down to 0 with no missed payments in forever.  I'm looking at getting a house now, and when talking to the mortgage company was told it would be tough due to ""2 bad marks"" and they suggested I try and settle the old debts.  I was under the impression they were so old they wouldn't matter?

When looking online about settled debt a lot of people say it's detrimental to your credit.  I know its not perfect but Credit Karma says i'm at a 744 credit score.  I am debating going to my Credit Union that I bank with to apply for a home loan but I'm worried the past debts will be an issue.

,personalfinance,"Hi Reddit — So the backstory.

During January I traveled to Las Vegas for a professional conference with work. Spent a week there all in all.. First few days were fine, very productive in fact, and met a ton of folk from all over the world. 

Fast forward to day four and I get a severe stomach bug while wrapping up the exhibition for that days outing. Sparing details, I retired to my hotel room for the evening and ingested liquids, had some plain food, etc. hoping that by morning it would pass and I could stay the course for the following day. I am able to get a few hours of rest and then *BOOM* I wake up feeling extremely dehydrated accompanied by body shakes, nausea, and lots of dizziness and confusion when trying to process. I attempt to figure out the best solution to the situation without panicking for a while. Bear in mind, I am in an unusual place at 1:30AM, so I ended up making the decision to call a taxi and head to the nearest hospital to get checked out for safe measure.

Fast forward to the waiting room at the Valley Hospital Medical Center and intake procedure – vitals come back generally okay, but they decide to run some blood work and pop an IV in to revive my shaken state and double check things in an attempt to validate why I am feeling so crumby. A comprehensive panel and a bag of fluid later and I’m being discharged with a sigh of relief and an Rx for Imodium (lol).

Upon checkout they let me know I could self pay for the sum of $783. Me being tired (3:30AMish now) and them not having processed my entire visit, I thought it to be wise to let insurance have a look.

A few weeks go by and then I get my EOB from Cigna. EIGHT THOUSAND and change dollars the hospital billed for this simple procedure. Sure, I went to the ER, but my jaw dropped. Now, they classified my visit as severe on my intake paperwork and I have already tried arguing this point with the billing department explaining I ordered a taxi, walked up to the counter and proceeded to have a full blown conversation with the kind aide checking my vitals on why she loved her VW Jetta. I’d say this is a grotesque overstatement. Anyhow, they’ve stuck with this. I’ve asked for a itemized list of all charges and have yet to receive said breakdown.

My deductible is $2,800 (in-network, which this hospital is for me) and I have an out-of-pocket maximum of $3,800. Based on how the hospital billed the insurance, they’ve basically negotiated with my insurance company for seemingly a maximum. My owed amount is $2,770.

I have already requested a charity application from the hospital, filled and sent, and USPS is telling me today the hospital is either not accepting mail or is refusing my post containing my charity application / requested documentation. I have submitted my charity application via email yesterday and have yet to receive confirmation of receipt. Billing staff say I have received my 60 day notice and it will be sent to a third party collections agency soon and “they highly recommend me to take on a payment plan.” I asked them if I paid in full, what discount would they offer. No dice as they explained “this is a deductible thing.”

Please help me to understand what options I have here (before we go down a one way street, filing bankruptcy protection is not a viable solution for me) and what would be the best course of action. Frankly, I’m shocked and appalled at how for profit our healthcare system is in the US based on this recent experience.

TL;DR: Visited hospital because I felt poor, received explanation of benefits in the amount of ~$8,000. Deductible brings this down to ~$3,000 for a blood test and IV via Emergency room. How can I resolve this expending the least amount possible?

&lt;p&gt;My sister moved away and doesn&amp;#39;t want to pay for taxes or anything anymore, but still owns the house with me.  I am thinking that if she wants to retain ownership she needs to continue to pay half the taxes. Please tell me if my scenarios seem reasonable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) She continues to pay 50% of the annual taxes, but since she does not use the house I will pay my half of the taxes, and all of the utilities and upkeep etc. This way she still has an equity stake in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) She can pay nothing, but will be entitled to 50% of the current value of the house and no longer have any affiliation with it (The means by which she would receive the $125k would have to be sorted out)&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"TLDR:  I have $20k left over from a home equity loan.  What should I do with it? Return it? Invest it? Or something else?

Background:  50 years old, married, empty nest (adult children have moved out).  Purchased home for cash 5 years ago.  Spent the last 5 years working on it a bit at a time.  Got tired of how long it was taking.  

In February 2020 I got a home equity loan for $80k at 4% over 15 years.  Should be paid off by the time I can retire at 65.  

Spent $60k of the $80k loan paying off all other debt and making improvements to the house.  At the time (pre-coronavirus) the house was appraised for $160k, so loan was roughly 50% of equity.  (Now Zillow says it's around $145k, which doesn't include improvements.)

After paying off credit cards, my credit score went from 641 to between 730-760 depending on which agency you ask.  I've since applied for additional credit cards.  Got one from Chase with a $11k limit.  A few other cards raised my limit, when asked.  I now have $31,750 in available credit with none of it used.  Two cars are paid off.  My only debt is the $80k for the mortgage.

After clearing all debt and completing all planned upgrades to the house (windows, kitchen, appliances, flooring, etc.) I have $20k left over.  (I didn't budget for this, I just asked for $80k and received it.)  

So what do I do with the remaining $20k?

Do I repay it back to the mortgage company towards the principal?

Do I put it in savings?  The best savings accounts I can find are only 1.5% while the loan is 4%, so that doesn't make sense.

Do I invest it in stocks?  I see a bunch of long-time companies, like Disney and United, whose stock prices are at the lowest they've been in several years.  Do I invest it in those and hope they return to pre-coronovirus levels in the next 3 to 5 years and double my money?

Is there some other investment opportunity I should explore?

Do I blow it on booze and strippers?  Cuz I'm leaning towards blowing it on booze and strippers.

Background:
My parents pulled all my money (around 2k) from my student bank account last year claiming that it would be harmful for college financial aid calculations, and I haven’t had access to anything since (although I haven’t had access to anything before due to being a minor).

- Would I be able to walk into a bank by myself and set up my own account and credit card? (I’d wait until I got on campus because I’d want to use a chain that’s easily accessible.)

,personalfinance,"I got a job offer for a highly technical scientist position in Silicon Valley in a new career I have no previous experience in but loosely related to my PhD. I already live in the area so I understand the high cost of living and I lead a frugal life that I enjoy. I got hired for a position that required a PhD and 2 years of experience (or a B.S with 10 years of experience). I was asked what my expected salary would be. I did my research, but this job had a wide salary range and I know people in academia that do similar things as lab managers for 45k a year.

  


I said I would be okay with a salary in the high 5 figures range, but the recruiter said the range was 5k higher than what I suggested. My question is, how much did I screw myself over? I feel like I low-balled myself. I'm excited about the job, and the salary is a lot more than what I am making now. But I was a postdoc and therefore making no money relative to my education level, so it's not hard to do better ""in my field"".

I already live in the area so I understand the high cost of living and I lead a frugal life that I enjoy. I got hired for a position that required a PhD and 2 years of experience (or a B.S with 10 years of experience). I was asked what my expected salary would be. I did my research, but this job had a wide salary range and I know people in academia that do similar things as lab managers for 45k a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I would be okay with a salary in the high 5 figures range, but the recruiter said the range was 5k higher than what I suggested. My question is, how much did I screw myself over? I feel like I low-balled myself. I&amp;#39;m excited about the job, and the salary is a lot more than what I am making now. But I was a postdoc and therefore making no money relative to my education level, so it&amp;#39;s not hard to do better &amp;quot;in my field&amp;quot;.

,personalfinance,"As of this past year, my partner uses a wheelchair for a degenerative neurological disease. In December, using his CapitalOne Quicksilver Visa card, we purchased a powered wheelchair online from a small company that was supposed to be amazing for getting around our home city. It was expensive, about $4,600, but would have been worth it for him to have more independence. We were super excited that he could finally walk the dog on his own again or go around the block without help for the first time in a year!

Unfortunately, the wheelchair as it arrived was faulty -- some crucial parts were poorly constructed, with the result that it was impossible to turn on and off and therefore completely useless to anyone needing a wheelchair. On top of that, it was clearly a REALLY dangerous device, not at all okay for anyone to ride safely. When my partner tried using it the first time, the wheelchair skidded around uncontrollably and erratically with a huge amount of force. My partner was literally thrown backwards out of the chair, heels over head, and would have been really seriously injured if he hadn’t been wearing a helmet -- as it was, he had serious bruising from the impact. The wheelchair then spun out of control and hit me, leaving me bruised for weeks. We had skid marks on our floor, and it nearly broke through our apartment windows! Suffice to say this was a super sketchy product, not safe for ANYONE, let alone someone with limited mobility who can’t jump out quickly. 

We then immediately tried to return the wheelchair. Now, according to EU consumer law, any product bought online can be returned for any reason within the first few weeks, AND also products must be refunded or repaired if found faulty in the first two years (with return shipping). The seller also has a return/warranty policy that guarantees against product faults and includes free return shipping. However, when we contacted the seller about needing a return, we got complete radio silence...first sketchy feelings that we got that maybe this was a scam :/ After trying over and over to get a response, we eventually shipped the wheelchair back ourselves ($250 shipping, it was heavy!), and filed a chargeback request with CapitalOne.

CapitalOne initially ruled in our favor after presenting the pictures, return shipping, etc., but last month suddenly reversed the charge because of a technicality. They claim that because we filed the chargeback *before* shipping the item back, it’s invalid -- though they never mentioned this originally. The same people also advised us to hold on to the original item and request an independent mechanic validate that it was faulty and dangerous, so we got totally contradicting info when filing the chargeback. The only reason we delayed shipping the item back was because it was pretty expensive, and according to both the seller’s policy and EU law, the seller was required to cover it.

So now the seller has both the wheelchair back AND our money, and CapitalOne and Visa aren’t following through on their purchase protection program. :/

This whole situation is especially awful given that the item in question is a wheelchair, of all things, and we’ve already had super high medical bills this year. It’s not an optional expense, and while we’ve been back and forth with the credit card company for months we’ve had to purchase another wheelchair for my partner to use. It doesn’t make sense that we no longer even have the item and don’t have the cash either. What do folks recommend we do in this case?

So, strangers of reddit, anyone else who's been married abroad mind sharing their costs? Anything to think about specifically that you wish you had put more thought into before? Anything you wish you added to the ""package"" or something you wish you planned separately for? 

We do not plan to pay for airfare for guests, and plan to have 2-3 events with a party bus before and after the wedding, allowing for everyone to do their own thing if they wish.

&lt;p&gt;So, strangers of reddit, anyone else who&amp;#39;s been married abroad mind sharing their costs? Anything to think about specifically that you wish you had put more thought into before? Anything you wish you added to the &amp;quot;package&amp;quot; or something you wish you planned separately for? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not plan to pay for airfare for guests, and plan to have 2-3 events with a party bus before and after the wedding, allowing for everyone to do their own thing if they wish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: We like Europe, visited Prague, Munich, Salzburg, and love the vibe of the area and the ability to do things we normally wouldn&amp;#39;t get to do in the NYC metro area. And we understand a destination trip is a big commitment, we intend to have people decline; that&amp;#39;s sort of the point as well, to save money on the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit2: this is a budgeting exercise, people. This isn&amp;#39;t a near term thing (read: will probably happen ~2023), so please leave COVID out of it. I haven&amp;#39;t even proposed yet. And as for everyone saying &amp;quot;OMG huge inconvenience&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s sort of the point. We want to reduce costs at home, have a vacation while we&amp;#39;re at it, and celebrate our wedding with those willing to make the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

,personalfinance,"Hi there! I have a question for a friend who is not, in fact, me.

My friend works for a company that offers RSUs as part of his compensation. Let’s say he makes 90k as his base compensation but his RSUs are worth roughly 20k right now. These RSUs vest on the 31st of January each year and will be worth, at that time, whatever 200 RSUs are worth from the company.

We were chatting when he had a question about whether he should take out half his RSUs this year and pay off a credit card debt of 10k.

I know as his RSUs vest they’re included on his W2, but when he had his taxes done for 2019 he had been advised that since he sells the stock before he has had them for a year, he is taxed higher on them, but if he waits a year he can cash them out for capital gains instead, which is a difference of 24% because he’ll have less than 40k total in capital gains.

I went on investopedia to try to figure this out, since to me that sounds like he’d be double taxed, but I couldn’t figure out what we were even looking for, though I did read the entire article on RSUs and Capital Gains as well as looking at what tax bracket he’d be in. I did ask the guy who did his taxes but he was high and playing Smash, so I encountered some miscommunication.

Anyway, the core of the question is “is it worth it to save 15% APR on a 10k credit card balance by cashing out RSUs that vested January 31st this year?”

,personalfinance,"I'm about to refinance from a 3.75% 15 year loan on a house I bought last March.  I locked in a pretty good rate last Friday of 15 years at 2.375% (2.788% APR with points etc.).  I didn't realize at the time that the rate was assuming I would set up an escrow account.  I currently do not have escrow account and just pay taxes/insurance once a year on my own.  I tried to see if they would just remove the escrow from my loan and they said they can do this but it would increase my locked in rate to 2.5%(2.836% apr).  They apparently allow me to change to any type of loan on the day I locked in but for whatever reason the rates are higher without escrow.

I would prefer the lower rate, but I honestly don't fully understand how escrow works.  I know that I have to pre-fund the account to cover taxes/insurance so there is an upfront cost for that.  Also, I will have to pay extra each month to essentially cover the taxes/insurances costs divided by 12 instead of paying it in full once per year.

From what I understand, the big penalty of an escrow account is the fact that I have to leave a decent chunk (maybe 3k in my case) locked up in this account that probably doesn't pay me any interest.

Looking at the credit report, I saw that my lines of credit were two lines of credit that my father has in his name. My credit history goes back almost 26 years now. I’m 22. 


     While I am absolutely psyched about having such a high credit score (and do pay all of my personal bills on time, etc) I can’t do anything with it. I have some kind of freeze or lock on my credit. I couldn’t even get a phone line with AT&amp;T with a $250 down payment on an $700 phone. My own credit union won’t approve me for even a $1000 loan. At all. Not even with a stupid high APR. Every time I try to do anything even remotely concerning my credit, I’m either instantly denied, or they ask me a series of insane questions (what street addresses I’ve ever been associated with, what cars have been in my name, what phone numbers I’ve had) and the answer for me to all of them, as an adult, is none of the above. They’re all either questions of places we lived when I was basically an infant, or questions about places my parents lived before I was even born. I’ve checked experian to see if there’s a lock on my credit through them, and saw nothing. I can’t even make an account with equifax or view anything through them because of the questions and asking me about auto loans in my name in 2014 and who I took the loan out from  (when I was 16, definitely didn’t have an auto loan) and how much my monthly payments were on that. They even asked me about a personal loan from a jeweler from 2015? Which I very much did not have? 


     I just don’t know where to begin on trying to fix this. I’ve finally gotten to the point where I am almost 100% independent from my father (which took years of effort on separating all my stuff from him and finally just moving out, grabbing as much stuff as I could fit in the car and just leaving and getting a new phone plan) or so I thought, and now it feels like he can still basically control my whole life because I can’t even access my accounts to see if he’s locked or frozen my credit. I don’t know who to call, or how to even verify my identity considering that’s the purpose of those questions. I didn’t do any of this and feel extremely violated and upset at the fact that I can’t even take out a student credit card with a $200 limit in my name because of the lock or freeze on my credit that I didn’t put on there. I also know of at least one savings account that he has with my name as the primary account holder that I have zero access too, and I am highly motivated to believe that there is another account in the form of a trust that my grandfather started for me that my father has lied to me about that is also in my name (according to a letter I received from the bank asking for consent to insure my trust and my mother asking me why I didn’t already know about it when I called and asked her because my father wouldn’t tell me anything about it). 


     I believe this is actually a case of parent child identity theft just in a really weird scenario of improving and building my credit score but still doing things to my accounts without my consent. Is there anything I can do or anyone I can call? Should I just call a lawyer at this point? I feel overwhelmed about the idea of not being able to access my own accounts and being able to see what’s in my own name due to him locking everything and refusing to tell me anything.

Resolved: These were a series of adjustments because the company was making estimated contributions while I was employed

====

I left my previous employer over a year ago, and rolled over my 401k into a combination of Traditional &amp; Roth IRA's. Later I found that a small company contribution (\~ $180) was made to my 401k about 6 months after I left.

Now I have discovered that 2 more company match contributions (totaling \~ $750) have been made to the same 401k.

Are these strange contributions going to create tax / legal problems for me (I maxed out my 2019 401k contributions, and intend to max out the 2020 contributions as well)?  What can I do to right the situation?

,personalfinance,"I would like to ""own"" a car, for, say one year. I live in Manhattan, NYC where parking + insurance are very expensive, I haven't ever had a car (hence the high insurance) but I've made the decision to get one for around a year for better commuting during coronavirus times, weekend getaways, taking some short road trips, etc.

If it were permanent, obviously I'd just buy one, but I expect my situation to change so I want to plan around one year.

I'm weighing up these options:

* Taking a one year lease transfer through leasetrader / swapalease. There are some appealing options at around $400/month, &gt; 1000 miles / month. Being under warranty with minimal servicing and a fixed end date is appealing, with this option all the costs are more or less fixed and predictable, but there are some transfer and lease end fees in addition to the monthly that all start to add up.
* Buying a used car in good condition and selling again after a year. This is appealing because it might be a little cheaper than leasing, and there's more flexibility around the end date and mileage, for what that's worth. On the other hand, I am concerned about being on the hook for any major mechanical repairs. I am also very concerned about the disposal part of transaction - where I am, my parking + insurance is around $600/month, so I wouldn't want to be paying that while I am looking for a buyer, or alternatively having to take a low-ball offer / trade-in from a dealer. If I had some dealer / mechanic / service I trusted to help with these aspects it could work, but I don't. I'm honestly not even sure what I should expect my ballpark loss should be to buy and then resell a $20k-ish car after a year through carvana or some local dealer.
* Rolling one-month rentals from Avis / Hertz / etc. I'm doing this now, and I've done it in the past for a 6 month stretch. It's actually pretty good, you get a decent rate for 1 month stints, totally all-in (servicing, tires, cleaning), and I have a corporate discount that gets it pretty low. The downside is that you don't get a particularly great car, the price might shoot up at some point, and visiting the rental office for the change-overs and changing the tag with the garages I park at is a bit tedious.

I'm basically leaning towards the 1-year lease transfer. I don't really expect it to be too much less than the rolling one-month leases, but I can choose a nicer car and not worry about swapping it during the year.

,personalfinance,"Hello all

I’m weighing my options and am looking into buying a home.  Based on my situation it’s probably not likely but I like to weigh my options and this particular situation is not a topic I have found much info for, which is why I’m asking for your advice even though it’s not probable. 

About me:
37 y/o, single no kids
NYC metro area
$100-120k annual income
825 credit score
Stable income even in this current and foreseeable COVID environment
Rent 1100, car 400 per month
Currently about 20k in savings but projected to have about 50k conservatively based on current trends 
401k w/ 100% match up to 6% plus 6k in Roth IRA, $3500 HSA per year

Looking at homes for 450-500k and would have about 50k down, to purchase early to mid 2021

So since I’m not going to have enough for 20% down, I know I’ll have to pay PMI in this situation.  With that considered, I am still somewhat interested because I want to settle down and own my home. And with the way home prices have been going up since my adulthood, I feel like next year or thereabouts will be a good opportunity. 

Would you recommend going ahead with my plan?  And why or why not?

,personalfinance,"**Summary:** Hoping for objective feedback on whether it is fiscally responsible for me to consider temporarily leaving the workforce to be a more present parent/teacher and improve my own mental health. Total income reduction would be \~40%.

I want to acknowledge from the start that I know we're very privileged to be able to consider this option. Also, our school district is known for being woefully underfunded and ill-prepared for anything outside of the ordinary, so unfortunately we just can't count on a plan that will actually be supportive of working parents. The resources we've been provided to date suggest a six-hour cobbled-together ""curriculum"" of websites, and as full-time working parents that's just not reasonable. Again, recognizing our privilege here and acknowledging that a lot of parents are dealing with the same thing and have no choice but to continue to muddle through.

**All the context:** I have been in my field for over a decade in a few different companies (never less than three years at any) and at increasing levels. I've built solid connections, and the field I'm in now is not in danger of decline. However, my current employer is in an at-risk industry, though in a growth niche of that industry and doing quite well before COVID-19. I work for HQ and have solid job security relative to other positions, but a month ago the company did lay off 25% of total HQ staff (including open positions) and us survivors took a 10% pay cut. The company is doing everything possible to stay relevant and grow revenue within current constraints, but due to the industry there is a lot out of anyone's control (so there's a fair chance more cuts are on the horizon, and work will continue to consolidate to those who remain).

I don't love what I do, but I'm good at it, am respected, and have curated valuable connections at different companies. However, with all the ambiguity of COVID-19 my job has become more stressful than ever. As the SME people depend on me for a lot, and the amount of requests and projects I'm being pulled into is excessive, but necessary. Meanwhile, I also have a young child in elementary school, and neither my spouse nor I have been able to devote enough time to effectively continuing his education beyond relying on Khan Academy and the like and doing a hands-on science experiments maybe once a week.

Given the high stress of my job, the marketability of my field, and the fact that school and childcare very likely won't be any kind of ""normal"" at least through the end of 2020, I'm seriously considering leaving my job and looking for something new next year. I could likely take an unpaid FMLA leave, but realistically I know that's not enough time, and I know I wouldn't want to return after taking time off.Pros to quitting: Dedicated time to spend with the kid, less stress for my spouse so he can more fully focus on work, head space for me to give some actual thought to whether I even want to continue in my field or pivot to something else, and greatly decreased stress.Cons: \~40% decrease in household income, potential difficulty re-entering job market, additional stress on my spouse being the ""breadwinner"". My spouse grew up lower-middle class and is nervous about the prospect of giving up my income.

,personalfinance,"Hello r/personalfinance, I am in my mid 20's and will soon be starting medical school this July. I chose the cheapest school I was accepted to which will cost about $50k in tuition/year. I should add that I have also found reasonable housing with a roommate for $500/month. I am very fortunate since my grandparents left me one of their investment properties which generates $700/month of profit but could be sold for $450k. (the amount left on the 30 yr mortgage is approximately 250k) 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, should I keep the property, live off the $700/month and take a federal direct unsubsidized loan at 6.08% with 1.059% fees to pay for tuition (50k/year)

or

should I sell the property, and use the money to fund medical school and living expenses for those 4 years. This would cause me to have no loans, but I lose out on $700/month for possibly a long time and the property possibly appreciating in value over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this information helps but the specialties I am interested in range anywhere from 300k to 400k salary per year and require 3-4 years of residency following medical school where I would be making \~50k.

,personalfinance,"Recently I decided to be more adult and be more aggressive about improving my credit. I got an account at myfico.com and was really surprised to see my credit score dropped nearly 100 points in the past year. Although I haven't been good at monitoring my credit, I'm very good at paying my bills on time, saving, and investing. So it was a shock to see my credit score that once was around 775 is sitting at 689.  After looking into my official credit report (Experian) I have a bank account that is ""Charged Off""!  Impossible I think to myself. I dig into it and what happen was I forgot an old bank account that I had been meaning to close was attached to my PayPal and I didn't realize it, this was about a year ago. At the time I realized I logged in to find a ton of NSF fees and I'm about $70 overwithdrawn. I transfer what money I had in the savings account ($5) to show I'm making progress in paying it and immediately set up a transfer from my primary bank account to cover the balance. About a week later it goes through and I pay off the overwithdrawn account and remove all connections to this account to avoid this in the future.  So fast forward to yesterday when I see this account is ""charged off"". I look into it and at the time of charge off it had a $0 balance. How do you charge off nothing?  


After looking into it, it looks like creditors have to wait 120 days to charge off an account and mine was only negative for 49 days. Does the 120 day wait not apply to banking accounts?  What is my recourse?  I know it was dumb to forget about a bank account, but it's equally dumb to have a HUGE ding to my credit for 7 years over a debt I paid during my legally allowed time frame.
