1,t3_ggfazw,investing,Non index funds that do well when the market is flat.,"I thought I’d try something a little different. Let’s have a thread for NON etf ideas for things that will do,well if the market goes nowhere.

I think there is a pretty explicit assumption that this sub is pretty bullish. If you’re not bullish, where would you put your money.

I’ve been looking into an interesting CEF. It’s called QQQX by Nuveen. It’s a covered call fund that sells calls on the NASDAQ. It’s survived 2008. My logic is that covered calls do really well in a flat to rising market and it does Ok is bear markets too. It’s has a similar performance to Spy if you reinvest dividends.

What other ideas do you guys have for alternative investments?"
2,t3_ggf7zk,investing,What profits should we expect for a company that comes first in the covid race for a vaccine?,"I'm new to investing and have no background in finances etc

For example I like moderna, and let's assume it comes first in the race and passes all the trials. And let's say it produces 1B vaccine in a year, what growth should I expect solely on the covid 19 thingy?

Moderna has a lot more vaccine in development and so if covid vaccine works out, it would be a huge boost for everything else.. I don't like it for solely covid-19 efforts.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I estimate a company stock growth if I believe that a specific company produces an approved vaccine?

For example

INO 10.86 market cap 1.58B

MRNA 59.25 market cap 19.49B

What prices should I expect for them or any other company that produces a viable and approved vaccine for covid? Should I expect moderna at $300? $1000? $200?

I just have no idea, I'm certain it will be 2x for any of them(not just these 2, I don't know who wins), but that's just my lowest possible estimate."

4,t3_ggedr4,investing,Group and company f/s and consolidated statements,"I can't seem to understand. The difference between group and company FS

Here's an example:

Main company (A) owns 60% of subsidiary X, 40% of subsidiary Y and 100% of subsidiary Z. Does that mean that the group statement such as balance sheet and income statement includes combination of A, X(60%), Y(40%) and  Z(100%)? 

And does that also mean that the company statements are for main company A only?

Also for ownership accounting, there are 3 way. Creating consolidated subsidiary FS, the cost method and the equity method. Is it right to say that consolidated subsidiary is the same as the group financial statements?"

6,t3_ggciv1,investing,IWM Leaps,"Leaps on IWM Small Cap ETF. I'm thinking Jan 2021 150c. Up 33% from open to close today alone. Now I personally wholly expect another IWM crash with unemployment as high as it is and supply chains disrupted like they are, but the truth is, we may be on the upward slope with the unprecedented Fed actions taking place. So the question becomes, wait for pullback? Or, get in now before you miss your opportunity? This Black Swan isn't going to last forever, and if you want guaranteed high returns for the upcoming year, I say Jan 2021 150c will get you there. Maybe the whole world is coming to an end. Maybe not. If it isn't, there is no way I see Jan 2021 150c not being a safe bet, depending upon your level of greed and willingness to take profits when you see them.

Currently, I'm 125p 5/15 and not feeling great unless the rug pulls Monday. And it might pull pretty well. But longterm, I can't imagine a more guaranteed, great investment than Leaps on IWM, the lifeblood of our economy. Do your own research on Small Cap recovery and resilience.

For example, I have around $1000 in Enbridge stock (**TSE: ENB**) and it has around a 7.3% estimated dividend yield, whereas some preferred shares of Enbridge have a higher dividend yield (such as **TSE: ENB.PF.E**, which sits at around 9.7% dividend yield currently).

So my main question is, why wouldn't I just sell all my Enbridge shares and buy their preferred shares (like **TSE: ENB.PF.E**) instead?  
Are these higher risk in some way?  
Why do they not go up and down in the same way as the 'real' stock?  
Why do these preferred shares exist? (and why are there so many types?)  
What is the difference between these preferred shares? (like ENB.PF.A vs ENB.PF.E vs ENB.PF.G?)

I'm sorry if I don't know much, I'm only 23 and recently paid off my student loans so I'd like to invest while the market is down but I don't really know what I'm doing...

As I currently view Bitcoin on Trading212, u got a market price and sell price of $9816 and a buy price of $9851, a difference of $35 or around 0.36%. 

By my understanding, this means that if I were to short the price of Bitcoin, the market price would have to drop by at least $35 for me to break even, and if I go long on the stock the market price would have to rise by at least $35 to over $9851 for me to make any profit. 

Is my understanding here right or am I completely missing the point?

13,t3_gga013,investing,The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

19,t3_gg82fe,investing,Is this the sort of situation Options are for?," 

I'm trying to figure out what Options are actually for so I came to realize that a situation I am in might be the purpose behind why Options exist.

So I have money in sort of like a bond that will mature in a couple months and I want to buy a particular stock I think has a good chance of increasing during that time. Is the purpose of buying an option as intended such that I can pay a little bit of money now to buy a Call such that I can buy the stock at a later date closer to its current price rather than the higher price later on.

For instance I would make the expiry after the bond thing matures and I would put the strike price such that the strike price + the fees and cost of the option are lower than what I can expect the stock to be trading at in a couple months.

This seems like the sort of thing Options are intended to be for, but when it is explained it is usually explained in the context of speculating, never when the money you would use to buy is non-liquid. In this situation the Option is a hedge against the increasing value of the stock while the money you would use to buy it is locked away.

The other situation I think Options are working as intended rather than as mere tools of speculation is when companies give stock options to their employees that are discounted as a form of compensation. The reason the Option gives a price that is different than the actual price in this situation is intended precisely because it is meant to encourage the employee to spend some of their money to get a stock which is worth more than they spent and the difference is compensation for them working such that the instant gain they get upon buying the discounted stock is a bit like a paid salary in that they could sell it immediately after buying it for market value.

If we go into more speculation territory buying an option sort of allows you to ""own"" various stocks at various prices without actually spending the money on them such that you could actually own another stock with that money at the same time. If something happens during that time that makes it a good buy for the strike price you could sell the stock you actually own, use the option, and then if you want you could immediately sell the option bought stock at the market value and re-buy the stock you were holding originally, perhaps even buying more of it with the profit you made with the quick sell-hold-stock, buy-call-stock-at-strike-price, sell-call-stock-for-market-value, buy-original-hold-stock. You could even layer this with many more Options than just one such that you could simultaneously ""own"" all the stocks with the same money with the risk being that your call expires before you have a good time to use it. This gives a lot more diversity than an otherwise small amount of money could provide, not to mention that the only risk you take if the price of these stocks drops is you are out the price of the Option rather than the price of the stock, the issue is you have to keep track of all that information, but if an algorithm did this ... well let's just say I now understand that guy who wanted me to make an options trading algorithm back in university that I turned down doing because I didn't understand what the hell was going on."
20,t3_gg7k9d,investing,The problems with tech stocks,"OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

Retirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.

So, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).

Oh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.

If the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.

Further to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.

This is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good. The stock market is trying to say that, because of reduced competition, prices will soar, and as a result, the middle class craters into abject poverty and the world becomes less and less sustainable and stable and societal collapse is the only logical conclusion."

1. Who has the Fed been buying bonds from? The cash positions of all the big banks are unchanged on their Q1 earnings reports.

2. If the answer is the big banks, has any of this resulted in a higher volume of lending? I have spoken to a mortgage officer and he said he is doing fewer loans because of tighter lending standards.

3. If new money is not being put into circulation, what is fueling the increase in stock prices?"

They can manage to control around 7 **trillion** worth of assets as well as almost 3 times that amount worth of insight through their enterprise software. Blackrock Solutions has insight on the very data it can invest in. Is this not some sort of breach?

This question has been bugging me for years now and I do understand the reason they can be auditors, advisors, and investors all at once. Financial markets are extremely complex and Blackrock has the resources and abilities to tackle financial issues governments and companies have. I understand why they are chosen to fix those issues. But how are they allowed to act in all those roles that overlap?

I do understand the heads of Blackrock are also the founders and they genuinely seem to have a positive interest in society as they are willing to shift and adapt their investment and other business to a more progressive time - think how Dicks and other stores stopped selling guns. This was due to Blackrocks ability to shift market sentiment based on their philosophies. No issues with their philosophies (above was only one example) - but what happens when Blackrock finds itself under new ownership with different views? Would this not completely shift the paradigm of the current financial world?

42,t3_gg0vtt,investing,Why High Unemployment Doesn't Mean Stocks Should Fall,"* In the U.S., at least, a huge percentage of corporate earnings come from tech companies that generate huge profits from relatively few employees
* As an example of the above, consider Facebook, which earned $18 billion last year with 44,000 employees, and contrast it with GM, which earned about $6 billion with 164,000 employees
* This makes employment less relevant to corporate earnings than it was in the past (not to say there's not still a correlation)
* Not only that, but these tech companies have more flexibility to offer Work-From-Home arrangements than other companies do
* So their productivity needn't take a hit during this particular recession; advertising revenue will decline but not to a crippling degree
* Additionally, a good few of these tech companies have almost no debt. No debt means no interest expense, which makes it easier to turn profits even with revenue down.
* Some recent earnings reports bear this out, such as Facebook's 100% year-over-year growth in EPS, Amazon's 26% revenue growth, etc.
* Conclusion: publicly traded U.S. stocks as a class, particularly NASDAQ-listed ones, aren't necessarily seeing their fundamentals being hit that hard when you consider what a large percentage of their composition by market cap is tech stocks.
* Disclaimer: this analysis only applies to U.S. markets, I'm not aware of any other countries whose equity markets have such a heavy weighting in tech stocks."

The day trader, working from his house in a Toronto suburb, figured he couldn’t lose as he spent $2,400 snapping up crude at $3.30 a barrel, and then 50 cents. Then came what looked like the deal of a lifetime: buying 212 futures contracts on West Texas Intermediate for an astonishing penny each.

Its software couldn’t cope with that pesky minus sign, even though it was always technically possible — though this was an outlandish idea before the pandemic — for the crude market to go upside down. Crude was actually around negative $3.70 a barrel when Shah’s screen had it at 1 cent. Interactive Brokers never displayed a subzero price to him as oil kept diving to end the day at minus $37.63 a barrel.

57,t3_gfweu3,investing,"Using data going back to 1971, I graphed the the ""average year"" for the stock market.","[Average Year](https://imgur.com/6a8bTkD.png)

The above picture is the graph of what the average year looks like for the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the span of Jan 1971 - Present. [It was inspired by this (now removed) post from yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gfg0g2/what_does_the_average_year_of_the_stock_market/)

On the horizontal axis, the days of the year are numbered, so 1 = Jan 1st, 2= Jan 2nd, and so on...

**How did I produce this?**

I used the daily closing values for the Dow listed on [this website](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/DJIA/historical-prices). This was the most thorough stock market history I could find on short notice. Let me know if there is a better data set I can use!

I wrote a quick and dirty Python script to calculate the percentage change over every day ranging from 1971 until now and take the geometric mean of those changes for each day of the year, ranging from Jan 1 to Dec 31.

I then put all of those cumulatively together to graph the above.

**What about weekends and holidays?**

The trickiest part conceptually may have been how to interpolate the data to account for weekends and other market closures, since those do not come on regular dates. Since I was using closing values, what I ended up doing for a typical weekend was just geometrically averaging the change from Friday close to Monday close over Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

---

For example, let's say we have the following closing values:

Thurs: 9000
Fri: 9100
Mon: 9300

Then I would calculate the change for Friday to be: 9100/9000 = 1.01111
And I would calculate the change for Sat, Sun, and Mon to be (9300/9100)^1/3 = 1.00727

So the list of changes would look like:

Fri: 1.01111

Sat: 1.00727

Sun: 1.00727

Mon: 1.00727

---

It's not ideal, and can probably cause some artifacts, but it shouldn't matter too much when averaging over a lot of dates.

**Other Graphs:**

I also constructed similar graphs using [arithmetic mean of daily changes](https://imgur.com/dzHFwgt.png) and the [median of daily changes](https://imgur.com/McTs0sT.png).

The arithmetic mean graph is very similar to the geometric mean graph, but is a bit more extreme. This isn't too surprising.

The median graph is much more balanced, which also makes sense. It seems that the most dramatic effects of the first graph are caused by a relatively small number of extreme years.

It would also be really easy to adapt my code to work with a different time span or index. I would just need the data. It might be interesting to compare the average annual performance of different sectors or market caps.

Edit: Added labels to axes."

In other words, large corporations are essentially ""buying out"" these small businesses in the long run. Throw in automation and an increasingly specialized workforce, and we are witnessing the acceleration of the 4th industrial revolution, which ultimately benefits Wall Street.

While everyone's distracted with bitter partisan politics, global mortality leaderboards and the usual nonsense in popular media, the largest wealth exchange in history is going completely unnoticed right under our noses. I don't think many of us plebs can appreciate the magnitude of what's going on. If I was a conspiracy theorist, which I most definitely am not, I would say they couldn't have dreamt up a more perfect scenario for the wholesale theft of main street businesses.

60,t3_gfvwq5,investing,New York City CMBS Delinquencies Rise on $7 Billion of Loans,"By Natalie Wong

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s shutdown is pressuring loans
tied to commercial real estate, with retail and hotels hit the
hardest.
April payments were late on about $7 billion of commercial
mortgage-backed securities debt backed by properties in the
city, more than double the amount a year earlier, according to
data firm Trepp.
About $740 million of those loans are considered
delinquent, meaning at least 30 days behind. Retail and lodging
debt, the sectors with the highest percentage of delinquencies,
accounted for 41% and 19% of the total.
Stay-at-home orders have crushed business at stores,
restaurants and hotels in New York, the center of the
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Owners of these properties --
including hotels in Times Square and shops on Fifth Avenue --
are struggling to pay mortgages as their rent collections fall.
The rate of delinquencies could grow if borrowers continue
to skip payments in May, which is likely given the shutdown’s
impact on the economy.
Some landlords are working out payment arrangements with
their lenders, but options are limited. Special servicers, firms

Given all the economic news, I feel like we're at the ""Printing Money &amp; Credit"" stage and we've been here for quite some time. The virus just dialed it up to 11.

My question: even with a strong recovery around second half of 2020, is an economic downturn (and the eventual downward pressure on the stock market) inevitable given the stage we are currently in? A good number of people have mentioned that corporate debt and commercial mortgages are the next big things that'll come home to roost. To me, it kinda makes sense and I wonder if Covid recovery can really stop these forces and sustainably push the markets to new all-time highs in 2020 - especially with the Fed freshly out of interest rate cuts and printing money like a Charmin' factory doing a mountain of cocaine.

For the bulls and bears, what is your upside and downside thesis?  As you can tell, I'm a bit bearish at the moment and as such, am more curious about the bull thesis, just in case I have a substantial blindspot that's unbeknownst to me.

My strategy would be to buy real estate using leveraged stocks and once fixed up repay the stock loan with traditional cash out refinance on the real estate and the use the cash to repay the loan. Rinse and repeat.

Kinda have a theory and I want to tap your thoughts. With the number of people unemployed many are currently collecting unemployment benefits. of course out of the 30 million unemployed maybe half or three quarters actually have a retirement savings plan and or health savings account. Once that runs out, people are going to start tapping into their IRA/s 401ks and other retirement savings to live on pay bills, rent, mortgage, and make ends meet. Once people start accessing their retirement savings in numbers, many funds will have to liquidate their holdings. Fund will have not choice but to liquidate parts of their holdings. With the outflow of capital this may create a domino effect in which people with regular investment accounts will start to sell. This may weigh heavily on stocks. I'm not sure whether such an event will have a big impact on the stock market. I’m just weighing the possibilities. Just thinking with the extra monies people are receiving from unemployment it is keeping them from accessing their retirement, at least for now. What do you guys think?"

In context: 
So many companies are undervalued but personally  for me it’s impossible to buy a 100 shares of them outright right now. Instead buying a leap a 1 year out would give me enough time to save up for them and also have the company grow back in value. For ex:
A big bank like Bank of America is trading at around 23$, a hundred shares of which would cost me 2300$.  Why not just buy the atm 25$ call for 2.27 and break even of 27.27$ per share(expiring Jan 2021)? 
These stocks are bound to recover as they provide the backbone for the economy (to an extent). So then going to even half of the value they were last year(~35ish) isn’t impossible. 


What’s a good case against buying a leap ? Except for basically loosing the 227$ in the call option."

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■"

87,t3_gfoii9,investing,There might be a logical reason to why the markets keep going up,"Many people seem perplexed about this fact. Bad news should mean that the market should go down. Problem is, bad news means more action from the state/fed. One action is as we all know 0% interest rates. What return do you need to make a profit with 0% interest rates? Anything above 0.

This means that if you can borrow money at 0% and expect a return of 0,000001% you are making a profit. The Fed saying that they will do everything to get full emplyment back means that some investors see the doom and gloom headlines as a confirmation that the Fed will keep rates low. This signals that it's worth borrowing money to put into the market, because any return above 0 is worth it. 

The only question is how long this will last. My guess is when positive news starts taking the overhand, investors will scale back their risk. Simply because the 0% interest rate and state action is less likely to last as long the more positive the sentiment gets on the economy. Sentiment will be more positive in the news and stocks will be going down. People will say that it's rigged - but it's not. It's just how the markets work, even if you hate it.

At least this is how I interpret the current situation and I am short on the market. Unless Fed and State turns positive in their sentiment, my investment is pretty much screwed. But I'm aware of this and I could of course be wrong.

89,t3_gfnavf,investing,Perhaps the most relevant excerpt from one of Ray Dalio's book,"""In the early stages of a bubble bursting, when stock prices fall and earnings have not yet declined, people mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find stocks cheap in relation to both past earnings and expected earnings, failing to account for the amount of decline in earnings that is likely to result from what’s to come. But the reversal is self-reinforcing. As wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, which hurts spending and lowers investment rates while also making it less appealing to borrow to buy financial assets. This in turn worsens the fundamentals of the asset (e.g., the weaker economic activity leads corporate earnings to chronically disappoint), leading people to sell and driving down prices further. This has an accelerating downward impact on asset prices, income, and wealth.""

**Notes:** This portfolio is based of off Paul Merimimans 'BEST-IN-CLASS TAX-DEFERRED ULTIMATE ALL-VALUE ETF' portfolio. I chose this portfolio because I liked how aggressive it was and centered around All Value ETF's. The only thing I didn't like was how high the expense ratios were. I also understand that Value Equities have not performed well the last 10 years or so but historically they have outperformed growth stocks.  


I know I am going to get a lot of flack for this because I am not using the standard 3-fund portfolio but this portfolio made sense to me. It is currently not doing so well and down 18% in total. Current Value: $14,430. I know some of this has to do with the market volatility due to Covid19 but it was not performing well at all before that either.  


**Final Thoughts/Questions:**  


Is this something I should just ride out, stomach the losses right now, and keep maxing out my Roth IRA every year into these funds because Value Equities have performed very well historically?  


Or is this something I really need to be concerned about due to the high expense ratios and how poorly Value Equities have performed the last decade?  


These loses are hard to stomach at the moment but if I am going by history things will work out. I really don't want to sell out of these funds (Especially since I am at a loss right now) but considering this is my retirement, I am willing to do whatever is necessary.  


I truly would love any feedback or thoughts about my current portfolio and wether I should continue moving forward with it or move in a different direction.

104,t3_gfjlre,investing,Can someone help me better understand dividend investing?,"I like the idea of dividend investing but I feel there are many arguments on BOTH sides. I'd like to present a few and discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Dividend stocks aren't good because they just remove from the stock price.**

So that's true. I don't think dividend stocks are good for growth. I think it is a great capital preservation if the company is solid like $T. They are the same price as they were four years ago and it is an excellent way to accumulate shares.

**My question:** Is this more of a wealth preservation option? What about growth dividends? I'd say AAPL and SBUX are examples of this (although I think AAPL is starting to mature as a company, but that is a different problem set on its own).

**2) If they don't grow, why bother?**

I'm not sure what to say about this. Hence the reach out for opinions. I feel that while they don't excel as much as growth stocks, they do grow faster than bonds. A safe bet, IMO. Of course, assuming it is a diversified spread like SPHD which I own a small portion of.

**My question:** Can someone give opinions of good growth dividend stocks that I have not mentioned already? Secondly, can someone help me rationalize point two, where it gives a purpose for dividend investing?

**3) DRIP or no?**

I have a question on this  one. Why not DRIP? If not drip, I guess you can  use the dividend to invest in something else. However, I want to drip so that my dividend stocks accumulate faster. Catch22?

**My question:** I only gave an example of why DRIP is good or not good. Can someone give an argument for both sides?

**4) When to buy?**

I think it is best to buy dividend stocks during a recession. I say this for three good reasons. The first reason is to **accumulate as many shares as possible.** You can not only buy cheap shares at times of recession, you also accumulate shares with dividends. It is a win win if you ask me. My next reason is that I don't really have to worry about selling out. Finally, with dividends, I do have a **cash flow coming in** if I needed it (hopefully not relying on dividend income though lmao). Getting a few low thousand a months through dividends is not that far off or unattainable IMO?

With a grain of salt though, because companies cancel their dividend like Disney and Ford. Fair enough, but that's why I try to mitigate that risk by avoiding individual companies or selecting individual companies with historical dividends (Look up dividend aristocrats). Companies like KO etc. Of course if KO stops giving dividends, then we are in bigger trouble than we realize and cash would be a better alternative.

**My question:** I say the best time is to buy Dividend stocks during recessions. Why? Best way to accumulate shares. Can someone puncture my argument? Secondly, What dividend strategy do you use (loaded question, would appreciate it though)?

**5) Placement**

This one is easy, put it in your tax advantaged accounts. My question is, is there a good position or opportunity in a taxable account? I would put it in a taxable account if I needed to withdraw the dividend income (not DRIP). Unfortunately I live in California so I am dicked.

**My question:** Can anyone think of a scenario/strategy where taxation would be mitigated or even somewhat effective? More specifically and in addition to, when/how would you put in a taxable account? Please don't say when you  have no additional room in your tax-advantaged. That is assumed in this question.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys for reading. Please be safe during these hard times. Best.

125,t3_gfed6b,investing,How to calculate NPV for a project with multiple investors,"Hello everyone! 
I would like to ask two questions. 
1) Let’s say we have a business to be opened, and this project requires $100,000 of initial investments. Assuming that we have 2 partners (30 to 70) to cover the funding required, how do we calculate NPV? Let’s say the business will generate 70,000 in year 1 and 70,000 in year 2. Interest rate is 10% for simplicity. The profits are shared at 30% to 70%.
How do we calculate NPV? I guess there should be 2 different NPVs, because partners have different initial outlays and cash flows. Am I right?
Or NPV of the project is calculated for the whole project?

2) But what if we add loan to our case? Let’s say two partners invest 30% and 30% (30,000 each) and 40,000 is a loan. Interest rate is 10%. Interest rate on loan is 20%. 
Should I include the 40,000 loan as an initial outlay as these are not the money that we invest ourselves? And should I subtract the loan payments from the cash inflows from the project?

I’m very sorry for asking such dumb questions, I just don’t get the concept.

I can understand that investing with someone else’s money will minimise personal risk, but the person investing in your investment is expecting returns also. 
Where is all this money coming from that supposedly makes you rich while investing someone else’s money? No one in their right mind would invest in someone if they are getting the least out of the deal.

That leaves me with a question, where does the price of Tesla stock come from? A stock that pays dividents has value because if you hold the stock when there is a divident payout you earn money. But holding a stock that doesn't pay dividents earns you no money. This is where Tesla comes in. I get that Tesla can be worth more than GM because in the future Tesla will sell more cars, but if you hold GM stock for a year you will have gotten multiple divident payouts,  but if you have held Tesla stock for a year you wouldn't have gotten a cent (other than the increase in stock value).

Here’s my theory:

A significant component in the rise of housing prices since the 1980s is due to declining interest rates.  The supply is constrained so it’s responsive to the ability of buyers to outbid each other.  Americans are used to the idea of spending 30% or whatever of their household income on their mortgage payment, maybe more.  If interest rates drop but real wages stay the same and the percentage of money spent on housing stays the same, then the principal has to increase.  Which means housing prices go up.

But now we’re pretty much touching against risk adjusted 0% interest rates.  If it was any cheaper the bank might as well be paying you.  The interest rate cannot keep dropping in order to fuel more housing price increase.  So there’s not really any more room for housing prices to boost off low interest rates.  There’s probably still time until they adjust to current rates and an increase when the economy eventually picks up again, but the growth seen over the past three decades is coming to an end.

Also, there’s significant risk if inflation picks up.  If housing and wages both rise in pace with inflation their ratio stays the same, but interest rates will also climb.  This means that buyers must now commit a larger portion of their gross income to P&amp;I payments.  If lenders won’t allow them to do that then the only way to accommodate increased i is by lowering p.  Which means housing has to lose value if that happens."

But the question is, do I want to wait while there are other, more conscious-friendly options out there?

My beef with Boeing's business model is that they have some really bad executives running the company into the ground long term. Boeing executives are the prototypical corporate dickhead Chad-types, who only look for short term gain at all cost. They are really the caricature of greed and privilege. Boeing spent considerable amount of their capital buying back stocks and executive comps, which inherently has 0 value to the company's business success. Management's comp tied to stock performance is great for stockholders, but that has not materialized for me yet. Most recently, Boeing refused government bailout money and opted to be beholden to private banks because taking government money would mean the CEO and his buddies would not be able to fire employees, continue stock buybacks in the future, and do all the things required of a conscientious, socially responsible corporation.

185,t3_gf16kn,investing,"A wave of bankruptcies, surging taxes, and Americans harboring lasting scars from coronavirus lockdowns — the head of world’s largest asset manager warns of grim outlook","BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

He’s the definition of the broken clock. For years—decades—he’s been making incredibly bad predictions. He called crashes in 2011 ([this article](https://www.investmentnews.com/u-s-stocks-may-slide-24-as-recession-looms-raoul-pal-37535), 2015 ([2015 crash](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2015/07/31/man-who-called-dollar-rally-sees-catastrophe-ahead.html), and several other calls that were totally wrong. Articles refer to him as they man who predicted the dollar rally’ or something complete bull badge of honor. 

He’s also adamant that bonds are better than equities (how?) and just today said that bitcoin will be worth $1 million by next year. He says we’re going into a depression now and suggested that the market won’t recover for at least a decade. He’s once again calling a crash of 1929 proportions. 

I keep seeing him as a guest or featured on prominent podcasts and articles, and yet what he’s saying makes absolutely no sense and he’s constantly wrong to the point of lunacy.

191,t3_gezlhu,investing,Noob question: Why isn't the dividend reinvestment price always the current sale price?,"I own some shares of PONAX, which i purchased last year at 12.08 dollars. When I purchased them, I enabled dividend reinvestment, as I pretty much always do. Since I bought them, the price has tanked to 11.13 or so.

However, looking at my Schwab purchase history, the dividend reinvestment purchases have been happening at exactly 12.08 dollars every month, which means I've been paying above market price for every single acquisition. PONAX is the only fund I own exhibiting this behavior, all my other funds seem to dividend reinvest at the current market price for the day of the distribution.

Is there something I'm not understanding, or am I giving PONAX free money?"

203,t3_gevst0,investing,Vanguard’s Market Cap ETFs Are Not What They Seem,"I’m thinking of putting together a market cap etf portfolio with a 60/25/15 allocation from large to small. I’ve been looking at vanguards market cap blend ETFs and upon closer look them seem to not accurately reflect the traditional definitions of the market capitalizations they should represent. 

Generally, the market cap ranges are as follows...
Small: $300 Million to $2 Billion
Mid: $2 Billion to $10 Billion
Large: $10 Billion or Higher

The median market capitalization for each ETF should fall in line with these ranges if it is accurate.

Below are the main Vanguard Market Cap ETFs and the median market cap value for each.

VB: Small Cap ($3.6 Billion)
VO: Mid Cap ($13.4 Billion)
VV: Large Cap ($112.7 Billion)

Most of these ETFs have a median value above the usual metrics. The Small Cap ETF is really a Mid Cap ETF. The Mid Cap ETF is really a Large Cap ETF. The Large Cap ETF is valued in the middle of a Large Cap and a Mega Cap (Mega Cap being a value of over $200 Billion) so this seems ok to me.

There are other ETFs offered through Vanguard that more accurately hit the definition. These follow along the S&amp;P Index for each capitalization. They are listed below with the median market cap value.

VIOO: S&amp;P 600 Small Cap ($1.4 Billion)
IVOO: S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap ($4.3 Billion)
VOO: S&amp;P 500 Large Cap ($118.7 Billion)

With the exception of VOO, these other ETFs have a median value of about a third of the other respective funds and they are also traded much less. Only VOO has a substantial Total Net Asset Value.

VOO is worth a staggering $443.6 Billion. It’s cousin, VV is only worth $21.9 Billion. Clearly, investors prefer to hold VOO. The same is true for the others.

IVOO is worth $1.6 Billion, VO is worth $84.6 Billion.
VIOO is worth $1.7 Billion, VB is worth $69.3 Billion.

Investors clearly prefer the funds that don’t follow the metrics.

Why would vanguard throw in a substantial amount of stocks that are in the next market cap tier into funds of lesser value? Is it to smooth out the volatility that small caps and mid caps usually experience? Or have stocks gone up in value so much that the traditional definitions no longer fit and Vanguard is making their own definitions. Comparing a $10 Billion company today to what a $10 Billion company was 20 years is not a fair comparison. Since we’re in the age of Mega Caps, should the metrics be expanded across all fronts to accommodate this change?

*just found this explanation from Investopedia...

“large investments in small companies can actually have the effect of adversely affecting the share price of the small company being bought or sold in the fund. For this reason, small-cap stock funds that have high net assets tend to buy stocks of larger-capitalization companies, which can cause the fund to evolve into a mid-cap stock fund, getting away from the fund's initial focus. This is called style drift”"

208,t3_geu5e2,investing,What Buffett actually said about Berkshire's Cash Position,"Getting tired of reading posts from people who clearly didn't watch or read this earnings report or probably any earnings report so here we go. Tldr: His cash position (actually t-bills) is not large compared to the entirety of Berk's assets. Now can you all stop with the ""But Buffett's holding cash"" meme?

""I show our net, our cash and Treasury bill position on March 31st. And you might look at that and say, “Well, you’ve got $125 billion or so in cash and Treasury bills. And you’ve got…” At least at that point, we had about, I don’t know, $180 billion or so in equities. And you can say, “Well, that’s a huge position to have in Treasury bills versus just $180 billion in equities.”
 
But we really have far more than that in equities because we own a lot of businesses. We own 100% of the stock of a great many businesses, which to us are very similar to the marketable stocks we own. We just don’t own them all. They don’t have a quote on them. But we have hundreds of billions of wholly owned businesses. So our $124 billion is not some 40% or so cash positions, it’s far less than that. 

And we will always keep plenty of cash on hand, and for any circumstances, with a 9/11 comes along, if the stock market is closed, as it was in World War I—it’s not going to be, but I didn’t think we were going to be having a pandemic when I watched that Creighton-Villanova game in January either.""

I've used Portfoliovisualizer to backtest these ETFs to a similar benchmark, and they've seemed to beat them by quite a significant margin.

Thoughts on these ETFs? I know past performance does not predict future performance, but the methodology used by these ETFs to select stocks seems sound, and the MER isn't too unreasonable (cheaper than almost all mutual funds)."
210,t3_getl49,investing,Tripled investing owner occupied,"Created this burner account so I could leave more information about my location as people asked why Properties were so cheap and rent is so high where I live.

Real estate is extremely cheap in the small sub 50k population city I live in. I plan to live in one of the units to get a lowered down payment. I’m self employed and I’m aware this will require me to show more years of tax returns. I PLAN TO BUY A YEAR FROM NOW (June of 2021) Here are my questions


- The property is for sale at 85k, what would my income need to be at minimum to purchase this property to be approved by the bank? 


- My credit score is 700-720, will that help me when getting a loan? (I’m only 20) 


-I use my local credit union and I plan on getting a loan through them, or should I use a big bank?

From March 2019 up until October 2019 the unemployment rate grew from 5% to 10% and during that time the stock market also grew from the DOW hitting a low of 6,400 in March to hitting 10,000 in October. 

But what do I know I’m just a landscaper."
212,t3_get1nm,investing,$RSI - Rogers Sugar - good TSX-listed yield play,"I've been keeping an eye on and recently bought TSX:RSI. It's currently trading at a 7.5%+ yield and is still trading about 25% off pre-COVID highs. \~$95mm EBITDA business with $5-$10mm of maintenance capex. Brokers are shitting on it because they didn't hit Q2 estimates (+25% EBITDA growth, whereas they were flat), but given the climate we're in - and yield it's trading at - IDGAF.

**Some thoughts on why I like it:**

* **Stable volume.** Yes, per capita sugar consumption is declining, but with NA population growth, it's stable to moderately growing. And with everything going on in the world, the fact that volumes have not been impacted is positive.
* **Limited price risk.** Sugar is a transparent, liquid market. RSI matches future sales to purchases, so it doesn't take commodity risk. It basically earns a dollar margin per lb.
* **Stable free cash flow.** Given the above, FCF is quite stable. Maintenance capex is relatively small. The company is a bit of a NWC pig, but given low volume/price risk above it's been manageable.
* **Low risk to distribution.** Given stable FCF and $100mm of borrowing room, distributions don't appear to be at risk. Payout ratios are high (biggest knock on RSI), but in a flat market and modest capital needs, what else are would they do with that cash.
* **Free option on Maple Syrup.** RSI acquired one of the largest maple syrup producers in 2017, which has been an absolute dog. But that capital has been spent, and so I view earnings to be somewhat trough-y.
* **Installed capacity.** I've been looking for businesses with good installed capacity in this market. Companies with solid PP&amp;E that have some nameplate capacity and earnings power. I like them because negative operating leverage is hitting earnings hard, but you should get torque on the way out of COVID. RSI isn't experiencing this, but it's good downside protection.
* **Duopoly producer.** One of two sugar producers in Canada, and no one is investing in processing capacity any time soon given growth trends.
* **Structural market benefits.** USA sugar market is a protected market with high import tariffs that can mean prices that are 2x Canadian prices. Food producers can manufacture in Canada with cheap sugar, and then import finished products into America without tariffs; drives steady demand.

**This one isn't without its hair:**

* **Future volume.** While it's positive that volumes were strong in Q2 2020, that might reflect contracts they sold well before COVID. That said, their product is going into shelf-stable products and confectionary, which are experiencing record-high demand.
* **Supply chain.** If RSI can't get their hands on raw materials because international supply chains are clogged up, then that would be a big deal. It looks like they have about 3 mos of inventory on hand.
* **Payout ratio.** It does have a high payout ratio and you can sensibly argue it's risky. I don't see it, but I understand the argument.
* **Leverage.** Aside from 4.0x debt, the capital structure is stinky. A bunch of convertible debt outstanding (5%, converts at $8.00+) which might preclude the Company taking on additional debt and issuing additional equity - distributions would be first to go.
* **Insider governance.** Finally, the governance structure is a bit of a mess that I think might ward off interested acquirers in considering a takeover."

If I bought the original 12 stocks of the DJIA when it was first formed, what would the value of my holdings be today? I ask because when articles promote a ""buy and hold"" strategy they usually use the DJIA returns or S&amp;P returns which are not truly buy and hold. Different stocks move into and out of those indexes all the time so there is plenty of selling and buying going on.

I'd also be interested in seeing the current return of the DJIA and S&amp;P stocks bought and held to present for all years in the past. For example, buy the stocks on the 1985 S&amp;P and hold them until now, what would be the return?

VERX Vanguard FTSE Europe ex UK 
VGWD Vanguard FTSE All-World  HighDividend

VERX is there too put more weight on stocks in Euro (and other European currencies) to decrease exposure to US$ a bit. Could have chosen a purely Eurozone ETF, but I feel the addition of Switzerland/Scandivia leads to a better balance industry-wise.
 
VGWD is there basically to make sure that there are sufficient payouts per year to max out the tax-free capital gains per year in Germany. Could be dropped if/when payouts of the others are enough to reach the maximum.

EQQQ to put some more emphasis on growth stocks. Would have preferred MGK, but this is not available in Germany or at least not my bank.

 (Profit, not considering tax liability).

TLDR: If you could buy 100 shares below $22.49 and the share price rises on the 14th as everyone is buying in, the put premium should also get cheaper. Buy 6/19 $30p for $7.50 or less. This would save you money on all sides and you could actually get a decent return not accounting for taxes. In theory of course."

1) when I ran it, a ton of companies pinged warnings  on the first indicator (just seeing if their Total Assets and Total liabilities matched their respective equations (Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity, and Total Liabilitities = Total Assets - Equity). For the most part a lot seemed within 1-2% off, so I adjusted the code to ignore if the numbers it +/- 3% off, but I'm still getting hits probably every 5th or so company that goes through, and a lot of them are like 20% off. Is there any other explanation for this? The equations themselves seem fine and when I run them through bigger companies who are constantly under a microscope, and the ratios work out. 

2) another indicator I have measures Operating Cash flow/Sales. Essentially, I have it so if the ratio falls below 1/3rd the previous quarters ratio, it gets flag, indicating that there was a substantial increase/stagnant sales without corresponding cash flow. This 1/3rd is just a placeholder for now.

So my 2 questions:
For first part, is this realistic that there could be some low levels of fraud in say 20% of all companies? A lot of the tickets are ones I've never heard of before, leaving me to believe thwyre a lot of smaller companies (havent had the chance to go through them individually).

252,t3_gekay7,investing,Shopify Recent #'s + Mercadolibre +23% after earnings,"E-commerce doing well - Shopify with some interesting stats (see bolded) and Mercadolibre, too.

SHOP:

**New stores created on the Shopify platform grew 62% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 compared
to the prior six weeks**, driven by the shift of commerce to online as well as by the extension of the free trial
period on standard plans from 14 days to 90 days. While this increase includes both first-time entrepreneurs
as well as established sellers, it is unclear how many in this cohort will sustainably generate sales, which is
the primary determinant of merchant longevity on our platform. New store creations represents merchants
who have provided billing information, which also allows them to start selling.


While year-over-year Gross Merchandise (""GMV"") growth accelerated in April compared with the
first quarter of 2020, and this growth was distributed over a broader base of merchants, it is unclear how
sustainable consumer spending levels will be in this uncertain economic environment. For now, the shift of
consumer spending toward online is apparent: the number of consumers estimated to have made a purchase
for the first time from any Shopify merchant grew 8% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, compared
to the six-week period immediately prior. Over the same period, the number of consumers estimated to have
purchased from Shopify merchants they’d never shopped at before grew by 45% compared to the six-week
period immediately prior.

**While GMV through the point-of-sale (POS) channel declined by 71% between March 13, 2020 and April 24,
2020 relative to the comparable six-week period immediately prior to March 13, as most of Shopify’s Retail
merchants suspended their in-store operations, *Retail merchants managed to replace 94% of lost POS GMV
with online sales over the same period*.** Retail merchants are adapting quickly to social-distance selling, as
26% of our brick-and-mortar merchants in our English-speaking geographies are now using some form of
local in-store/curbside pickup and delivery solution, compared to 2% at the end of February.

While new types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus, March and April also saw
more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February.

Certain categories of GMVgrew faster between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020, including Food, Beverages,
and Tobacco, which doubled during this period relative to the 6-weeks immediately prior to March 13. Apparel
and accessories, a historically larger contributor to Shopify's GMV, experienced a softening in GMV in midMarch, followed by a recovery at the end of March, which continued into April. 

Mercadolibre:

The marketplace KPI’s hit a low point during the week of the 18th to the 24th of March. **Yearover-year growth for items sold during that week troughed at 3.3%, with Fx Neutral GMV
declining by 1.4%. From then onwards, we have seen a strong rebound, with growth rates
accelerating in April to 75.8% year-over-year in Items Sold and 72.6% Fx Neutral year-overyear in GMV for the full month.**"

254,t3_gek53d,investing,Trying to understand the whys and hows of negative price in crude oil,"Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.

With the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.

So here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: ""If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?""

But let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.

1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.

1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?

1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that ""The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible"". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?

1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?

1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?

1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?

1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.

1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?

1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?

1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I’m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won’t be interested in small transaction? What’s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.

1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?

2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  
quite confusing

2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?

2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?

2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?

2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?

2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?

3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  
anybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  
with classic brokers.

3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren’t they?

3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.

3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?

3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?

3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:

\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?

\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts

\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?

\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO

3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?

3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?

3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?

3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?

3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?

3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?

3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?

3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?

3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?

256,t3_gejaoc,investing,Analysis of penny stock WLL," 

For someone who is interested in penny stocks, here is my way to analyze WLL for your reference.

On April 1, WLL filed for chapter 11 to restructure. The price of WLL tumbled from 0.8-1 to 0.3-0.4 after the declaration. By the RTS (restructure term sheet) WLL filed to SEC on April 1, original stockholder will get 3% new issued shares (97% belongs to unsecured Note’s holder) and 15% warrants (4-5years duration), all subject to be diluted by the 8% stock stimulus package for the management and employees after restructuring.

According the “un-levered”, “low CAPEX” version pro-forma (lender Cleansing Materials) attached at the same filing, average FCF per year is 136m for the coming years. If we use 10x FCF for valuation, WLL’s equity value post-restructuring will be 1360m. If the Qty of new shares issued is the same as the original shares, there will be 91m post-restructuring shares outstanding. Thus, by estimation, stock price will be around 15 per share in the coming years if everything goes as the pro-forma. The value of each pre-restructuring share will be 15\*0.03\*0.92=0.414 after restructuring.

As for the warrants, exercise price is 110% and 125% of the amount of current unsecured note’s value, which is around 2B. According to the equity value we derived from the pro-forma, those warrants will not be in the money for the coming years. However, if the oil price surges tremendously within 4-5 years, say 60 USD up, those warrants might feedback fruitful return.

Furthermore, there are still 1B secured loan subject to be unimpaired by the RTS. How the company will pay the bill is still uncertain.

Generally speaking, evaluating company like this is highly speculative. In my opinion, the range of the estimated value of pre-restructuring WLL equity is very large, depends on how you assess the value of warrants and the feasibility of the pro-forma. I think price below 0.3 might be a bargain. How much markup you would like to pay will depend on how your confidence for the pro-forma and the perspective of oil price.

The investment for the penny stocks is never an easy job and requires much more detail study and check. The abnormal high return just reflects the extra efforts demanded for the time-consuming analysis and the super high speculative nature for those investments."

&gt; I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”

I'm more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it's left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.

I don't see how they won't fail as S&amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can't refinance any more.

Yes, Trolls2 was wildly more successful than anticipated, but this was a result of such morbidly special circumstances that it can’t reasonably be used as a way to predict future success. I also wonder how many of those $20 rentals were accidental purchases from kids who just happened to have the remote in hand. 

With such a massive collection of movies available in every streaming platform’s catalog already built into the subscription fee, can we really assume $20-$30 for a 48 hour rental of a new release is going to become part of streaming culture? And if it does, that is still a fraction of the revenue a theater would generate from getting a family in the doors. 

I guess the question is this: are there enough families willing to pay for that rental fee, who might otherwise have waited until after the theatrical release to see the movie? And by “enough”, I mean significantly more than the number of families who would have gone to the theater but will choose to stream instead. 

My guess is no.

And now that AMC put their foot down (with cineworld joining their side), it will almost certainly be a net loss in revenue for Universal. 

So what will universal do? Hold their ground? Look for a compromise? Walk back the move entirely? Unless theaters get a say in the specific titles and the number of releases distributed this way every year, I can’t see them reaching a compromise any other way."

&gt; Shareholders on Monday approved a plan to **convert nearly $1 billion of debt into equity and raise up to 400 million crowns ($39 million) from the sale of new shares** to help the airline survive the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Norwegian aims to sell new shares at 1.0 crown each, it said, far less than Tuesday's closing price of 4.80 crowns as it seeks to attract investors even while the debt conversion leads to a massive dilution of ownership stakes.

&gt; **If the process fails however, Norwegian Air is at risk of running out of money by mid-May** even though it only pays invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, it said on April 27.

&gt; The debt conversion will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and **could leave current shareholders with just 5.2%**, and with further dilution for owners who do not take part in the share issue.

266,t3_gegnaf,investing,Which markets or industries do you see perform best in the next decades (geographic vs. industry focus vs. cap size)? How do you build this into a strategy and portfolio to maximize expected risk-adjusted future returns?,"I often get confused when people here argue whether one could beat ""the market"". Which ""market"" are they referring to? Assuming Equities, which equities and index? MSCI World? S&amp;P500? FTSE100? ASX200? Emerging markets? 

Many portfolios suggested here seem to suggest a strong U.S. bias for equities, and even an MSCI world would have almost 40% U.S. equity exposure. While it's true that the S&amp;P500 has had strong past returns over many time periods, there's plenty of research suggesting that over the same periods other markets have outperformed.

Let's assume for a minute that ""the market"" is the S&amp;P500 (or MSCI world index, irrelevant for my point). In times of low-cost ETFs widely available and being able to shift the weightings of one's portfolio relatively easily to replicate a strategy, I think it makes sense to compare this reference index and their **risk adjusted returns** to other indices along different dimensions. For equities, the obvious ones are

* **Geographic focus**  
Comparing reference indices in different countries can be an interesting exercise. Quite surprisingly, the Australian, South African, and Swedish stock market have had higher *risk adjusted* returns over different periods (16 years, 40 years, 116 years) than the S&amp;P500.  
[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/07/30/which-country-has-the-best-stock-market/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/07/30/which-country-has-the-best-stock-market/)   
One might also look into historic performance of emerging markets vs. U.S, Europe or OECD.
* **Company size**  
There's plenty of research suggesting that small caps, at least in certain geographies, have historically outperformed large cap over long periods of time.  
[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/) 
* **Company/market maturity**  
Over the past decade, 'growth' stocks have outperformed 'value'-stocks in the U.S. and other markets. 
* **Sector focus**  
Similarly, if one had put more emphasis on tech (e.g. NASDAQ) and placed their bet on buying QQQ, returns would have significantly higher since the past bull run. 

Now obviously past performance does not predict future returns, but it's one data point and can be considered alongside other factors. These include current valuations of such markets or sectors (particularly when it comes to investing lump sums at a certain point of time) and more importantly larger themes such as changes in political landscapes and the geopolitical environment, climate change and shift towards renewables, urbanization (or de-urbanization due to COVID?), digitization, etc.

With a lot of data on past performance of different indices available and reflecting on major socioeconomic and political trends that will shape our lives in the next decades, I'd be interested in creating a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs, which over the next 20-30 years is likely to outperform the classic bogleheads 3-fund portfolio or an MSCI world and potentially offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to those indices. Suggestions should be evidence-based on a combination of past returns and outlook into the future, rather than saying ""just put your money into FANG or an AI or ROBO-ETF"".

With that in mind, which mix of markets, or sectors, do you see outperforming over the next decades compared to a S&amp;P500 or MSCI world reference index, how would you build a low-cost portfolio based on that strategy, and with which weightings? Let's discuss!"

I wanted to get a pulse check to see how this sub is handling their investment behavior going forward.  

After the aggressive April rally, we are starting to see some of the economic effects (bankruptcies, more layoffs, more corporate debt concerns).  If you were to characterize your current and near term (next 6-12 month) investing behavior, how would you classify it?  

* 100% invested and planning on aggressively investing more if there is another downturn
* Positions are trimmed but will reinvest if there is another downturn
* Positions are trimmed and will stay on the sidelines until the dust clears

Personally, I am the latter.   I have about 60% of my investable money on the sidelines.  I am not waiting for the crash or trying to time the bottom, I just do not feel comfortable having all of my marbles in the market with so much uncertainty.  

Background: I am early 30s, stable income, no debt.  Have a 6 month emergency fund.  Everything else is free to be invested.  40% invested in equities (24% ETFs, 12% blue Chips, 4% in speculative fun stocks), the other 60% is free to be invested but sitting on the sidelines.

I came across an interesting ETF that uses an option collar strategy to protect against downside risk That is, it sells calls against the underlying securities and then uses the revenue to buy protective puts.

It's called **NUSI**, or *Nationwide Risk-Managed Income ETF*.

It's appealing to me for a few reasons:

* I looked at its performance during the recent crash and it outperformed everything else (SPY, QQQ, etc.): [https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8p6uFb.jpg[/img])
* It pays out a generous dividend from the sale of call options, at an amount that is competitive with bond funds: [7.71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/nusi/dividend-history) 
* Although it has a higher expense ratio, it would be easier to buy this than try to build my own downside protection (e.g., buying protective puts), which can be a full time job. 

My goals would be to avoid inflation risk and have reasonable returns without a large drawdown.

I had two questions:

1. What might be the risks with buying this ETF?
2. What would the tax treatment be when the stocks they trade have protective puts on them? I believe it resets the clock on capital gains. Are those taxes deducted by the fund manager from the overall returns or does it get paid by the holder when the 1099 is distributed?

&gt; Warren Buffett has said he loves to curl up with companies’ annual reports. When asked how to get smarter, Buffett once held up stacks of paper and said he “read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.” 

&gt; Once Buffett determines the intrinsic value of the company as a whole, he compares it to its current market capitalization—the current total worth or price. If his intrinsic value measurement is at least 25% higher than the company's market capitalization, Buffett sees the company as one that has value.

That being said,  I've found some great (IMO) financial statements of a company that is somehow undervalued by investors.  I know some would argue it is important to know  the company business, competitors, etc. And I agree.

However, I would like to make an ""experiment"", and let you see first the numbers, without knowing nothing about the company. And then see if we're biased depending on countries/sectors/ethics,etc.

306,t3_ge41ef,investing,Viable options strategy?,"So I’ve been looking at options and thinking about different strategies, and I was wondering if this one was viable. 

It’s similar to a synthetic long where you buy a call and sell a put except that they are not for the same strike price or expiry. You would buy an OTM call for a short expiry and sell a put for a OTM somewhat further out expiry.

The sale of the put pays for the call. This means that profits are realized at or below the strike price. So even if the stock doesn’t move upward you are at least breaking even. This eliminates the risk of loss due to sideways price movement.

This of course does increase risk if the stock price were to fall, but depending on the circumstances there may be a low probability of that happening. 

For example, let’s say you thought EURN was going to have an excellent earnings announcement. EURN is currently at $10 posting earnings 5/7. You can buy a $12.5 Call for $0.38 for 5/15 expiry. You can sell a $5 Put for $0.40 for 8/21 expiry. So you are overall ITM upon executing. Your total possible risk is $480 if the stock falls to $0, but the likelihood of losing money at all is extremely low because EURN hasn’t been less than $7 since 2013. If your bet pays off, you could even buy out the put contract if it was making you nervous due to the longer expiry and it should be cheaper at that point. 

So is this a viable strategy? Does it already have a name? Is there a better way?"

&gt; 
&gt; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is suing Uber and Lyft, alleging the ride sharing companies have misclassified their drivers as contractors. City attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego have joined Becerra in the lawsuit.
&gt; 
&gt; The lawsuit gets to the heart of a recent debate between gig economy companies and California officials. The lawsuit is based on a California law that went into effect earlier this year, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5). Uber, Lyft and other companies opposed the law, which was created as a way to require gig economy companies to classify their drivers as employees, rather than contractors. The companies have said the law strips workers of flexibility in work that they enjoy, while government officials backing the bill say it affords workers key benefits they are otherwise denied as contractors.
&gt; 
&gt; “Uber and Lyft claim that properly classifying drivers as employees is incompatible with flexibility. That is a lie,” San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement. “There is no legal reason why Uber and Lyft can’t have a vast pool of employees who decide for themselves when and where they work – exactly as drivers do now. These companies simply don’t want to do it.”
&gt; 
&gt; The plaintiffs are seeking and injunction on the alleged misclassification and restitution for workers and civil penalties that could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the lawsuit."
310,t3_ge2x0n,investing,"Aside from some speculation, I actually think the market is being fairly rational","There are a lot of people saying that the market should be going down right now. I used to be one of them, but I've backed out of that hypothesis. Now, I think the market is pretty well priced (aside from a few speculative cases). Here are my thoughts on that.

1. The companies with the biggest exposure to COVID-19 have already gone down in price. Airlines, cruise companies, hotels, casinos, oil etc. 
2. The companies that are going up in price mostly have good balance sheets or corporate debt options to cover 6+ months of operating expenses. Big oil companies are probably the best suited to weather this storm as they always carry a lot of cash to weather low oil price storms. 
3. Most companies without direct exposure to COVID-19 have a smaller market cap today than they did 3 months ago. Indicating an already expected lower cash flow for the foreseeable future due to recession. Q2-Q4 earnings will be trash, and that is mostly expected.
4. The affects of the virus and economic impact of a second wave has mostly been priced in to stock prices. Just because we get bad news about another wave or that we'll be in recession isn't going to affect stock prices much.
5. The initial affects and expected secondary effects of the recession have mostly been priced in. We all know there will be big layoffs in the coming months. 
6. Financial systems have been stabilized by the fed so the risk of financial institutions going belly up is pretty low. 

I know we hate to say it's all ""priced in"", but I can't find a good example a slow recovery isn't priced in. It seems like most stocks are expecting a slow 2020 with a pickup in 2021. That, to me, seems pretty reasonable. A early 2021 vaccine isn't guaranteed, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that we'll have news (either successful or indications that a vaccine is very close) for a vaccine late this year. Even if a vaccine hasn't been produced, we'll be looking at herd immunity in a few key areas. 

Some thing that may not be priced in right now, but are not guaranteed to happen (hence expecting them to happen is speculation).

1. An exceptionally long (2+ years) time before a vaccine is discovered. 
2. A very short immunity after being infected (only 1 year of immunity before getting reinfected). 
3. Second wave in China. 
4. A particularly brutal second wave in the USA.
5. Financial system collapse.
6. Particularly extensive depression heavily affecting large companies.
7. A swing left in politics hitting the cash value of big businesses. Biggest effect could be a halt in M&amp;A or serious anti-trust laws breaking up FAANG companies. 
8. Mid-Long term fossil fuel demand collapse.
9. Bankruptcies of publicly traded companies. I think this will cause the next bear market, but it's months away. There is still runway for companies with shitty balance sheets. And who's to say the fed won't step in to buy up shitty of shit junk bonds. 

In other words, most of the obvious stuff has been priced in.

With all that said, there is definitely quite a bit of speculation going on. Tesla and Amazon are the two biggest examples. Their stock price right now is expecting them to make 5-10x their current revenue. It's not inconceivable, but IMO it's very bullish on a 5 year timescale. Another example, USO seems to be bought up by retail investors pushing up oil prices speculating that oil demand will return this summer (and there won't be a second wave crashing prices again). If that's the case, we'll see the price of oil collapse again when the June contracts expire. 

So I don't expect a bull or bear market in the coming months. More of a sideways market."

312,t3_ge21dy,investing,[AAL] American Airlines' risk of bankruptcy.,"So I bought a handful of AAL stocks in this recent low because it's pretty close to all time low. Also it's less than fifth of the price of all time high. All relevant news headlines are negative which I assume is making this stock tank even more making this a potentially really profitable investment in the long term when things ease down.

Obviously the risk is bankruptcy. Compared to Southwest or Delta their fundamentals are pretty shit. High debt burden, low profit margins. They're burning over 50 million in cash a day.

They got the biggest loan and a grant from the government in the recent aid. And they're the biggest airline with over 100k employees (also with America in their name lol) which makes me think the fed will help them if shits hits the fan and they become really close to bankruptcy. I know they declared bankruptcy before but I believe this time government intervention is more likely due to the damage being caused by the corona.

I've also been considering selling my current stakes in them and just buying Southwest or Delta which seem to have much better financials and fundamentals to survive this crisis, but potentially less % gains post recovery.

Some states are obviously in a better position than others (e.g. CA which has been running a budget surplus for a few years, whereas NY is cash strapped), but at what point does paying the bond obligations become an issue?  

Even if state gov'ts are well capitalized, some are issued by counties and backed by property taxes.  Using CMF as an example ""State Tax-Backed"" bonds form only ~30% of the portfolio.

Pair that with gov't likely issuing newer bonds to fund increased expenses brought on by Covid*, I don't see a case to hold muni bonds for the time being.  They've recovered a lot since the Fed provided the backstop.  

So, does it make sense to sell while things before more bad news comes?

I am still long, as I think this stock is way oversold with nearly 100% short interest and unlike other retailers, I think this company has actually benefitted from the coronavirus lockdown.

With new consoles coming out, good management focusing on paying down debt and the coronavirus allowing the company to clear out old outdated gaming inventory and close brick and mortar locations that are cash flow negative, GameStop will have a headstart in a post-corona world.

329,t3_gduff8,investing,Why SoftBank invested in WeWork in the first place?,"I just happen to check several investments SoftBank invested in the US in the past few years. Many of them never took off. If you dig a little deeper, you will find many companies SoftBank invested call themselves ""technology"" company. In reality, most of them just add a little fancy tech into the existing operation on a particular industry and re-brand as ""technology"" start up.

For example:  Katerra. Softbank invested over $1B into it while the result is abysmal. It looks like this is a traditional construction company but led by former Flextronics's CEO. Katerra is plowing money into building new facilities while they can buy existing ones below replacement. Now, they are forced to close facilities they built a few years ago and laying off workers. (link:  [https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/](https://therealdeal.com/2019/12/16/softbank-funded-construction-startup-katerra-promised-a-tech-revolution-its-struggling-to-deliver/) ) If Softbank wants innovation in this field, why not just buy a well established construction company and add hire some technology talents?  It should be way cheaper than put hundred of millions dollars into a so called tech start up? Would an established profitable general contractor like Manhattan Construction cost 1B?

Another one is Flexport. Is there any difference between Uber Freight and Flexport?

We all know SoftBank investment managers are pretty smart. They know most of their investment cannot change a particular industry or even remotely profitable in the long term. **Why they make this kind of mistakes in the first place?** If they want to invest in office rental business, shouldn't they buy Regus?

The big issue I see them having so far is that the cost to buy one of these machines is still very very high and would take a long time to be worth it.

My question is do you guys think now is a good time to invest in these companies while their stocks are still low or wait a few years for them to work out the bugs, become more cost effective, and start becoming more mainstream. I think these machines will eventually replace the human workers in many industries like fast food, question is when do you think that  will happen and when do you think a good time to invest would be?

They fell a lot more than I would have expected during mid-march (see below). I noticed that some of them fell by only 0.25% back in the 20% decline of December 2018, so seeing a 5-10% fall during March was kind of scary to be honest because it's a good example of how dysfunctional the markets were. The financial system was falling off a cliff. Only the government backed short term treasury ETFs held up. I'm also surprised that prime money market mutual funds did not break the buck. 

Anyway, is there any way we can trust the moneymarket-like ETFs like ICSH or JPST at this point?  It seems like money markets are being funded by the Fed right now, but I'm not sure if there's a way to really know if excessive risk is still there. I do not want to risk dollars to make pennies.

How are these firms with huge debt going to compete? In the case of airlines discount competitors were popping up all the time. If the same holds true post recession (or whatever it becomes) the existing players will basically be completely underwater on their assets and their debt. Boeing could now be making deals to produce planes for players that don't need to pay crews or maintainance until after this is over. Everything suggests they will face stiffer competition post recession.

In short I see firms like this being made uncompetative by the cost of servicing their debt - there will be competitors who lack these problems. The barriers to entry (asset prices, gate access fees) will also be reduced by this situation.

The same thing goes for other sectors. How is this debt not been seen as lethal to the firm's taking it on?"

368,t3_gdjhpc,investing,Rate these 2 Portfolios: Actively managed vs Passively managed,"Hello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs. I've done quite a bit of research and arrived at these portfolios for long term dividend growth + yield.  I have a pretty long investment time horizon so there's essentially no bonds. I live in Canada, and like to take advantage of tax benefits such as the Canadian Dividend Tax Credit, which is why my portfolio is Canadian focused.

Due to recent events and quantitative easing by the Fed, I am worried about the stock market trading sideways for a long time similar to the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Therefore, I believe a dividend/yield focused portfolio provides a steady source of growth in the absence of capital appreciation.

One of these portfolios seeks higher yield using actively managed strategies (such as artificial intelligence via HAL.TO), while the other portfolio seeks to minimize MER. I will list them below and briefly explain my rationale:

# Portfolio 1 (Actively Managed):

* CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (RIT.TO) - 40% allocation
* Horizons Canadian Active Dividend ETF (HAL.TO) - 30% allocation
* BMO Global High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.717%

**Rationale:**

I know the management fee is high, but if you check the annualized performance since inception of RIT.TO and HAL.TO, they are 9.20% and 7.27%. I know passive management generally beats active management, but in this case it might be different. Real estate is generally a sector where active management can provide more value than in stocks, due to more inefficiencies to exploit. HAL.TO uses artificial intelligence and big data to predict dividend yield and sustainability, which seemed to have provided superior returns so far.

Plus, the real estate market might be in big trouble, so the active management of RIT.TO might be useful to implement proactive/defensive plays. It's also interesting HAL.TO positioned it's allocation to utilities as its top sector allocation, since utilities tend to perform the best during a market downturn.

In terms of BMO covered call ETF, I see it as a pseudo-bond that provides good yield even in economic downturns. I chose ZWG.TO because it is geographically diversified compared to the other BMO covered call ETFs. I've heard good things about ZWH.TO (USA only), because the covered call premiums are higher in the US (though ZWG.TO is almost 60% US).

# Portfolio 2 (Passively Managed):

* Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO) - 40% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV.TO) - 30% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Global Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.258%

**Rationale:**

These are the lowest fee ETFs I could find compared to similar competition. I personally really like REITs which is why I am so heavy in real estate, and VRE.TO is the cheapest compared to other REIT etfs like XRE.TO and ZRE.TO. I also like the MSCI High Dividend Yield Indices that XDIV.TO and XDG.TO tracks, which uses smart beta methods (Tangerine's high dividend mutual fund also tracks this index).

400,t3_gd82oc,investing,My stock study watchlist. would appreciate criticisms or red flags,"**Core**

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion.

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closely watching**

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product.

\- Visa

They make a ton of money on transactions. I saw them hiring for blockchain development so it leads me to believe that they're adapting.

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

403,t3_gd7hyk,investing,daily swims during crash/historical data,"I'm sure the landslide from Feb 20 - March 23 this year is still fresh in everyone's mind. 

I sat that one out because i was still working during that time and knew even less about stocks/trading than I do now(still new to this and learning), but I saw the profits you can make by buying puts at the right time. 

one of the strategy I saw some people using during that time was buy puts on the green days and take profit immediately the day after. I still remember the market was ""predicable"" in the sense that everybody know it's crashing, and those greens days are almost guarantee to be followed with bloodbath red days after. That pattern repeated over the course of bit over 3 weeks.

Now my question is : is this a common characteristic for a steep market drop? I'm only taking about the big plunge here. In the past historical charts when you see the market take a nose dive, it's basically a straight line heading down, but I can imagine it wont red days for weeks straight, it will probably have some strong green days mix with every 2/4 red days? 

anybody here is old/experienced enough to remember the crash during 2008? or even black monday back in 1987 ? 

I wouldnt post this and get shit on for asking dumb questions but most website dont really show you daily detail for the index, especially when it's so long ago.

407,t3_gd2xcj,investing,Market Movers,"Last week was mixed with positive and negative drivers for the market, but it closed with a devastating statement by Warren Buffett that will likely drag down next week's markets: ""The world has changed...and I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way"".

Here are the details:

Better than expected earnings reports from tech and airline companies. This week began with strong earnings reports by Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), United Airlines (UAL), and others, demonstrating that analyst expectations for COVID-19's impact on the markets were overstated. Markets rallied on these strong earnings reports.

Gilead (GILD) announced a successful COVID-19 treatment and is making it widely available for free. Mid-week, GILD announced a successful phase 3 trial for remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir's ability to reduce hospital stays to &lt;2 weeks for over 50% of patients. The drug gained FDA approval for emergency use and will be available to COVID-19 patients for free beginning next week. This event was another positive driver in the markets last week. 

Amazon (AMZN) profits dip due to coronavirus response, even though revenue grew by 27% since last year, disappointing investors. AMZN share price decreased by \~8% from the beginning of the weak as it posted earnings 20% lower than analyst expectations. Bezos told investors that the increase in expenses were from spending millions on developing COVID-19 tests to test all its employees and implementing enhanced cleaning techniques to prevent COVID-19 spread.

Warren Buffett sells all airline shares as he is uncertain what society will be like coming out of COVID-19. Warren Buffett announced he sold all his airline shares because he is uncertain about society after the COVID-19 crisis. Buffett stated with uncertainty, “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. I don’t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.” This announcement may have a rippling effect on the market as many investors deem Buffett as an ""oracle,"" able to see the future of markets.

Overall, I’m optimistic about the economic recovery once stay-at-home declarations have been lifted. Protests across the country indicate unrest that is associated with lack of employment and the inability to move freely. Gilead's remdesivir brings a sense of security to economic opening as it may save many at-risk, severe patients from death. The virus is a transient event that will leave as quickly as it came."
408,t3_gd0iyp,investing,Why I think $opk will double in the next few weeks," Before I lay out a BUY thesis, let me first address the negativity:

* ""It's a penny stock"" - No it's not. The last closing price is $2.13 with a market cap of $1.43b. Widely spoken $nat ($6/share) here is under a billy.
* ""It's a pump and dump"" - No it's not. 39.85% insiders + 26.36% institutional holdings. You should realize that when dumb money from Robinhood follows anything in \~$1bil range, it's gonna move prices temporarily.
* ""The CEO was caught for pump &amp; dump"" - Sure, but not really. The CEO is an old Pharma billionaire. All the previous pharma companies he touched turned into gold. He owns 33.86% of Opko and continues to buy $100k+ worth of shares on every damn dip. Sure, he may have done some sketchy stuff on the side, but most of his wealth came from building empires. For the allegation btw, he got away with only [$5.5 mil](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/28/biotech-billionaire-philip-frost-agrees-to-proposed-judgment-in-sec-case.html)
* ""It's heavily shorted"" - Sure, 25.14% of the float is shorted, but I'm here to tell why shorts are about to get squeezed.

Buy Thesis. Not like I have much experience, but I've never seen a company this undervalued. Why?

* Testing, Testing, Testing. #1 reason to buy Opko is that it fully owns - Bioreference Labarotories - top 3 largest commercial labs in US (Quest &amp; LabCorp are two others). Drugs like remdesivir will come and go, but until universal vaccine rolls around, (which is mid to end 2021) people will need to get tested and retested to prevent the spread. Two weeks ago, BioRef's tests accounted for [20% nationwide](https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-pascrell-call-on-trump-admin-to-provide-greater-support-to-commercial-labs-testing-for-covid-19). That was when they were doing 15k tests/day. Two days ago on CNBC (yes, that alone should pump the price on Monday), the CEO said hey will be at [40k tests/day very soon](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) . [600k tests](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) performed already in the past 7 weeks at an average of 12.2k/day. Imagine a minimum of 50 more weeks at 40k/day. The demand is enormous. All of BioRef's testing cites are contracted. [Rite Aid](https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news/-/pressreleases/news-room/2020/rite-aid-expands-covid-19-on-site-testing-24-locations-now-open-across-eight-states), [pretty much most of New York,](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/380/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-nyc-health) [New Jersey](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/381/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-state-of-new), [Detroit](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/382/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-city-of-detroit), [Miami](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/383/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-and-city-of-miami).
* [Abbot's 5 min ](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html)[test](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/05/01/getting-covid-19-tests-where-they-need-to-be.html) is not highly accurate. Also, it alone can't sustain the demand for all of US because it's simply not profitable for Abbot to mass-produce expensive device that is only useful for a year. For starters, BioRef doesn't sell test kits. They make money by putting swabs in your nose and analyzing those results.
* You know what else you heard: antibody tests. Guess what, BioRef can do that too. On the CNBC interview, he mentions that by mid-May, they'll be at 400k antibody tests a day. You know what all that means??
* Revenue!!! Numbers aren't public so best we can do is conservative ballpark. $25\*400K/day = $10mil/day for antibody + $50\*40k/day for conventional = $2mil/day. **$12 mil for a min of 300 days is $3.6 billion** **in revenue**. Opko as a whole did $902 million last year. 80% of the revenue comes from [BioRef](https://www.opko.com/investors/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0000944809-20-000007/0000944809-20-000007.pdf). Plus it's doing a bunch of other stuff like 4k score, [Rayadale](https://www.opko.com/what-we-do/our-research/rayaldee), and long-awaited [Samotragon trial results due in June](https://www.opko.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/386/somatrogon-phase-3-pediatric-trial-results-will-be).
* The stock closed at $2.13 on Friday. When the announcement of testing came out in early March, it was pumped from $1.5 to almost $3 in 3 days. It was later dumped and shorted even more to an all-time low of $1.11. Now it's making an aggressive comeback. The stock was as high as $19.2 in mid-2015. Partial reasons for the decline from the highs were unsuccessful trial results and pump&amp;dump allegations I mentioned above. But **primarily**, shorts thought that Phil Frost buying BioReference Labs for $1.47 billion was unjustified. Two other competitors $DGX and $LH are $15 billion each. Now it's paying dividends. Never bet against an experienced Pharma Billionaire who has a third of his net worth in Opko.

TLDR: Buy shares or September (decently liquid) calls on $opk before earnings on May 6th.

This has essentially been true for going on a century now, and this has also been true in most real estate markets in the U.S. . For some reason, I'm starting to think that won't remain true.     I could be wrong folks, but there's something in my gut that says the future is going to be a lot worse in terms of making general market investment gains compared to what they have been over the past 50-75 years.  My reasons are based on the following, 

1. We have way too much debt.  I don't need to tell you this, but our debt to GDP is over 100% and rising fast.  With this virus and trillions in stimulus/bailout money, it's bound to get a lot worse.  Not only that, this country is saturated with person debt I.E. student loans, credit cards, and loans up the ying-yang 

2. People aren't having nearly as many kids as they used to.  In fact I'm a typical example of a male millennial that has no desire to try and raise a child. 

3. The U.S. is becoming too unstable of a society due to political problems I.E. corruption at all levels of government even at the state, city, and local levels.  

&amp;#x200B;

4. This virus just made this whole situation a lot worse, but it might have been bound to happen eventually anyway.  The virus though is very unpredictable.  Even **Warren Buffet** was saying he is pulling out of airlines.    


What I'm saying is the market could go down, and it might not recover for DECADES!  If you think that's impossible look at Japan.  Their stock market capped out in the late 1980s and to this day they have never fully recovered the losses!  The reason being is Japan is saturated with debt, and the population there hasn't increased much at all.    

&amp;#x200B;

I know what a lot of you are thinking, ""Well Japan is just a small island compared to the U.S."" I get that, but I don't think that it can't happen here.  In fact, I think it could happen within the next 10 years easily if it's not happening already.  So to make a long story short,  the mantra of: ""All you have to diversify in something like an index based fund and if you wait long it'll always go up more if it goes down as long as you can just wait about 2-5 years tops is not necessarily true!   There  are no guarantees like that.

&amp;#x200B;

415,t3_gcwd0a,investing,Robert Shiller and beating the market long term.,"Ok, so with the rise of ETF investing and many different ""Robo"" investing platforms available today, a lot are offering the same thing.

I found this video interesting:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-A7eCUrYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn-A7eCUrYk)

At the 3:45 minute mark, he uses the example of just doing a value investing strategy for most individuals and over the long term value invest will beat the overall market.  Anyone have any personal opinions about this?

I think what he's saying is that say you took allocations from these major robo investing companies and instead of going into a Total market large cap fund, say for 40% (or whatever allocation the benchmark is) and put it into a ""Total Value Large Cap Fund"", then over the next say 30 years, you would beat the market.  Then replace Small Cap allocation with Small cap value ETF etc.

Does anyone think this is true?  I've never studied the statistics for this or maybe Value over the long run just got lucky and the next 100 years will be different.

Any one have thoughts on this?"
416,t3_gcv79c,investing,Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator is Kinda Wrong. More like incomplete,"Over the past few days I’ve encountered several articles mentioning the Buffett indicator and how it’s flashing red, signaling dire times ahead. For those of you that don’t know, the Buffett indicator tells investors whether the stock market as a whole is overvalued relative to GNP or not. For the past few months and years, it has been signalling that the stock market is deadly overpriced, reaching significantly higher than the Great Financial Crisis in the past few months. I think it’s missing one piece of information that makes it seem slightly more worse than it seems.

The Buffett indicator is simply the Total Stock Market Capitalization/Gross National Product (GNP). GNP is quite similar to GDP, with net property income from abroad added to the mix. For the US, this doesn’t add much of anything, only about a 1-2% change from GDP.  The more interesting part is the market capitalization of the stock market. In the US it is usually measured by the Wilshire 5000 Full Cap Price Index or a similar all-encompassing index. 

[https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php). 

In the link above, you’ll see that the Buffett Indicator is currently at around 132% (as of the time of writing this). This nets it a value above 120% - which is meant to be the “significantly overpriced” territory. Looking at the chart provided in the link, we see that the market has been in that significantly overpriced territory since the start of 2017 and has continuously risen until the coronavirus led market crash. 

As explained in the link, the lines in this calculation are drawn around a one to one ratio between market capitalization and GNP. I’d like to note here the underlying assumption behind the indicator: The real value of the market capitalization should be around the same size of GDP.  This assumption, as far as I can tell, doesn’t hold any meaning over the long term. 

Think about it, this means that the value of the stock market should always stay constant with respect to the size of the economy. How could that be true, when the companies represented in the stock market have been growing their international customer bases while the rest of the economy hasn’t, meaning their growth relative compared to the stock market companies' growth is smaller. Shouldn’t we expect that over time, especially over the past 10 years with the widespread use of the internet, large companies have grown beyond their usual reach and come to represent a larger chunk of GDP than they used to?

To verify this claim, one would need to get their hands on data that shows the contributions of companies represented in the stock market to overall GNP. If there is a rise in that value as I suspect there is, this would mean that the Buffett Indicator needs to be modified by using the total contribution to GNP by stock market companies instead of GNP directly. 

I’d like to note that I have no idea if what I suggest here is true, or if I'm missing something blatantly obvious. But to me it stands clear that there should be a coefficient associated with this indicator that represents the relative size of stock market contributions to GNP vs GNP itself. Otherwise, the underlying assumption is too heavy to hold true over long periods of time. With that said, the actual value of the Buffett indicator should be significantly lower than it is today, to reflect the rise in stock market generated GDP over the past 10 years."

I think I understand the very basics, but nothing more than that, here's what I know and please correct me if I'm wrong so I can understand better. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

So if a buyer of a CDS has the ""spread"" on the CDS tighten that means that they would be paying the seller of the CDS less of a premium, but the CDS asset itself would be depreciate in value since default of the underlying asset is less likely. Then on the flip side if the CDS spread widens then the buyer is paying a higher premium to the seller, but the underlying asset of the CDS is more likely to default and the CDS becomes more valuable to the buyer. In that case the seller would ideally like to redeem (buy back) the CDS so they don't have to pay out in the underlying asset actually defaults. 

Do I have most or any of that right?"

433,t3_gck158,investing,"The theory behind CapEx, Buybacks, and Dividends","I’ve seen a lot of posts recently about buyback and dividends, especially about the discussion of buybacks in the media, so I figured I’d explain some of the theory, or at least how I learned it, behind the signals they are meant to give investors when used by a company. 

Assume a company has extra cash: they have 3 options with how they can spend it depending on how they view the company, the industry they’re in, and how the market is valuing the company (technically 4 with debt repayment, but that doesn’t really drive shareholder value). 

If they think there’s a lot of growth potential they’ll use that money on CapEx, M&amp;A, R&amp;D, and other things to help the company grow. This signals they think they can grow investors money more than those investors could elsewhere. If they have more cash, or don’t see as much growth in their industry they might turn to share buybacks or dividends. 

Dividends are a signal that they think investors can create a greater return elsewhere than they can in the company (or at least are giving them the option to chose if they can since you can always reinvest) [aside, but this is why you may want to be cautious of investing in companies with high dividend payout ratios since they’re literally telling you you have better options]. 

Buybacks signal the opposite, they are the company telling the market “You aren’t seeing our value, so the best thing we can do for our investors is buy ourself since we’re so cheap”. Theoretically a company would do this only until they though they were getting a good deal. 

The commentary is then for all these companies doing large scale buybacks, “Did they actually think their best option was to invest in the company, or were they just buying back shares to inflate share prices more?” That’s a really hard to answer since the company technically knows better than us how they’re valued, but it’s also kinda shady when companies are systematically buying back shares every year at peak multiples. 

This all being said, if a company is buying back shares during a huge down market it’s a good sign they’re undervalued. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."

personally i do not think that we will see another sell off until Q3

Q3 is the only earnings that can possibly surprise investors, everyone already knows that Q2 will probably be one of the worst earnings reports in the history of the stock market

what no one expects is earnings to be bad for Q3, everyone thinks a rebound will happen with positive earnings and well be set in an official bull market after Q3

because of this im fully bullish up until right before earnings of the big companies

i will be buying at lows for any company expecting a bounce up for everything, sure we might see some sideways trading or even small dips but i do NOT think that we will touch March lows until Q3 and that is ONLY if we have a bad Q3 earnings

think about this how you want, but all the signs are there

J. Powell literally said they have enough money to prop the market up for at minimum a year and they will do anything and everything in their power to keep the economy up

If you all have your bias' towards a bear sell off then fine everyone has their reasons

but thinking about ""where were supposed to be"" is a great indication of where the market is going.

everyone keeps thinking that we should be at ATLs right now because of unemployment and business' shutting down, but if we were gonna be there we should've been there by now

my best advice, buy at weekly lows for any company and hold and then just dollar cost average if it dips

were going to hit SPY 300 faster than everyone thinks and once we pass that threshold we might test it again as support but i really think were more than likely gonna keep going up

I can easily see SPY hit 400 over 220 by end of year

thoughts?

TL;DR - real recession will happen in Q3 when earnings are expected to rebound and be positive. Q2 earnings being ""bad"" are already priced in unless they are really REALLY bad. everyone knows theyre going to be bad. Q3 is the only thing i can thin of that will surprise investors if its a bad earnings which can start the sell off again and possibly new lows. Im bullish until Q3. Buying at weekly lows and DCA'ing if lower."

A lot of investors (particularly buy-and-hold ones) believe ""selling at a loss"" is a sign of defeat and that loss realization is somehow detrimental to their long-term earnings, and that eventually things will go back up to break-even. 

I see ""you haven't lost anything until you sell"" posted all the time, as if somehow your unrealized loss is not a real loss, and holding is the best approach by default.

This leads investors not to fundamentally reassess the opportunity costs of what they hold, holding and hoping they can break even... someday. Only when things are to a bleak point where they are trying to salvage anything they can do they sell.

Whether a loss is realized or unrealized is irrelevant to the fact that the value today is what your value is today. Using that same monetary value, would you buy the same stock at current valuations and future predictions? If not, what the hell are you still holding for? Why not sell now and buy what you would have bought with that money, if it has a better chance of offsetting your losses long-term?"

452,t3_gce9bg,investing,Another global conflict is more likely than most realize,"COVID-19 will have lasting effects geopolitically. In particular, China and the East Asian pacific. The pandemic has worsened already frayed relations between China and the US. This will accelerate manufacturing outside of China, but this was going to happen anyway as China transitions to a service economy. However, the US and other countries are taking provocative actions by supporting Taiwanese independence, probably to distract their population from their own failures at home in containing the outbreak. China has made it clear that Taiwanese independence will trigger an invasion from the mainland. This is not surprising since Taiwan is essentially China's Cuba, and any hostile nation so close to the mainland is a huge national security threat for them. 

I don't rule out the possibility of U.S. formally recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation; in fact the Trump administration is so edgy that I think this is likely if he gets a second turn. If Taiwan declares independence, either by the U.S. formally recognizing them, or them declaring it themselves, mainland China will likely retaliate militarily and launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan.

The second possibility is severe economic sanctions on China. There has been some discussion of this at the political level, but this will not ""make China behave"" as some would think, but make China more aggressive militarily. This would be similar to the US oil embargo on Japan in the 1940s. An isolate country with a worsening economy will have no choice left but to launch all out war in order to keep legitimacy.

Some people say, since China has nukes that a U.S.-China hot war is impossible. However, I do not buy that. If you look at China's nuclear capabilities, they have nowhere near the capabilities of the U.S. or the Russians. China can nuke Japan and Hawaii but I doubt they will be able to nuke much of the U.S. Whereas U.S. has complete nuclear superiority over China and can nuke them several times over.

I strongly believe that U.S. will have a ""hot war"" with China in &lt;= 10 years. How would this affect global markets?"

Is there a bond (fund) that provides steady, set returns, even if the interest rate is a bit less? Or goes up during stock market corrections. (I don't want to buy VIX.) Should I be looking at preferred shares of a stock? CDs? T-bills? High yield savings accounts? Something else entirely?

456,t3_gcc06x,investing,1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments going into the COVID-19 crises.,"I think a big assumption in the V-shaped recovery theory is that the U.S. economy was relatively healthy going into the crises. And that once demand returns to normal, businesses will continue to post record high profits. 

This idea couldn't be farther from the truth. [Data published in the WSJ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/) on March 10, 2020 showed that: 

* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. 
* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher. 
* [the IMF conducted a stress test](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/investing/corporate-debt-coronavirus/index.html) that showed an economic crises half the size of 2008 would put 40% of corporate debt at risk of default in the 8 of the largest world economies.

I find it very odd that stories like these were EVERYWHERE in March, 2020. Then as stocks began to skyrocket and firms started making back losses, they practically vanished from the media. 

If you are comfortable with these debt levels and believe we can keep increasing debt without a market contraction, then by all means continue to invest. Just wanted to get the information out since I haven't see much of this lately."

461,t3_gcawmd,investing,Thoughts on Equity Valuations and Why They Should Be Higher,"These are two primary reasons why I believe market P/E ratios have to be higher today than in the past. Comparing the P/E ratio of today and decades of the past is almost like comparing apples and oranges for the following reasons:

(1) **Free Put Option** is ignored by P/E ratios. When you buy the S&amp;P 500, you’re also getting an embedded put option provided by the Fed and US Treasury. If market conditions get worse, these entities will support risk assets through liquidity (Fed) and deficit spending (Treasury). This idea about the free put option has been around since 2009-2010, but it has been further qualified with recent actions. The repo market problems we saw in 2019 showed the Fed will step in even when stocks are at all-time highs! This put option has only increased in value since the GFC b/c the magnitude and frequency of support is very high. This put option won’t always exist, but should as long as fiat currency is accepted, the USD is the world reserve currency and the Fed’s measures of inflation don’t go meaningfully above 2.5% to 3%.

(2) **Free Cash Flow and Low LT Rates – Tech Wins**. The foundation of asset valuation is the value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows. When discounting future cash flows, the US 10-year has gone from 2-3% in recent years to 0.61% which increases the PV. You all know that. What a lot of people haven’t picked up on yet is free cash flow profiles differ substantially across industries and companies. If a company doesn’t generate much FCF, their firm valuation does not benefit from low long-term rates as much. Compare and contrast the cash flow statements of Exxon and Visa. Visa’s cash flow generation is nothing short of exceptional, and Exxon’s is poor. A lot of tech generates a ton of FCF and their P/E and EV/EBITDA valuations are very high, but I’d argue those aren’t really the best methods of valuing them because it doesn’t credit them for their best attributes, which is crazy cash flow generation. Discounted Cash Flow is the purest form of asset valuation.

Technology has become a very large part of the market today. These tech behemoths (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, V) generate crazy amounts of cash. Their cash flow statements are beautiful. A P/E ratio reflects accounting earnings, and does not measure true free cash flow which is the purest form of asset valuation. There may be a better example, but in 2019 XOM had $10.6B of Net Income and $5.3B of Free Cash Flow (Cash from Operations minus Capex). In 2018, V had $10.8B of Net Income (same as XOM in 2019) but had $12.2B of Free Cash Flow. There is a big difference and cash is king.

Question: The German 10-year Bund is -0.59%, so why aren’t European equities higher? Look at the composition of the European stock indexes – can you name any great European tech company? Maybe SAP? Dassault Systemes is basically the most US-like tech company in Europe and it stock has been great, but there is basically nothing else. Europe does have great pharma companies that generate cash flow but they all have very little growth. Europe has hardly any free cash flow growth and that is what low long-term rates love.

\#1. Free Cash Flow matters a lot more than EPS. #2. Growth in tech w/in the S&amp;P 500 has led to more cash flow generation than we’ve seen historically, so P/E should be higher. #3. Low interest rates benefit FCF generation through DCF models. Bottom line, traditional equity valuations are higher b/c of these market realities."
462,t3_gcaw94,investing,Airline stock strategy. I would like to hear your thoughts,"Here's my theory:

Major airlines are going for 1/3 of that they were usually going for.  UAL is going for $26.00 a share when it was going for $75 just a few months ago.

Let's say I have $30,000 to invest.  I put $10,000 into 3 different airlines:

10k in UAL, 10k in LUV, 10k in Delta.

Worst case scenerio 2 airlines go bk, but 1 goes back to it's original price.  That means I will totally break even and not lose anything.  (I can't see all 3 major US airlines going BK).  If anything, the remaining ones will eat up the other ones market share.

Medium case scenerio:  1 airline goes BK, the other 2 go back to their normal price.  In that case I made a decent profit.

Best case scenario: No airline goes BK, and all 3 return to their normal price, and I just tippled my investment.

What are your thoughts.  This strategy seems like a very safe bet to me."

When was panic at it's highest? Early March, that's when people acted on emotion and pulled out to play sidelines.

I think the fall were starting to see is the money that had no where to go (which in previous recessions people just sat on, but now that everything including gambling on stocks is more accessible there is a ton of free cash in the market right now) currently propping up this bull run that doesn't make sense is going to exit back into brick and mortar as the economy re opens. Now this goes either way depending on how it goes.

If it goes well we see a small climb in the first month on optimism, then an exit as money circulates in the actual economy again, and we see a return to a ""new normal"" low level. Bear view

If it doesn't go well money re enters we see another massive bull run followed by another crash. Bull view, then we cycle back into trying to reopen again.

467,t3_gc7scb,investing,Tanker stocks STNG vs NAT and Clean vs Crude,"
A lot of you are going to miss the boat on NAT (get it?). Here’s why:

Rates for shipping CLEAN product (refined gasoline, naphtha, jet fuel) are showing to be way more stable and are currently, insanely high vs DIRTY (crude oil) shipping rates. We are talking around 10x/day.

What does this mean? Crude oil shipping rates are still very high comparatively to last year, but are far below what clean rates are as of right now. 

Also, the fundamentals of NAT vs other tanker stocks just suck. There are far better options in the tanker world that will hold value better long term. NAT is among your worst options. 

The clean tanker stock that I think is poised to rally hard is $STNG. They have 42 LR2 ships in their fleet who are exposed to the most insane rates of all of the ship types currently. Their fleet is also modern and new. Refined products seemed to have backed up harder than crude meaning there is more need for storage on the water and shipment to terminal locations. It has dipped enough in the past week to make it a hell of a buy just before their earnings on 5/6. Q1 will be solid, but Q2 guidance should be
crazy appetizing as they are hopefully locking in these LR2 rates now.

I’m much more bullish on the tanker stocks with clean tankers. With that said, I am to the moon with STNG, long on EURN, DSSI and INSW.

EDIT: Lots of other variables at play here including the age of the fleets, order book for construction of new ships (hint: order book is very low so ship availability will become more scarce over time, good for rates) etc. Clean rates will most likely come down to lesser levels, but many experts seem to agree that the average rates for 2020 will be extremely good compared to recent years. STNG seems to be the play with lottery ticket upside and the others I listed are just fundamentally good stocks to buy and hold during this time."

* Buffett will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually on Saturday, starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
* Berkshire’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by unrealized losses in the massive stock portfolio.
* Berkshire bought $1.8 billion of stocks on a net basis in the period as the market plunged amid widespread fallout from Covid-19.
* Berkshire took a more cautious approach to stock buybacks in the first quarter, repurchasing just $1.7 billion. It spent a [record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-22/buffett-spends-record-2-2-billion-buying-up-berkshire-shares) $2.2 billion on buybacks during the last three months of 2019.

So The Fed is cutting interest rates and doing QE to encourage lending and trying to maintain liquidity in the credit market. This drives down the yeilds on basically everything. There was been a pretty consistent downward trend in 10Y Treasuries since 2001 (maybe even earlier?).

10Y Treasuries had 5% yields when folks were experiencing the 2008 crash. Am I right in assuming that investors back then may have been more likely to rebalance their portfolios into safer assets because yields were still semi attractive, over just holding cash or equities?

For example:
if I buy a 100$ stock at a 4:1 leverage and it goes up by 10% on day one then it becomes 140$ I guess.
Then on day two it goes down by 20% so the 140$ become 60$ because of the 4:1 ratio
Does it work that way?

or is it so that if I buy at 100$ and after going up and down after a month it's gone up by 50% so at 4:1 leverage it's a 200$ increase?

what I mean is : does the leverage only take effect at the time of selling?

Ok, so, I get it, market is at recent lows and now you want to jump in. Smart. Well played...oh wait, this doesn't look like a 001 econ class chart, etc etc etc. I'm not here to beat you down. You were right to believe now is the time to buy, but all of the  crazy confusion can be a bit well, confusing. Also, if you feel like it, cross post this to whatever Tatooine-esque investing sub you like. It will save me some trouble.

1. Do not start investing in the hopes for short term gain on the backbone of a knowledge base that's as flimsy as jello. Seriously. I put this #1 because it should be the most over pronounced the few of us that are well versed should be repeating at all times, regardless of it not getting all the sexy upvotes of a market slander / confusion post...why?
2. Most people that make short term profits in this are lucky, or have extensive education, training, professional experience watching economic activity. Seriously. This is why I am putting this second. Joe regular, having whatever non-business / economics background is not on the same ground that people with a well versed background. On the internet, you're not going to be able to tell people apart immediately, and ""free"" advice is everywhere.
3. If you don't fall into #1 or #2, go long always. Invest in high quality firms with strong financials. Names you know. Make a buy, and sit on it forever or until you want to cash out. OR, pay a professional. There generally isn't a comfortable middle ground (sure, exceptions). Don't do this when the economy isn't on the news every night...do do this, if you can, when the economy is the forefront. Good news hardly makes nightly news, bad news always does. If your gut tells you that times are tough, but you have extra, that's when you should look into the bigger names...but this won't always work...why...
4. If you cannot lose as much as you put in, don't. Just don't. Even for the best of us this is a well placed bet. There is no guarantee. Stop. Invest in a 401k with a strong fiduciary. A well managed mutual fund. Please help yourself and do not start using an app that doesn't base itself on constant deposits and steady investment. Investing is good, within reason. Bad investing is essentially gambling addiction. Call the same number, talk to someone. There are prominent media figures right now, from fairly popular sports networks, just making click money on being bad at this. Those people can afford to loose money, a lot of people cannot. If you cannot, go long, go diversified, pay someone.
5. I cannot overstate how much experience matters. I was going to wrap this up, but it had to be said. If you failed out of math, economics, etc...just stop. Pay someone. Being able to watch a trend in real time isn't for everyone. Knowing economic indicators, geopolitics, and cyclical business schedules matters. In the short-term it matters a lot. I make money swing trading market trends, on top of playing standard long positions. I can do that because I can absorb a variety of information and know what to do with it. Seriously, 3 media inputs and flat numbers. I cannot overstate how much most people should make safe bets long.

And that's that, for now. I may cross-post on my own, but have just wanted to get that out. I'm sure it will get lost in the shuffle, but after everything I've read across multiple subs, I mean... why not."
493,t3_gbzcfw,investing,Gold vs Bonds,I don’t see the point of owning bonds. The return rate is so low they barely beat inflation if that. A gold trust seems like a much better investment if you want to balance out your portfolio. Ray Dalio’s fund currently has 6% of its portfolio in a gold trust.

If you believe we have another 30% (or 15, or 20) to go down, but it plays out over a couple of months - what would be the hit to just leaving your money in the inverse given there will be days that are up 1-3% during the down leg. 

Obviously if you had a 2x or 3x, those few days in a row up could kill you, but I'm thinking the hit on a 1x wouldn't be that bad. If the cumulative decay/fees is 1-2% over 3-4 months of a 30% downturn, I can handle that."

I'm a new investor who decided to jump into the market a couple of days before this year's low, and I have invested just under £1000 in my portfolio in three blue chip companies. Anyway, I was just wondering what the point was in being able to buy shares of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and NASDAQ (NDAQ) themselves. It kinda doesn't make sense to me... if buying a stock means owning a share of a company, what do you own with the exchanges themselves and what is the incentive to buy?

500,t3_gbrx0r,investing,New Stock Strategy,"When I first began investing I started off with companies I was familiar to now many that are not as “mainstream”. Recently Ive adjusted my criteria to investing based on the stock’s dividend per share so that there is always something going back into the stock in conjunction with its eventual growth in the market. As a result, I’ve been readjusting my portfolio to invest in stocks that offer $0.70+ in dividend per share. That number came up based on past experiences, personal calculations, extensive research, etc. My portfolio has diversified significantly. 

What are your thoughts of my strategy?"
501,t3_gbrod2,investing,Investing in International,"I've read several times that the charts show that International stocks sometimes beat the return of the total US market and back and forth.. but when I chart it on portfoliovisualizer.. it definitely doesn't show that at all?  Any time the international goes up the SP500 is going up as well...

Inputting 40k which is roughly 20% of my total funds, the SP500 would have returned $238.4k since 1997 while VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock Index Admiral) Only returned $100k....

&gt;""The worst-case scenario is to increase your international allocation when international stocks are doing well (e.g. in 2017), and reduce your overseas exposure when the U.S. is outperforming.""

Even in 2017 when it did well.. SP500 performed the same margins if not better.

Is the reason for investing part of our stock in International just because of the chance International will do better one day?  Or is it kind of like a safety net if the US market goes to shit then we still have something invested in International?  

Also if someone can provide me examples of how the International Total market was doing better than the American Market .. that would be great because right now I'm not convinced.. but I""m new to this and I'm sure i'm not seeing it.  Thank you"

506,t3_gbq1rx,investing,Best method of long term investing on margin?,"Hey all, 

I've been interested in investing on margin for awhile. My thought process has mainly been, I should get into real estate because I see everyone making tons of money on it, mainly due to leverage. But then it seems like a lot of work and there's the opportunity cost of the down payment that could be in the market and REITs could basically be the same. So I say well really what I want I think is to just make money off loans to make more money. 

Anyway I'm dabbling in trading a little extra in VTI on margin. Low enough that I shouldn't get margin called, but high enough to hopefully increase my return in the long run a bit.

Looking around for best places and the best I've found is M1 finance with 2% if I get M1 plus for $125 a year. Only other similar ones were interactive brokers. I'm hoping to do like &lt;10% (probably &lt;5% to start) of my NW.

Any thoughts on the whole idea/my reasoning or if there are better ways to go about this? I've also heard of just investing in ETFs that are leveraged and you can avoid all this but idk much about that or if it has downsides. Thoughts?"

Stop talking about ""fed pumping"" as if we're going to crash down to SPY 150.

513,t3_gbn44o,investing,Thoughts on making a long term play on IBM with its new CEO?,"While many people are talking about Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in the cloud computing war, I think IBM could be the dark horse in the race.

He has a PhD in engineering and was the senior VP of cloud and cognitive software. He seems committed to artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain technology.

IBM has a strong balance sheet, moat, and dividend, it isn't going anywhere, and a P/E of 10.38.

&gt; Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

520,t3_gbmg4t,investing,New trader seeking advice. I took the time to write down my strategy. Please be harsh.,"I've been trading for about 3 months now, and really feel like I've found my calling.  I want to trade full time as a career eventually when I've built up enough capital.  
I've done a lot of due diligence and self-educating, and have formed some semblance of a strategy.  I've written down a list of rules that should never be broken, and that is the basis of my strategy.  I would love some feedback and advice from professionals.  I apologise in advance if I fail to use the proper terminology, or if I've posted in the wrong spot.  

1. Watch any stock with RSI 30 or less which is below both SMA20 &amp; SMA90.

2. Analyze the MACD to determine the momentum of a trend and the chance of reversal

3. Read the news to determine the stock isn't dead(filing for bankruptcy, about to be delisted, about to split, major scandal)

4. Take a position if the majority of analysts say to buy or hold.

5. Move into positions with an initial buy worth 0.5% of total portfolio value.
	
6. Aim for gains between 8-10% above avg price.  Once a stock price reaches 5% increase start to Set &amp; regularly maintain Stop Loss Sells to protect profits.

7. The maximum value of any position should not exceed 2% of your portfolios total value

8. First Double Down triggered @ 10% loss.  Stop Loss Sell @ 7% increase.  100+90=190÷2=95(avg price).  7% increase from 90 is 96.3
	
9. Second Double Down triggered @ 20% loss from first Double Down. Stop Loss Sell @ 17% increase. 100+90+72+72=334÷4=83.5(avg price).  17% increase from 72 is  84.2.
	
10. Final sell at a loss should be executed after 5% loss from second Double Down.

11. Dont touch anything that trades at a volume of less than 3 million.

12. Try to avoid holding positions over the weekend.  Even if you have to take a smaller gain or a shallow loss(1-3%) to get out before market hours on Friday, it is generally advantageous to do so.  (This rule is likely due to my own anxieties.  I'm happier when I have less money on the line during the weekend.  A lot of news can drop in that 2 day span between trading days.)

I've tried to set up these rules such that one follows the other (I wont be wasting my time reading news about the stock if it's trading above 30 RSI).  I am extremely conservative because I don't have a lot of capital and I desperately try to protect the small bit I do have(my initial investment was $500, and likely won't add more capital until after I've started working my regular job again).  I trade almost exclusively stocks listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or S&amp;P 500.  Sometimes I trade crypto, but only with extremely good indicators, as the extreme volatility scares me a little.  I stay the fuck away from options and futures.  I'm interested in the technicals of Forex, and am open to trading put options after I've sufficiently grown my account.

Please be as harsh as you can with your criticism without being unfair.  There is no room for feelings in this game, I know that.  I am trying to improve.

Thanks in advance for any and all feed back."
521,t3_gbm83s,investing,Gilead - a good investment? Phase III trials being expedited,"Gilead is promising.

I think the stock downturn today is mere facade with worries that this is not a ""cure"" or that the results were not the magic-bullet. I disagree. This medication will be prescribed everywhere as it reduced hospitalization by 1/3. Certainly more similar drugs will develop in due time but this is the first step. A Historic step.  That's a very important economic and healthcare space improvement. There was also a trend towards SS with overall survival and likely would have been met in larger numbers. With this all in mind and my own medical background, it appears obvious this is a good investment at least until the phase III publication.

This is the time to ride this wave. If the phase III results are published and lacking (doubt it) or a vaccine develops before the phase III publication, then jump ship. Gilead is the stock to hold for the next few months.

Lots of investing sites focus on financials, etc and have a little bit about the company profile, but missing a lot of information about their supply chain for example or about their customers. 

For example, with HTZ unless I go to their corp site , it's not clear that they have other rental car companies under their belt. What I didn't know until I read some news articles about them, was that part of their revenue is based on the sale of their used vehicle fleet. Also, it states that they sell Value Added Services, but what are those? I assume some could be insurance? If so, which company is providing insurance.

But while noticing that, I also noticed that BRK-A, which has tracked the S&amp;P 500 fairly closely in recent years has lagged in the last month of the recovery. BRK-A put in its all-time high close on the same day the market peaked (February 19) at 344k vs. 3386 for the market. However BRK-A is currently trading at 276k vs. 2843 for the market, which represents about a 3.5% under-performance, all of which accrued during the month of April.

528,t3_gbkm8k,investing,What am I Missing?,"So, BLDR released earnings yesterday in which they beat EPS projections by 21.43%, sales by 20million, and had organic growth of a little over 3% outside of acquisitions. Now what confuses me is that it went down today. Was this purely driven by the market?? This is the way I see it: They had equivalent EPS from Q1 2019 to now this Q1 2020. Not only did they meet/beat earnings, but these weren’t adjusted earnings from the virus. BLDR has maintained and grown from quarters before the virus. So if the stock was at $28 before the crash, and is now at $17, with it beating earnings and increasing sales from the numbers posted BEFORE the virus, why is the value not $28 or higher. Essentially this earnings showed that they haven’t missed a beat since the virus started. The only counter I could possibly think of is anticipation of next quarters results being low due to real estate lending companies not funding new projects, thus making the supply for BLDR’s goods decrease. I have a hard time believing that the day after a 21% earnings beat, people are already trading in anticipation of the next quarters earnings. And I don’t want to hear “well the 50% gain over this last week is the earnings being priced in” the reason this doesn’t work for me is as I mentioned above. Based off sales and book value, the company is unchanged if not better than when it was trading at $28"

533,t3_gbjltk,investing,"People who are looking for ""cheap"" stocks might consider IBM. They trade at 12x earnings, pay a ~5% dividend, and just acquired redhat recently","IBM has had basically flat (slight decline) revenues and profits for ~5 years, which is not quite the Tech stock headline we are used to seeing.  Market cap is 108bn today, revenues of 77bn in 2019, and earnings of 9.4bn. 

I feel they are integrated into so many business / government operations, that they will be reasonably well positioned during the covid crisis to continue to make money.  It is true that IBM will not be able to sell as many new services while its clients cost cut &amp; pause new investing. However IBM is a mature business - clients cannot easily switch products - and they will continue to earn from those.  

They are focused improving their hybrid cloud offerings and acquired redhat in July 2019 for 34bn, which at the time had growing earnings (3bn per year most recently), and growing revenues. Maybe IBM will screw up this trend, but hopefully not. Cloud provides some upside potential.

Even though we see some slight declines in earnings/revenues, IBM is still massively profitable, and I believe can eventually regain their footing through investment in R&amp;D or acquisition.  Having a lot of cash coming in is huge, because they can afford to make investments that many smaller contracting companies cannot.

IBM's global technology services (consulting, build, design, run) has been declining (9% YoY), which accounts for 60% of their revenue. However IBM is pretty well diversified in offerings, and will likely see other bets begin to offset this. Cloud is about 30% of their business and is growing at a 20% YoY rate.

IBM pays ~5.7Bn out in dividends of it's 9.7bn in earnings, so dividend is sustainable. I think for the price, IBM is a bargain.  It's not a trendy company, but it makes money and will continue to do so.

On the flip side, clear beneficiaries of the current upheaval are doing well. 

So while markets are not moving on real-time economic fundamentals, they are moving on reasonable judgements of fundamentals going forward

The Fed, for instance, is committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars of municipal bonds at favorable rates, which will mean that cash-strapped state governments should be able to retain teachers and policemen and programs

The Fed also is about to lend another $500 billion to Main Street businesses, which is coming too late to avoid the pain of the last month but will still matter greatly to the ability of companies to move forward and eventually rehire. The most visible effect of the money in motion now is the stock market, but that will be not the sole beneficiary as more Fed money flows to states and Main Street.

536,t3_gbj05i,investing,Crescita Therapeutics (CTX.TO) is your best bet for a Micro-Cap Healthcare Investment - Here is 5 reasons why.,"I've been mentioning this stock in a few threads recently, and a lot of people have asked why?   
A quick disclosure: I hold a medium size position in [CTX.TO](https://CTX.TO), purchased in mid-April at $0.47 per share. It currently sits at $0.70 per share, where I feel it still hold a lot of long term value.

* **Fundamentals are solid** \- P/E about 8 (ttm 5), P/S ans P/B under 0.5, D/E of 7. This is a company with almost no debt. They have 1.5M in debt, and over 9M in cash. 
* **Management are taking paycuts to maintain cash -** CEO, CFO, and other board members are taking paycuts up to 40% to help preserve cash. 
* **Jumping on the COVID help train -** CTX plans to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in May (oh hey, it's May now, look at that)
* **It's a penny stock that's actually low risk!? -** Yes! Penny stocks are notorious for having a high potential reward at a very high risk. It's easier for a stock to go from $0.10 to $0.20 than it is to go from $1000 to $2000. But it's much much much more likely that it goes to $0. Crescita Therapeutics  is a relatively new company, founded in 2016, that's already shown it knows how to function in the best and worst of times. They will not suffer long-term from the pandemic, as many penny stock companies and other micro-cap companies will.
* **It's an alternative industry in the sector at the moment -** Maybe you're getting tired of all the pot companies and COVID test stocks. Why not go with some beauty? When things start to return to some level of normalcy in the coming months/year, and COVID isn't the only thing in the news, stocks may drop. When people are working again, they may smoke less pot (but probably not, honestly). One thing is for sure though, people who buy beauty products, will still want to be beautiful, especially now that's they're going to see people again."
537,t3_gbitbe,investing,The case for shorting Intel.,"While Intel has had a great run over the past decade, I believe we've reached an inflection point. They've already had to start laying off employees: https://investorplace.com/2020/01/intel-layoffs-2020-things-to-know/

With AMD breathing down their back, Intel is lowering prices on their server chips lowering profit margins which won't be coming back anytime soon: https://www.anandtech.com/show/15405/intel-cuts-xeon-prices

Intel is constantly talking about how they're going to be shipping 7nm in 2021 when they have failed to get their 10nm process working for almost 4 years now past its original expected release date. It's clear Intel's process has stagnated, and their choice to stick with manufacturing their own CPUs has now turned from advantage to disadvantage as it's competitors are able to focus on design while leaving the process improvements to TSMC: https://www.pcworld.com/article/3394398/intel-commits-to-shipping-7nm-chips-by-2021-an-aggressive-change-of-pace.html

I'll be honest in saying that I'm probably somewhat biased here in that I don't trust business CEOs to know how to run a tech company properly. As an engineer, I know how important it is that you actually understand your products and the engineering that goes into CPU design, and so I prefer when the CEO actually has that capability.

Intel hasn't been run by an engineer for quite some time at this point. Just look at Intel's current CEO Bob Swan. He is literally the definition of the ""MBA business type executive"". We compare that to companies like AMD and Nvidia, which are both headed by strong technically minded engineers and the differences in management are like night and day.

All of these are reasons why I believe Intel has largely peaked as a company, and my thesis for why Intel is a good stock to go short on right now."

554,t3_gbbs8f,investing,How to Value Stock in a Time of COVID-19 (ELI5 Edition),"So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.

I would like to offer my explanation in regard to this. Since this is r/investing , i assume most of you guys have basic understanding in regard to FCF Valuation. But in case you don't know, it is pretty popular subject if you want to go deep down into fundamental investing. Some popular resources i would like to recommend is [Aswath Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), [Valuation by McKinsey](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/0470424656). Basically in FCF Valuation, you make an estimation in regard of future cash flow a company can generate in the future and discount it to the present time to arrive at the value of the business right now.

Since this is ELI5, i will not go into too much details. This is heavily dumbed down scenario, but i think it is enough to give you understanding.

Let's assume a **hypothetical company**. It is a good business with no debt, it has no risk of bankcruptcy in the near future.

Revenue = $1.000.000

Variable cost = 40% (this is the cost that incurred everytime you make a sale. Example : sales commision, product cost, delivery, etc.)

Fixed sot = $400.000 (this is the cost that incurred whether you make a sales or not. Example = Rent expense, salary, fixed assets depreciation, etc).

Net income = $200.000

The Value of the business is $2.000.000 (you can assume this is the market price, if someone actually want to buy the company).

For simplicity sake, we assume the net income is fully on cash-basis, so the net income also represent the free cash flow for the business. 

Assume that because of COVID-19, the revenue in 2020 will be down by as much as 50% and in 2021 will be down by 25%. It will go back to normal in 2022, so the terminal value or going forward it will go back to pre-covid value of $2.000.000

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
:--|:--:|:--:|--: |
Revenue | 500,000 | 750,000 | - |
Variable Cost| -200,000 | - 300,000 | - |
Gross Margin| 300,000 | 450,000 | - |
Fixed cost | -400,000 | -400,000 | - |
Net Income | -100,000 | 50,000 | - |
Terminal Value | - | - | 2,000,000 |
Discount factor* | 0.9090 | 0.8264 | 0.7513 |
Present Value | -90,909 | 41,332 | 1,502,629 |

*I use 10% Cost of capital. It is calculated simply by dividing 1/cost of capital^n . In this case 1/10%. This is pretty high as you might see, [a lot of business has lower cost of capital](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar). And lower cost of capital will result in higher present value.

If we sum all the present value (Net income/terminal value discounted into the present), it will arrive at $1,453,042, compared to previous value of $2,000,000. A 27% decrease in value, significant but arguably much more modest than many people would imagine.

Of course this is just hypothetical. But i would like to believe that my assumption is quite conservative. Like with the 10% cost of capital (even after the fed slash rate), or long U-shaped recovery. But if you try the FCF Valuation (the actual one, not this dumbed down version), you will see that the value will not go down as far as some bears like to believe. 

==========
**What we can take from this.**

Yes, time is bad and many good business will record very low or in fact negatives income this year. But this is not as doom and gloom as many people wanted to believe.

We see company like Adidas, Disney, Yum Brands penalized quite a bit because COVID, around the range of 25%-40%, depending on the timeline you are looking at, which is actually quite fair in regards to their future performances.

I knew at this point people have enough with priced-in, but yeah, the current price did in fact have priced in the COVID issue in their prices.

Just because a lot of unemployment and low revenue this year doesn't mean the value of the business will go down by as much as 50% or even lower. That's not how it works in regards to Value of a Business. 

Imagine if you have a good family business. This year will be rough, but you and your family have enough to keep everything a float. Some random investor comes in and said ""whew, bad times eh? Can i buy your business for 40% of its market price?""

If i were him, i will show them the exit door right away. Why would i sell it if i expect the business will recover in 2 years.

But actually there is a lot of stock right now facing this condition. Their stock are heavily penalized, and it is your job to find them and if you right, reaping the capital gain from them.

In regards to myself, two weeks ago I'm at 25% stock, 75% cash. But last weeks i decide to shift gear and move to 75% stock and 25% cash (I have to thanks [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos) for this). I left 25% just in case that I am wrong and market will drive even lower than this."

*One of their more recent &amp; great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of Jim McGowan as their Vice President &amp; Manager of VISL MiliGov division. This man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining VISL he was the vice president of FLIR systems, a company that has a $5 Billion dollar market cap. The recruitment of Jim McGowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to VISL.

*Their recent contract bids that have been accepted. Sure, you can go ahead and say it is a relatively small contract considering the industry they are in, but look at who they are contracted with. It's a small sheriff's department &amp; guess who got them the contract in the first place? **Jim McGowan**. This shows that despite the COVID-19 outbreak, this company is still putting in solid work &amp; after they complete this project, with the help of **Jim McGowan**, they will continue getting government and military contracts. He just barely joined at the end of March and won them this government contract.

*Their most recent bid was accepted, thus beating out all the other competitors. As many of you may have heard, VISL was chosen as the company to provide live high definition &amp; uninterrupted video board systems for the Ferrari race series. This is a prestigious contract, this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this. This shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology, we should too. This contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts.

*Alongside their most recent contracts, if you look their recent history YTD, they are all over the world winning government contract bids &amp; making a name for themselves. With most companies reporting loss in profits, VISL is working hard &amp; continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology.

This form is directly correlated to DEFA14A they filed on 4/21/2020 which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next Friday, May 8th. This goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news, possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the Ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on. Either way, the 8K filing should be good news next Friday.

*They currently have a Target price set at $1 and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of $10. I don't believe it will reach $10 on the next 12months, but I strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year.

At the end of the day, it's a relatively cheap stock, it's trading at 34 cents. You can buy 100 shares right now for 34 dollars right now. I personally bought 200 shares. Because if I'm worng, this will drop back down give or take .25 cents which is where I bought my 200 shares. But if I'm right, then I'll make solid profit. Because it's cheap, I'm okay with purchasing 200 shares.

it seems like we are headed in that route especially after Walmart's huge sell off recently

They're borrowing like crazy with the Fed rate at 0.25% and they're using that capital to pay down old, higher interest liabilities i.e. collectively, they're handing it back to the Fed. None of that looks good or sounds good from a short-term perspective; and little of that QE will actually hit mainstreet -- at least in the period when it matters. But paying off debt is the only way out of this spiral -- especially when investors are scared (saving vs spending mentality), credit risk is poor, and economic growth is stifled. This is a deflationary spiral that could last 3-5 years; and QE can only mask the bleeding so much before it becomes detrimental to our future. Just look at Japan in the 90's. You can't fight lack of demand without meaningful control of the price lever.

Point being, the following realities are inevitable:

* People will hoard the money supply
* Lending will freeze despite a near-zero interest rate
* Economic growth will be stifled as demand/investing remain low
* Most of the money supply will be spent on commodities and debt obligations
* New bubble will form when the real value of certain assets (housing etc.) gets distorted. This will also form the basis for our breakout

This is a **liquidity trap**. There will be a run on the market -- JPow has been printing to ""price"" all that in. For the past three weeks, the Fed has been acting as ballast to buy time for monetary policy to pivot. Now banks are in a strong cash position with foreknowledge of what to expect. So we should expect the floodgates to open and the carpet to finally get pulled. Stocks will crash again (hoarding cash), and harder; followed by a multi-year theta market marked by incremental inflation until we transition to a much needed growth period. Or we'll try and print our way to inflation -- with consumer spending as the operative variable.

Welcome to the debt bubble! FYI, whatever medicine we use to resolve this will ultimately form the cause of our next bubble. So on and so forth...

* Globalization created cheap external labor which spurred economic investment/growth. This bubble created wage imbalance
* Wage imbalance resulted in risky/unregulated/low interest lending which was a boon for big banks and consumer spending for nearly two decades. This bubble created debt
* Debt caused the mortgage crisis of 2008 which resulted in a massive recession second only to the Great Depression. This bubble created QE
* QE caused the liquidity trap of 2020 which resulted in a massive deflationary spiral akin to the recession. This bubble was created by excess and unnecessary money supply in a period of low demand
* Wage increase (through Federal stimulus check or other) will get us out of recession. But again, it will also form the cause of our next bubble.

Cash out high. Assets will be worth less than cash. Then pay down your debt or invest when we finally touch bottom. The environment looks exceptionally bearish for months and years to come. Everyone is scared to say liquidity trap because that will cause equities and lending to tank. But I encourage you to scream it."

They've opened up their stores in mainland China and Asia for full operations but clearly that wasn't going to change the fact that nobody wants to shop in this environment. They've had some problems integrating their Stuart Weitzman acquisition before the virus came around and the closures fared them no better. They drew down $700M of their $900M revolving credit agreement this past quarter through Bank of America and a few other banks (which, as long as they can maintain a consolidated debt plus 600% of consolidated lease expense to consolidated EBITDAR ratio of 4.00/1.00, once again BIG THANKS to /u/fuzzyblankeet for the r/wsb negative covenants run through you did, seriously guys if you haven't read his posts on $SEAS, $PLAY, and $F, **mandatory reading for learning about debt, the company should be fine as long as they can stay under that ratio)**. I'm bullish on this industry because realistically speaking people aren't going to stop their stupid spending habits and online sales helped stop some of the decline in store sales for TPR this past quarter. I don't like that they extend more credit to their customers than they receive in cash (this is what I got out of the negative change in accounts receivables for the most recent quarters, it tends to be negative, which means people are paying with credit and just paying it off slowly, which is probably endemic to the luxury goods industry, I'm going through Capri Holdings' 10-k also so I'm going to figure this out in more depth). Good work on the CEO for cutting dividends and buybacks quickly (these should be treats when the shareholders don't get in the way of the long term prospects of the company). The $700M is going to head towards operating expenses and working capital and so forth. I'm a shareholder and long $TPR for the record. I think the virus and recession we're in now is a blip.

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s engineering was supposed to
turn loans to junk-rated companies into relatively safe bonds
known as collateralized loan obligations. As the new coronavirus
slams the economy, some investors are finding that safety to be
fleeting.

Interest and principal payments are at risk of being cut
off for investment-grade CLOs in around a dozen different
transactions totaling a few billion dollars, according to people
with knowledge of the matter. The notes at risk have ratings as
high as the A tier, well within high-grade territory, and were
sold by name-brand money managers like Marathon Asset Management and Pretium Partners, the people said.

The securities are being battered as the Covid-19 pandemic
is bringing an economic downturn far worse than many CLOs were
designed to withstand, with some estimates for unemployment in
the second quarter reaching 30%. Loans are getting downgraded
and their value is dropping, which is triggering protections
designed to protect the safest securities issued by CLOs, those
rated AAA.

It’s the first time these safeguards, known as senior
overcollateralization tests, have been this widely triggered
since the 2008 financial crisis. Many more deals could meet the
same fate in the coming months. CLOs, a $700 billion market of
securities carrying ratings ranging from junk to AAA, were
largely left out of Federal Reserve stimulus programs.

“I don’t know anybody that modeled a CLO, or any other
structured product, around unemployment soaring from about 3% to the levels we could be facing in the next few weeks,” said Elen
Callahan, head of research at the Structured Finance
Association, a trade group. “If you told an analyst to model
that, they wouldn’t know what to do.”

The lowest-ranking securities sold by CLOs are most at
risk. Of the roughly 900 deals that have posted data over the
last month, around 21% have had cash payments cut down or cut
off from the riskiest portion of their deals, known as the
equity, according to Bank of America. In certain cases, junk-
rated notes, which are less risky than the equity, have been
affected as well. In mid-April, some analysts were expecting as
many as 1 in 3 CLOs to have to limit payouts to holders of their
riskiest securities.

Prices can end up dropping on securities in a deal where
payments have been cut off, because investors worry about the
quality of the loans backing the transaction, said Jason
Merrill, a CLO specialist at Penn Mutual Asset Management.
“It’s broadly considered a sign of deal distress,” Merrill
said.

While investors might expect high-yield securities to
suffer in a downturn, investment-grade instruments are supposed
to be less vulnerable. During the last financial crisis, CLO
bonds rated AA or AAA saw no defaults due to downgrades of the
underlying loans. The default rates for A and BBB rated notes
were infinitesimal, amounting to less than 0.01%, according to
the Structured Finance Association’s Callahan.

Bondholders could face curtailed payments as CLOs fail the
senior over-collateralization tests, which require the value of
the loans a CLO holds to exceed the value of the bonds it issued
by a sufficient amount. Failing that requirement results in
interest and principal payments getting deferred on the bonds
and cut off to equity. Those are instead diverted to pay down
the safest notes issued by the CLO.

CLOs issued by firms including Marathon, Pretium and
Jefferies Finance have failed these tests. If the portfolio
grows in value sufficiently over time relative to the
liabilities, the failure is “cured” and payments to investors
can resume. With the Jefferies transaction, it used cash built
up from loan repayments that couldn’t be used to buy new loans,
since the CLO’s reinvestment period had ended, to remedy the
deal’s breaches.

Representatives at Pretium, Marathon and Jefferies declined
to comment.

CLO portfolio managers can sometimes cure their shortfalls
through skillful trading, but loan downgrades have come so fast
that many managers were unable to shed poorly performing loans
quickly enough in recent weeks. Even more transactions are
failing less stringent tests of whether the deal has enough
collateral, known as interest-diversion tests.

“We are only at the beginning of the first inning of seeing
significant distress in the leveraged loan market,” said Michael
Barnes, executive chairman at Tiptree Inc., and founding partner
of Tricadia Holdings, an investment manager that also issued
CLOs. “It may severely impact equity, BBs and possibly BBBs with
capital losses in the coming years.”

The record surge in downgrades has pushed more CLOs to sell
loans they own: debt to companies rated CCC can usually only
account for about 7.5% of the holdings of a portfolio backing a
CLO under the terms of the securities.

With recent rating cuts, many portfolios saw these limits
exceeded. CLOs have to mark those excess loans at their market
trading price, which effectively lowers the value of the
collateral. That can spark more overcollateralization-test
breaches, potentially creating a downward spiral.

There will almost certainly be more CLOs selling loans,
depressing the value of their assets further. There’s little
sign that the businesses paralyzed by the pandemic can soon
return to normal levels of revenue generation that would improve
their financial standing. Moody’s Investors Service placed about
$22 billion of CLO securities -- which get rated separately from
their underlying loans -- on watch for a downgrade earlier this
month, citing the deterioration in corporate credit quality.
CLOs have these tests to protect the senior bondholders.

Market participants tout them as mechanisms that specifically
fortify CLOs against credit shocks, although whether they can
outlast a shock of this magnitude remains to be seen. Bank of
America said in a report earlier this month that failing
overcollateralization tests for investment-grade portions of
transactions likely hasn’t happened since the 2008 financial
crisis.

Here are some of the deals that have failed overcollateralization tests for investment-grade securities:

* The Pretium deal, called Crown Point CLO 6, was a reset of a
deal originally issued by NewMark Capital in 2014. Pretium
agreed to acquire two of NewMark Capital’s CLO assets in 2018.
The Marathon deal, CLO VI, was issued in 2014, and its re-
investment period, or the period during which the CLO manager

With the Covid-19 pandemic reducing global oil demand by devastating numbers, oil storages are filling quickly in the US, forcing producers to start shutting output in the country and creating a big tanker congestion on its coasts. A Rystad Energy analysis reveals that 28 tankers with Saudi oil, including 14 VLCCs and carrying a total of 43 million barrels, will arrive on the US Gulf and West coasts between 24 April and 24 May.

The Saudi fleet, with oil loaded at Ras Tanura, will join an existing congestion of 76 tankers that are currently waiting to unload in US ports. Most of these tankers are on the West Coast, where 34 tankers are waiting in line to offload about 25 million barrels of crude. In addition, about 31 tankers, carrying a similar load, are waiting for a slot to unload on the US Gulf Coast."

604,t3_garh7b,investing,FAANG stocks are holding up the market and they all missed on EPS so far,"The Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings. EDIT: NEVERMIND, AMAZON MISSED ON EPS TOO. Surprisingly Apple was the only beat but that's because their estimates were low.

Here's the thing... According to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter.

If we look at tech across the board, we have some winners like Microsoft and Zoom, but chip makers like AMD (which met EPS estimates but didn't beat) and Qualcom both delivered poor guidance for coming quarters. AMD has been rallying back to all time highs. Nvidia is also near all time highs. Yet, despite the relative strength in the tech sector, the current trend of earnings, economic forecasts and guidance (or lack thereof) strongly suggests that tech will take a huge hit in coming quarters.

Let's look at how concentrated the S&amp;P is in the very top stocks, all of which are tech... [https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg) This blows the dot com boom out of the water. Now consider how much of the S&amp;P the rest of the tech stocks account for.

All of this is to say, watch these tech stocks closely.  If they fall, the indexes will go with them. There is a high probability they will lead the next leg of the drop.

Also, here's my take on the long term value of these stocks. The US is moving closer and closer towards adopting basic income. Nothing is guaranteed, but if anything has made the case for increased automation and basic income, it's the current circumstance. Such a policy would likely necessitate a rise in corporate taxes or a VAT. That's a direct hit to  the earnings of notorious tax evaders like Amazon. In addition, basic income would give working class people more leverage in holding out for higher pay because they wouldn't be weighing job offers against total destitution. This too would detract heavily from future earnings.

After the 2000 crash, the Nasdaq didn't recover to the highs for 15 years. If you look at the S&amp;P chart I posted, two of the top five stocks in 2000 were Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft took 16 years to recover to its highs and Intel never fully recovered.

Therefor, I advise extreme caution in this environment. Do not be shamed out of taking profits near all time highs if that's what you personally feel comfortable with. I won't say it's wrong to hold if you're ready to accept the risk, however, just because these companies are good ""blue chips stocks"" that doesn't mean that they're low risk or no risk, regardless of your time horizon. That's just my two cents.

EDIT: It's funny that the tech stocks started to crash the day after I posted this. That was quick."

Does anyone here think that the speed with which the market has risen is irrational? Not that it matters, gains are gains.
But it's worrying that the values of some companies are back to where they were pre-corona, especially considering the huge influx of stimulus and the change to business environments.

I'm not here to debate where the market should go, rather whether or not this run is sustainable.

My thoughts: the market is currently driven by FOMO and unprecedented stimulus, with the exception that some companies should still be able to turn a profit i.e. tech.

On a couple of occasions i have seen equity being raised at a predetermined 'placement price', with this being said if i were to take up this offering and the market price had increased, is the spread between market and placement all profit?

ie. placement price = $1.0, market price at settlement = $1.50, therefore profit = $0.5 per share.

Am i missing something? is there a dilution aspect that needs to be incorporated. 

This also got me thinking, if this is possible is there a potential play in holding 1 share in each company in hopes of this scenario occurring repeatedly? I understand that current market situations are extraordinary and are key determinate of majority of these equity raises, however even in a 'normal' market i could see this as a play. I am also aware there is usually a price/volume ceiling associated with the number of shares available to purchase in the raise.

611,t3_gaoj6z,investing,MTCH set up for a short squeeze?,"With the advent of social distancing social media/web based services (food delivery, teleconferencing, exercise, education etc) engagement is surging (see recent FB, SNAP earnings reports). However, user base growth has been partially offset by decreased ad revenue.

Enter MTCH, 98% of revenue is attributable to direct sources, such as subscription fees, while ad revenue falls under indirect sources and comprises some portion of the remaining 2% (2019 AR). Current EPS estimates are around 9% lower than actual EPS Q4 '19 and have been downgraded multiple times in the last 90 days. Meanwhile short interest is extremely high (ranked #[2](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)) with a short float near [70%](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MTCH) and a time to cover of [18](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mtch/short-interest) days. 

The elephant in the room for this stock is the pending IAC separation and I do not pretend to understand how this event will impact the long-term outlook for MTCH. However, investors do not appear to have been spooked by a recently announced amendment to the IAC separation deal and it is hard to believe that this will weigh heavily on the interpretation of Q1 results. 

Despite dropping estimates I see no reason for an ad driven Q1 drop in MTCH revenue or EPS given the data now available from FB and SNAP; in fact declining competition for advertising may benefit the company as this is one of their larger expenses. If true this puts MTCH in position for a significant earnings beat. Short sellers are vulnerable to this EPS suprise and may find themselves in a squeeze; this may also be triggered if the stock continues to climb on positive market sentiment from other large corps' (AMZN) reports this week."

Opinion: **We should all come to the conclusion that Trump sees the stock market’s success as the true picture of our economy.** 

That being said, as far as I know the election isn’t until November (7 months from now). 

If the market tanked in a matter of weeks, why wouldn’t the FED be able to again just pick up all the pieces once more should it happen all over again. You can’t all be seriously thinking we’ll hit ATH in the next week or two and sustain that till November and beyond. 

Let’s be real, Trumps buddies got smacked, he gave them a helping hand and now they’re in a prime position to short the market and make their money all over again. Trump can be the hero once more. 

Yes the recovery won’t be V shaped, so it’ll be booming after a “healthy drop.” Every figure, every analyst, every projection is looking for some kind of pullback. 

Even bullish investors I follow are starting to get confused. Yes this isn’t 2008, but even back in January everyone and their mother was screaming that stocks were overvalued. 

Now with a global pandemic, unemployment at record highs, stimulus for everyone, GDP contraction at great depression levels, and we’re all of a sudden back?? It’s just not healthy, PERIOD. It’s not sustainable. Q2 numbers are expected to be shit. Everyone’s guidance is basically pulled. And look at the markets reaction last week when news broke out that Gileads drug could be a flop.. it spooked! 

Things are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That’s not to say we won’t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we’re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it’ll likely fall hard.. maybe it’ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash.

SPY and DIA 12% off all time highs. I used to think when this first started there would be a V shaped recovery and that the virus's impact on business will not be so bad, but I changed positions in early April when oil crashed and we saw that massive unemployment was coming as well as worsening data from the virus showing the worst case outcome. The unemployment figures will change consumer spending, many people are surviving on debt right now and that debt has to get payed off -  instead of buying new cars and going on vacation spending will be much more modest.

Yet the market shrugs it off. If everything is going up because of where earnings will be 2-3 years from now my questions are:

1. If there is this much confidecne in the future why not value companies at what they will earn 10-20-50 years from now? Why do stocks go down at all if ""future earnings will always be better""? Thats been the market behavior for the last decade.
2. Its hard enough to predict where earnings will be next quarter, why are we seeing trading based on where things are expected to be 2 years from now? How can anyone make any investment decisions with any accuracy, seems like there are a lot of assumptions taking place that are not following the fundamanetal data, or I am missing something.
3. Things are NOT CHEAP anymore, they were the last 2 weeks of March relative to the last few years. If people shrug off the bad news now, why didn't they back then when nothing is really different and we already saw that what happened in China has spread globally. Why are people buying Tesla now at 900 when it was 350 a month ago?
4. I thought at around SPY 250 we would turn around to test the lows again but its been straight up at a 45 degree angle. There is an arguement saying that the crash already happened and thats why everything is rebounding. Okay great, the bottom is in but the economy is different and worse than a lot of people expected. With oil remaining this low the shale economic boom we've enjoyed for the last 10 years is over and all of those companies can't turn a profit and will lay off a couple hundred thousand people at least. ""So what, stocks only go up"" doesn't seem like the responsible behavior.
5. Earnings right now are NOT GOOD, most have had a full Q1 and have barely had any time for the economic shutdown to affect them. Most are also giving no guidance saying they don't know how things will be. Stocks go up.
6. A headline declaring ""the economy is reopoening"" doesn't mean everyone will suddenly fill up movie theatres like before and start going on vacation. Many people living with elderly family will still be cautious through  the rest of the year if not indefinately until there is a vaccine  and hanging out at a bar while maintaining 6 feet of social distancing isn't going to be the same as before.

Do you think the market is overly optimistic on returning back to normal? If not, what are we missing and failing to understand? Why are we so close to all time highs? US markets exchange $168 billion a day. The fed adding $5 billion to that per day, mostly in treasuries, is a drop in the bucket no?

While answering analysts’ questions about liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic, Musk called shelter-in-place orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.”


Musk said he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at the company’s factory in Fremont, California, saying that possibility should be considered “a serious risk” given Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its Shanghai-based plant. Tesla had initially said the factory it would remain open despite shelter-in -lace orders until the county where it’s located said it could not be considered an essential business. Six counties, including Alameda, where Tesla’s factory is located, recently extended their shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. 

Musk had spoken out about government restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Twitter, but further expressed his opinion on Wednesday’s call while encouraging government officials to invest in infrastructure. He praised China for having “much better” infrastructure than the U.S.

“This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said.

“I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

At another point on the call, he said, “So the expansion of the shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country, excuse me. It’s outrage, it’s an outrage. It will cause loss, great, great harm, but not just to Tesla, but any company. And while people will weather the storm there are many small companies that will not,” he said.

He continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f--k?”

The Bay Area’s orders do not say that people cannot leave their house, but do restrict non-essential businesses from staying open and ban many other activities, such as large public gatherings.

Some states, including Michigan and Texas, have seen protests of stay at home orders as fears about economic deterioration grow. But public health officials have cautioned that reopening too quickly could result in cases of Covid-19 re-accelerating and developing new hot spots that could overwhelm health systems.

Interest rates likely to stay at 0% for months or even years

Feds buying junk bonds therefore few if any blue chip corporations will need to worry about liquidity

But I also have a lot of blue chip holdings. Many of them I bought around Mar 19th at the low of 2020s market. So I have companies up 40-60% . And some at (or close to) all time highs like Amazon,Tesla, Google, fb etc.

I have other companies In M1 I just use as sort of a savings account. I deposit every 2 weeks and am shooting for 50k in a couple years. I'm up 20% All time and some companies are up 60%

644,t3_gai39k,investing,The road to recovery for heavily indebted EU countries?,"What I rarely see discussed is the implications of very indebted EU countries like Italy and Spain on the rest of the EU, and what implications it could have for businesses in Europe. And I think it's a discussion worth having, since I can't seem to paint a picture that isn't horrific for the EU (and especially Southern Europe). As I have at most marginal knowledge in this field, please read the bullet points as my train of thought.

**Pre COVID-19 situation:**

* ECB interest rate at 0.0% interest since 2016
* ECB buying up debt ever since the Eurocrisis
* Debt to GDP ratio: France, Spain, Belgium nearing 100%; Italy 130%
* In the best of times, aforementioned countries could barely make a dent in paying back their debt
* Saving grace is that the yield is very low and even negative on short term bonds.
* Ageing population and high youth unemployment

**COVID-19 situation:**

* Spain, Italy, France most hit areas. As a result, they had to implement the most restrictive lockdowns seen in the West. Industry at standstill. GDP likely contracting \~8-10% or more on average for these countries.
* ECB buying up debt, securities and everything in between.
* Northern European countries very reluctant to implement low yield eurobonds, as this would increase interest on their respective outstanding debts and would be electoral suicide. Meanwhile southern European countries see anti EU sentiments lighting up again due to receiving a cold shower from their Northern counterparts.

**The future**

* Countries like Spain, Italy (and to a lesser extent), France would need to keep existing social safety nets buoyant while seeing massive increases in unemployment and business foreclosures.
* Stimulus money is needed to jumpstart the economy
* These countries will bury themselves into deeper debt levels.
* ECB has less room to manoeuvre than FED, and even less after QEing and keeping interest rates low for years.

I can only see 2 outcomes in this: 1) Some kind of EU reconciliation. Northern European countries will be forced to service South European debts for decades to come (Eurobonds or some other mechanism) at knifepoint (i.e. otherwise face imminent depression or EU collapse). This will increase the role of the EU and diminishing the power and role of individual member states for good. This will leave the Northern European countries weaker and more indebted 2) Spain and Italy will truly be stagnant for decades to come, making the future of the EU uncertain due to anti EU sentiment.

What am I missing? Am I too bearish on this? Would it be advisable to stay clear of most European stocks for now?"

(Bloomberg) -- Hudson’s Bay Co. missed April payments on
two commercial mortgage-backed securities that were part of $696 million in financing for Saks Fifth Avenue and other stores.
The securities, originated in 2015, were current until this
month when the company missed interest-only debt payments
totaling $3.2 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
and a person familiar with the matter.

HBC spokeswoman Nicole Schoenberg declined to comment.
The missed payments in the HBC debt portfolio were on
securities that financed 34 properties - 10 Saks and 24 Lord &amp;
Taylor stores. The Saks locations include Beverly Hills,
California, Atlanta, Chicago and Miami.

HBC operates retail stores, which have been hit hard by
social-distancing guidelines that have frozen much the economies
in the U.S. and Canada. Department stores were facing financial
challenges even before being forced to close, as shoppers
increasingly embraced the convenience of e-commerce. Now, those problems are getting worse.

Macy’s Inc., which has furloughed workers and shuttered
stores, is exploring a rescue financing deal to shore up its
liquidity. Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. missed payments on some
bonds this month, according to a letter from an investor. J.C.
Penney Co. also skipped an interest payment and huddled with
advisers, with bankruptcy among the options under discussion.
Almost 11% of retail CMBS loans were as much as 30 days
delinquent this month, up from 1.7% in March, according to an
April 23 report by the CRE Finance Council, a commercial real
estate trade group.

Toronto-based HBC, originally established as a fur trading
company in the 17th century, was taken private this year, after

What are you opinions in terms of how the real estate market will play out going forward? Predictions for end of 2020 and end of 2021?

My take on it is that slowing sales will result in more inventory building up overtime and eventually sellers will have to lower prices. Economic recovery in terms of job growth will be slow going into 2021.  A certain amount of distressed homeowners will not be able to recover quickly enough to hold on to their property which will result in short sales or foreclosures. Home prices start declining Q4 2020-Q2 2021. Price recovery after that."

The conclusions could be also interesting to anticipate how markets will react to further Remdesivir news. I tried to find some reliable numbers in respect to the dosage of Remdesivir and put these into context of a full-fledged drug production.

In one source i've found the following about the dosage of Remdesivir, but i'm not sure if this applies in absolute terms for Covid-19 treatments.

**Dosage**

The dosing [regimen](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5278) under study in the U.S. for RDV is as follows:

* An initial one-time dose of 200mg
* Followed by 100mg per day for 10 days

Remdesivir is administered intravenously by injection.

The drug is stored in small vials (a 20ml), which contain 100mg Remdesivir as lyophilized powder. Each vial with 100mg Remdesivir powder is reconstituted with 19 mL of sterile water for injection and diluted into intravenous infusion fluids prior to intravenous administration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calculating production volume and demand**

I recall reading that Remdesivir is more effective in early treatment, hence on a sidenote a widely spread testing regime seems to be crucial here.

Assuming Remdesivir would be administered to 80% of infected patients at least for 5 days (recent study indirectly suggested 5 day treatment may be sufficient) and 20% of patients for at least 10 days (due to age, complications, etc.), and assuming (for the sake of having a starting point) there is a million patients every 3 months... the following calculations would apply

800000 patients x (200mg + (5days x 100mg)) = 560.000.000mg

200000 patients x (200mg + (10days x 100mg) = 240.000.000mg

800.000.000mg / 100mg (one vial) = 8.000.000 vials

Considering shipment to 4000 hospitals worldwide (the US has about 6000 hospitals) for one month and equally distributed volumes of Remdesivir, about 650 vials would be available to each hospital for a month, which is sufficient to treat between 54 to 92 patients monthly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns on production**

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/03/26/problem-remdesivir-making-it-14665](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/03/26/problem-remdesivir-making-it-14665)

It appears that Remdesivir is quite difficult to produce, hence its high cost. More info in above article. The remdesivir sequence consists of five reactions, and the difficult part is to ensure a high enough yield in each of these reactions. The process seems to be labour and time intensive.

**questions**

How much time would it take to build up one or several lab production line(s) able to make 8million Remdesivir vials every quarter?

How many patients each quarter would one need to anticipate globally, when lockdowns are lifted?

Regardless of the details considering various models it appears to be a huge undertaking."

675,t3_gadhod,investing,$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19,"Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1. In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February.
2. On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.
3. Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).
4. $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.
5. Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US. EU is past the 6-8 week mark and there's yet to be a recovery.
6. According to OICA, plant closures could cost US auto makers at least 900k auto sales in 2020, and global light vehicle production may be down as much as 20%."

Gilead Announces Results From Phase 3 Trial of Investigational Antiviral Remdesivir in Patients With Severe COVID-19

April 29, 2020 at 8:35 AM EDT [**PDF Version**](http://investors.gilead.com/node/36871/pdf)

***-- Study Demonstrates Similar Efficacy with 5- and 10-Day Dosing Durations of Remdesivir --***

FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 29, 2020-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 \[95% CI 0.51 – 1.12\] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

“Unlike traditional drug development, we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving global pandemic. Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 and how to best utilize the drug,” said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences. “These study results complement data from the placebo-controlled study of remdesivir conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and help to determine the optimal duration of treatment with remdesivir. The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of a pandemic, to help hospitals and healthcare workers treat more patients in urgent need of care.”

Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not yet been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of COVID-19. This study sought to determine whether a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir would achieve similar efficacy results as the 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies of remdesivir. Secondary objectives included rates of adverse events and additional measures of clinical response in both treatment groups. Patients were required to have evidence of pneumonia and reduced oxygen levels that did not require mechanical ventilation at the time of study entry. Clinical improvement was defined as an improvement of two or more points from baseline on a predefined seven-point scale, ranging from hospital discharge to increasing levels of oxygen support to death. Patients achieved clinical recovery if they no longer required oxygen support and medical care or were discharged from the hospital.

In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.

Clinical outcomes varied by geography. Outside of Italy, the overall mortality rate at Day 14 was 7 percent (n=23/320) across both treatment groups, with 64 percent (n=205/320) of patients experiencing clinical improvement at Day 14 and 61 percent (n=196/320) of patients discharged from the hospital.

**Impact of Earlier Treatment**

In an exploratory analysis, patients in the study who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptom onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms. Pooling data across treatment arms, by Day 14, 62 percent of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49 percent of patients who were treated late.

“These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective.”

Remdesivir was generally well-tolerated in both the 5-day and 10-day treatment groups. The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients in either group were nausea (5-day: 10.0%, n=20/200 vs. 10-day: 8.6%, n=17/197) and acute respiratory failure (5-day: 6.0%, n=12/200 vs. 10-day: 10.7%, n= 21/197). Grade 3 or higher liver enzyme (ALT) elevations occurred in 7.3 percent (n=28/385) of patients, with 3.0 percent (n=12/397) of patients discontinuing remdesivir treatment due to elevated liver tests.

Key efficacy and safety results from the study are included in the table below.

**About the SIMPLE Trials**

Gilead initiated two randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir, the SIMPLE studies, in countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

The first SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. The initial phase of the study randomized 397 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir 200 mg on the first day, followed by remdesivir 100 mg each day until day 5 or 10, administered intravenously, in addition to standard of care. An expansion phase of the study was recently added and will enroll an additional 5,600 patients, including patients on mechanical ventilation. The study is being conducted at 180 trial sites around the world, including sites in the United States, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

A second SIMPLE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir administered intravenously in patients with moderate manifestations of COVID-19, compared with standard of care. The results from the first 600 patients of this study are expected at the end of May.

I'm now in a position where I'm generating a lot more income and looking to diversify outside of stocks. I've now set up small recurring deposits for Bitcoin and Etherum. I'm somewhat treating this like an investment in gold with a lot more speculation that it might increase and the deposits are small enough that it won't hurt if these go to zero.

My question is what is the outlook around crypto currencies. They still seem entirely speculative and hold no inherent value. However, with the current state of the world economy and all these banks printing money, you have to think we might be in for a drastic change in how we think about currency. Also... That money has to go somewhere. We're seeing stocks return back to normal even when no one is working. How long until the population starts parking that money in other assets like crypto?

687,t3_ga88k1,investing,Gold Mining companies vs. gold commodity pricing,"I've recently purchased shares in a gold mining company in order to get exposure to gold price increases. However, a friend informed me that investing in a mining company doesn't expose you to positive gold price changes more than simply investing in the commodity itself due to the fact that gold mines deal in future contracts, therefore his thinking is that today's price swings don't help the mines value because they are already locked in to sell their gold at a previous lower price. This sounds right, but also seems weird as I have personally witness gold mine stocks fluctuate along with gold price changes. In addition while reviewing a gold mine's financial statement it said outright that their revenue was effected by commodity prices.  Is this due to a misinformed public on how gold mines generate their revenue? or does my friend not have the full picture?

688,t3_ga85gd,investing,Discussion: Near Term Inflationary Pressures,"Last night I was thinking about how the world economy is re-opening, and that pretty much across the world, the economies will be re-opening in stages. It seems that everywhere the first stage will be to open at a limited capacity. Speaking with a few restaurateurs in the last few days, They are concerned that opening at 25%/50%/75% capacity will allow them to cover their fixed costs until we go back to normal. 

So that got me thinking, how can these folks stay over water over the next few months? Then it dawned on me: Raising prices of their products wouldn't seem that far fetched. Despite demand dropping considerably over the next few months, supply would also be low (There will be establishments never re-opening + limited capacity rules = low supply). 

I continued down this rabbit hole of thought, and realized that maybe, there are some inflationary pressures lingering, but I haven't seen much talk of them. Here's some inflationary actions that I identified:

1. The one above. Establishments raising prices to stay afloat. 

2. Direct stimulus from all governments, both in forms of free money (Expanded EI) and cheap lending. 

3. Gas being at a near all time low. 

4. [This one is more meta] - The enormous amounts of marketing both from governments and corporations towards the consumer. I have a feeling that there will be a never-before-seen push to spend once things are more clear. 

I am not particularly sold on the thesis above, but I am hoping it triggers discussion here. Is there an argument for higher than expected inflation in the short to mid term?"

The Journal quoted NBC Universal Chief Executive Officer Jeff Shell as saying he expects to release movies simultaneously in theaters and direct-to-home formats.

Universal Studios is owned by NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. AMC has 1,000 theaters across the globe.

“AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theaters simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies,” AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said in a letter addressed to Universal Studios Chairman Donna Langley.

With movie theaters worldwide shuttered since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, AMC said the action was effective from Tuesday and would apply as and when its theaters reopen."

So if the vaccine tanks, I'm not out anything that I put in, but I wouldn't make anything. If I sell all, I'll profit the same amount I put in (depending on the time I sell). Or leave it all in and see where it goes. 

I'm wanting to see how far this climbs. But my current job is 3 long hour shifts over nights every week. So for three days every week I miss a lot. I don't want to check one day and see where they doubled while I slept and when I'm off of work they tank 50% lol. But I also can't keep up on news and everything either so I can't really watch it much for what might be coming.

700,t3_ga29zs,investing,ETF portfolio for stable growth?,"First off let me say thank you for everyone in this sub(s), I’ve learned so much from it.

I'm planning on making a shift from purely stocks/options portfolio to 80/20 mix of ETFs and growth stocks.  Maybe like a second account altogether. I’m 31 so my thinking is mostly to buy/hold, not to actively trade. Here are my possible ETF selections.

1. VOO (instead of SPY because of expense ratio [https://stockanalysis.com/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/](https://stockanalysis.com/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/)). Or Just go in different direction with VUG ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/VUG-vs-VOO](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/VUG-vs-VOO))
2. VTI (Total market exposure comparison with VOO [https://stockanalysis.com/voo-vs-vti/](https://stockanalysis.com/voo-vs-vti/)). I’m in between VTI or just go in a different direction with Small cap like VB/VBK or SLYV
3. QQQ (Because of non tech companies, NASDAQ 100 and also its popularity)
4. VXUS (International market exposure). I also found VIGI I have to do some research which one's better
5. FTEC (Technology sector)-I thought this is better compared to XLK ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/XLK-vs-FTEC](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/XLK-vs-FTEC)). But I’m not sure if VGT is better ([https://www.askfinny.com/compare/FTEC-vs-VGT](https://www.askfinny.com/compare/FTEC-vs-VGT))
6. ICLN (Clean energy). TAN is another option but its focus is on Solar ([https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34976n/buying\_tan\_and\_icln/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34976n/buying_tan_and_icln/))
7. XLE (Energy sector). I know this is in downtrend so this won’t be a long term hold like the others.
8. JETS (Airlines)
9. VNQ (REITs) I haven't done any research on this one though ([https://www.thebalance.com/best-reit-etfs-4174043](https://www.thebalance.com/best-reit-etfs-4174043))

There are so many other categories like emerging markets(VWO,EEM etc., developed markets(EFA,VEA etc.), sector wise like XLF(finance) and specialized ones like GLD (Gold),BND (Bond market) and so many categories ( and sub categories through a bunch of providers. What I haven't nailed down is what percentages is like a safe bet and of course for DCA'ing going forward.

There are couple sectors I think are good but not sure if I'd want them on my long term portfolio: Defense (ITA), manufacturing (FIDU for example). Want to hear your opinions on these. I guess we can replace REITs with either one of these if the returns/growth is good.

I have no idea how 3X leveraged ETFs/indexes like SOXL, SQQQ etc. work. But I want to see what do you think of having a balance ETF to these (like VIIX for example) in case of market downs. Is SQQQ a good one to hang on to or no?

What I'm planning to do is to have about 6-8 of these ETFs and maybe 3-4 blue-chip stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN etc. What I'm conflicted is this seems redundant as these 4 stocks usually makeup couple (or more) of the above mentioned ETFs. I'm hoping for some suggestions here.

I think it's hard to keep track of stocks if you own too many. I mean there's so many debates on how many is too many. I want to see what you guys think.

Thanks in advance for reading and for any responses.

There are plenty of posts here that discuss whether individual stock picking can beat the market or not  - this is not one of them.

I'm mainly looking for legit services that don't spam you with upselling their services (think MF) that could help along the way in screening and researching stocks.

One that I'd be particularly interested in is '**New Constructs**', which is a mix of human and AI robo advisor service created by MIT and HBS professors and researchers. Their proposition is to be ""the only Investment Research provider with a U.S. Patent for a system and method to reverse accounting distortion and analyze financial information to automatically determine the true profitability of a company, making us one of the top investment research firms in the nation."" Their research gets featured regularly in finance news across the board including Barrons, Reuters, Forbes, NYT, cnbc, etc. Their two premium services are priced at $50 and $100 per month.

Has anyone heard of them and have any experience? Open to other recommendations, too.

Cash balance as of April 24th was $35B. Revenue also dropped by 15% YoY and wholesale sales by by 21%.

ER Available on Ford's IR site here: https://shareholder.ford.com/investors/overview/default.aspx

Not a ton to say here, it was a pretty ugly quarter without the shutdown really kicking into high gear, the oil crash or unemployment spiking. Ford is also projecting a loss of &gt;$5B in full year earnings and capital spending around $6.5B for the year. On the plus side they did raise a good amount of cash, albeit on much worse terms than their last comparable bond offering several years ago. Losing their IG rating hurt and the automotive segment wasn't exactly going into this recession on the best footing either.

On the credit side they've also done some lease and payment deferrals already with around 10% of contracts being extended according to their slide deck. They added a loss provision for $554M as well which was a big hit to earnings on the credit side. The credit segment is going to be one of the big things to keep on eye on going forward."

726,t3_g9u1li,investing,A preliminary hypothesis regarding inflation and the pandemic....,"I am beginning to think that the current Covid-19 business environment could lead to inflation in several areas and wanted to see if this hypothesis holds water. 

One of the factors that can lead to price increases is a decrease in supply. We are all seeing this in grocery stores for staples like flour, sugar, toilet paper, etc... You might argue that this is merely a short term phenomenon and once people stop hoarding, supplies will be back to normal. However I don't think this applies to everything. I am reading supply chain disruption stories about huge businesses like Tyson Foods, Nestle, etc... Those issues don't appear to have a short term remedy. 

I am also hearing stories about states starting to re-open with requirements that certain businesses only allow something like 25 percent of their establishment to be available for customers. If you can only seat 25% of your restaurant or theater or airplane, and millions of people are clamoring for a night out/vacation, why not charge 4x the price to make up for lost volume? 

So, if the supply of goods and services is decreasing, and the money supply is increasing (stimulus, Federal Reserve balance sheet expected to surpass **$10 Trillion**, etc....) could this virus be the catalyst that unleashes a massive spike in prices/inflation?"

A real life example of this is found in Warren Buffet's 10 year bet against the hedge funds, where a simple S&amp;P500 index fund beat out funds actively managed by professionals. 

Knowing this, what is your justification for buying individual stocks? I also find myself thinking I can beat out the overall market, and more than half of my investments are in individual companies. Sometimes I find myself wondering if I'm overestimating my analytical skills/ thoughts about a company's future, and if I should just stick to the age old DCA index fund advice. 

I want to start a discussion about why you personally feel (or don't feel) like you can beat the S&amp;P500. My reasoning for thinking I can beat it in the current economy is that I think a large majority of the S&amp;P500 is going to either do very poorly in the near future (1-3 years) or go out of business all together. Therefore I've been picking stocks that I think should do well given the new circumstances."
735,t3_g9qibl,investing,PE investor perch: Help me make sense of the s-storm we're seeing in real-time,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

Here are my two-cents as a middle-market private equity investor; it's an interesting perch to watch things unfolding real-time... and which frankly makes me wonder WTH is going on in the public markets. I'm not going to edit this for typos.

**Earnings:** Our investments are relatively resilient (think trains, pharmacies, food supply chain stuff). But our earnings are getting absolutely smoked; I'm talking (20%) to (30%) territory. Our Q1 valuations won't really reflect this as March will have some China noise and 2 weeks of lockdown (the majority of American businesses will feel this on the margin), but Q2 and Q3 will be a mess... for us, we mark-to-market and carry on; but the hit on earnings poses a big covenant and liquidity issue.

In the public sphere, mark-to-market *is* the market. I can only interpret the market as saying your NTM earnings, however risky and unknown (this is without precedent, after all), are irrelevant because the long-term story holds water. Since when did the public markets move from being so short-term and hung up on quarterly earnings to so long-term? I'm lost.

**Refi wall**: Private companies went into Covid-19 with historically levered balance sheets. Granted, a lot of issuances were cov light at higher leverage levels, some are HY and are trading like shit, but even the best private loan terms have fixed charge covenants which will bite borrowers in the ass. There's about $1.5tn of corporate loans maturing over the next 12 months (what we call a refi wall). When that wall hits, companies will be refinancing off of significantly lower earnings (best case) or will be trying to find debt in a market that's seized (which is what we saw in 2009).

Imagine you earned $100mm of EBITDA and you were 4x levered heading into Covid. Now it's time to refinance, and your EBITDA is $75mm; you'd be looking to fill a 5x of hole on your balance sheet, and no one is lending at those levels any time soon. Sure, some businesses won't be down (25%), but a lot of industrial, old-world, cyclical businesses will be - and then some.

If you're a PE-backed company, you call in your best lending relationships and add some equity to fill the hole (or you say F it). If you're a SMB, I have to imagine you just throw in the towel. What other option do you have?

Government stimulus has been a huge boost on this front, but marginal credit heading into Covid-19 will be unfinanceable and businesses will go under en masse, whether it's a liquidity crunch today or an inability to refi tomorrow.

**Farm crisis**: I don't know why it doesn't get more media attention, but there's a storm brewing in the food supply chain. Granted, these points are hearsay, but we have it on pretty good authority that commercial farms will soon be forced to euthanize entire herds of livestock and poultry. The reality is that cows, chickens, and pigs get too old and too fat quickly, and when processors are shut down, there isn't a lot of time to spare. That's the protein story.

Produce could also face issues. Again, hearsay, but we've heard that some crops aren't going in during prime planting season. You might already be seeing the food supply chain - particularly truck - screwing things up (noticed any fresh produce missing from the menu of your grocery store or current take-out spot?), but if there's a fundamental supply issue it would spell serious trouble. You thought fighting over the last roll of toilet paper was bad?

I would love to be fact-checked on this front. Again, it's coming from sources in the thick of things, but it's quite ominous when food security in North America is a topic of discussion.

**O&amp;G**: The fracking boom has been a massive driver of employment over the last decade or so. As wells shut off, people will be sent home. I don't think I need to go into this more, but too much or too little oil are both huge issues for America.

**Credit cards &amp; other consumer debt**: This one has been getting a bit more traction as the value investor blogs have been all over it. Let's say we are back to normal in a few weeks or months time. And people are now able to go out and start spending again. Notwithstanding the fact that unemployment is insane (26mm?!) and it will take time for those people to re-enter the workforce, there will be a mountain of backdated credit card, mortgage, car, rent, and other loan payments they'll need to service before they buy that BBQ, renovate their house, or take a trip.

What card do you guys think the government has up its sleeve to gloss over that? I'm a family of four and I don't want the banks to foreclose on my house (obviously) or my car (to get to work); do we honestly think there's much left over after all that debt service? Maybe mass consumer loan forgiveness or refinancing (i.e., tack missed payments onto the end of the loan). I just haven't seen it.

Someone tell me everything above is wrong and I'm just seeing problems where solutions are in the works. I just can't make sense of everything I'm seeing - earnings getting smashed, lenders getting picky, fundamental supply and demand issues - next to a market that's modestly down (relatively) from record-highs. Am I missing something?"

They take they comapre younger working adults to middle age (age 40-65) working adults to try to predict the stock market. The basic theory is that younger adults(age 20-39) are likely to take out debt and be broke from having kids vs middle age whom would be investing and building their retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i was interested in a different ratio: the **retired population vs the working population**, defined as:

\-working population age 19-64

\-retired popuation 65+

My general thesis is that the working population serves as buyers into the stock market and the retired population serves as eventually sellers in the stock market. And yes, im aware many retiress stay invested, but they stop adding to their accounts and begin to make withdrawals overall. **I'll post the data in the comment section** to make this post easier to read.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1950 the ratio is about 10x, meaning there are 10 working class buying stocks for every 1 retiree withdrawaling from stocks. Today that ratio has steadily decreased and to about  6x and will be  3.5x by the time many of you retire.

Food for thought: how many new buyers does it take to replace one seller? Adjusted for inflation, the dow jones has made 1,000% gains since the 1950s, so does it take 10x new buyers to displace a seller with 1,000% return? luckily they are not cashing out 100% and only take out what they need to spend each month. So we stay afloat with only 6x new buyers for every 1 retired seller."

743,t3_g9k5mr,investing,Q2 Tanker earnings estimates.,"I posted in WSB, but the DD is more in the style of r/investing. Estimates used actual fleet composition of each company, using spot rates of each vessel class starting from beginning of Q2. 


For you all that think it’s too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.

EURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20

TNK 7.50eps -25

TNP 2.00 -4 (that’s 50%)

NAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows

DHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)

FRO 2.50- stock 10.50

And half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.

The product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn’t all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days. 

Lastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date.  If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2. 

To show you how out of date the projections are, EURN has a q2 projection of 1.20.... they earned that in April."

IFR: Infection Fatality Rate - percent of those who get the coronavirus die


If your investment is impacted at all by the rona, I recommend reading through /r/covid19 for science based articles and see through the fear mongering most of the news is promoting.


Despite making up 11% of cases (despite being a population much more heavily tested) - [the nursing home population makes up more than 50% of covid deaths in 6 states and is exceptionally higher than average](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-reporting-of-cases-and-deaths-due-to-covid-19-in-long-term-care-facilities/?utm_campaign=KFF-2020-Medicaid&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_g3x0lLoESTRe6UgazNM0z81iW3Vn2rGNK1CDP4D4ifzyzh3tuGLqWllBYM2IqaJi_T63Qg3862U-XrCj9e_td7vKMEg&amp;_hsmi=2)


Now the IFR predictions have dropped over time, starting from 4% to [now, from extrapolating based on the NY Antibody testing, even around 0.5%](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-statewide-antibody-testing-survey-will)


So we have a 0.5% IFR INCLUDING the nursing home population, which as I said before, is only 11% of cases, but account for a LARGE AMOUNT of deaths (in some states 50%)...


So for the average Joe the IFR is much lower, even (dare I say) approaching flu levels (or less). 


With such a large part of the workforce not at serious risk of death, I predict states and countries will successfully reopen while practicing EXTREME CAUTION with at risk residents. It simply does not make sense to have a majority of the country indoors when you can isolate the at risk pretty easily. 


When this information becomes more clear in May, I expect consumers to get less fearful and businesses start going again. And if you are scared about consumer habits, just look at the beaches that reopened, people are itching to get out. You can also look at travel/outdoors subreddits, people want to start doing things again.


So I think travel stocks will bounce back and many are severely undervalued. I started buying Carnival Cruise today, [small cruise ports are reopening in less than a week](https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/joint-survey-shows-status-northern-european-cruise-ports) and if they have success then there is no reason why cruises won't be sailing come July."

I used to buy these two ETFs all throughout 2010-2018.  I also owned stocks and I never held these two ETFs for too long because lots of older people with more financial industry experience than me said it wouldn't work.

Now it's 2020 and I've gotta ask... If we look at a portfolio of TMF/TQQQ bought 50/50 on January 1st is up 28%.

That is better than any stock index.

If we do a back test for multiple years I get higher Sharpe ratios, higher CAGR, the best year performance is significantly more exaggerated than the worst year performance, etc.

You are forced to buy low and sell high... And it's clearly beating the SPY.

If anything it might make sense to add a small position in an actual treasury fund like TLT or IEF to offset some of the leverage... But the back testing says something else.

I used portfolio visualizer and SPY as my benchmark.

Anyone have any legitimate reasons why this is not a good idea?

Edit:

I've added some data.  We are starting in 2010 with $10000 invested equally into TQQQ and TMF.  Then $1000 is added quarterly.  Portfolio is rebalanced quarterly as well.

SPY:
final balance $84,114
CAGR 25.89%
best year 32%
worst year -19%
Sharpe .79

50/50 TMF/TQQQ:
final balance $386,000
CAGR 48.46%
best year 86.59%
worst year -7.36%
Sharpe 1.41


TLDR

considering how the fed has been acting, the precedent is bailouts and socialization of losses.  What real world scenario am I missing where TMF/TQQQ does not continue to outperform a more traditional stock/bond portfolio?

Considering the portfolio is up 28% YTD can we assume it has been debunked that leveraged ETFs can't be held long term.

748,t3_g9g9l3,investing,Negative effective bond yields - What does this mean?,"I know there has been speculation as to if the US treasury yields will go negative, but there is something I've been contemplating: the effective yield of them already has \*been\* negative for some time. The fed's stated policy goal is an inflation rate of 2%; it usually hits between 1%-1.5%. There were many times even in the last decade where the 10 year T-bond yield was below the stated inflation goal rate, and now it's around 0.6%, implying a return of -1.4%.

What I am wondering is, why are people investing in these securities which are going to lose money after inflation happens? Is it simply because of an oversupply of dollars? Or is it an undersupply problem? If the demand for these bills are in high demand, ie US dollars are in short supply, and the yield falls below the inflation rate, then that is effectively pulling dollars out of the system, no? Less dollars in the system means the yields will fall lower, and inflation will pull even more out.

In the last recession in 2008, inflation hit around 5.5%, with the 10 year bond yield sitting around 3.5%. If inflation hits between 5%-6% again, the spread between that and the yield is going to be much larger.

Does this mean that we shouldn't expect inflation as high as 5-6% this time around? Or does it mean that the markets are so volatile right now that traders would rather take a 5% loss on their investment than be exposed to the stock market?"

758,t3_g9bz9f,investing,Back to Basics: Real Estate Investing,"Hi All,

First of all, I’m a data scientist by profession but a history major by training. So I’ve tried to cite all relevant data points with a (&lt;source&gt;) tag. This allows us to separate debating the data vs. the analysis. I’m also a complete newbie to real estate investing. One of the main goals in fact of this post is to organize my thoughts so far and solicit feedback from more knowledgable individuals. 


As part of a balanced portfolio, I've invested passively in real estate for several years (both public REITs and a small amount in a private platform). As my assets have grown and I'm entering the age to buy a primary residence, I've been trying to educate myself on the housing real estate market. After all, even if you don't own any investment properties the purchase of a home is the largest single financial transaction you'll likely ever make. In fact, if you look at the chart linked below (1, see Sources below) you'll see housing is the single largest asset for households with net worth below 1 million dollars, i.e. ~90% of Americans (2). In fact, even in 2010 (in the midst of the Great Financial Crisis): ""The primary residence represented 62% of the median homeowner’s total assets and 42% of the median home owner’s wealth"" (3).  In fact, reading the Economist recently (obviously in my slippers) I was surprised to discover housing is the world's largest asset class. This HSBC report (avoiding the Economist paywall) cites housing as a $226 trillion (!) asset class at the end of 2016 (4) out of a total net worth in 2018 of ~$360 trillion according to Credit Suisse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even with my casual research, it's clear that real estate is divided into multiple segments including residential, commercial, industrial, farm land, etc. Even the subsector of residential is divided into single family, multi-family, commercial, mobile homes, etc. These segments are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. So far I’ve limited my research to the US residential sector: single family homes, multifamily, and small commercial apartment buildings. Therefore moving forward when I say real estate I will limit the scope to the above US residential housing market, i.e. acquiring individual or personal portfolio of US housing properties. 

&amp;nbsp;



More formally, the purpose of my analysis below is: 

* Understand my options as it pertains to real estate. E.g. is it better to consider “house hacking”, i.e. buying a primary residence and several investment units as part of a duplex, triplex, etc. 
* Avoid making obvious mistakes in the purchase of my primary home

* To summarize what I’ve learned and start to develop opinion about real estate investing more broadly as a complement to public equities investing

* Broaden my knowledge professionally (my clients include large real estate companies) 

* Learn from the community! 

Note: I considered posting this in /r/realestateinvesting, but ultimately my goal is to evaluate real estate vs. other asset classes. Obviously some people will simply prefer real estate for a variety of reasons, but personally my goal is to achieve the greatest return for the least risk and work. I should stress that I love my career (data scientist) and have no intention of quitting, so the last point is particularly important. 

&amp;nbsp;


**Analysis**

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that immediately strikes me as an investor accustomed to public securities, e.g. bonds / stocks, is how odd the real estate market (in particular housing) is in comparison. Having a margin account from a broker, i.e. getting leverage, is often a difficult process reserved for “advanced” investors. In residential real estate, it’s considered “conservative” for an individual to have leverage of 4-5 to 1 (FHA loans, for example, only require 3.5% down in some cases!) . What’s even crazier is that the loan is often issued at only 2-4% over the 10 year US treasury rate.  For example today, April 26th, the 10 year treasure is 0.606% while NerdWallet has a rate of 3.3% for a prime credit score, single family home, primary residence 30 year loan. 



&amp;nbsp;


Perhaps because real estate is the only avenue available for newer investors to take on large amounts leverage immediately, I've seen extreme and, in my opinion, irrational positions on the subject. Even a cursory glance at BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. uncovers multiple posts along the lines of either  ""real estate investing is the best investment ever!"" vs. ""the real estate market is a massive bubble and will crash soon"". I've summarized a few of the common tropes I've seen below with my analysis.


&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a huge bubble, and is going to collapse any day!

As noted above, real estate / housing has numerous segments that are further divided across geographies with wildly different tax, capital, and regulatory regimes. Saying that ""real estate"" will crash is like saying the “food industry” will crash. What segment and where? US soybean growers? Fast Food? Argentinian ranchers?  McDonalds in particular? 

Limiting our discussion to US housing: the Case-Shiller national price index (7) shows that home prices dropped ~27% from peak to trough in the Great Financial Crisis over a period of  almost 6 years (Mid 2006 to early 2012). The reason this was such a catastrophic event is that housing had never decreased nationally in a significant way before in the modern era (see Case Schiller home price index). Of course, it’s worth noting that housing had rarely increased rapidly against inflation before. 

Let’s assume we had an equivalent event occur. The Jan 2020 index was at 212, so home prices would decrease by 27% to ~155 (mid 2008 levels). Crucially though, this price drop would be expected to play out for years! During that time vested interests (more on that later) would lobby governments extensively for support, foreign and US investors could form funds to take advantage of the situation, etc. As a reference point there is ~$1.5 trillion available in US private equity funds alone as of January 2020. 

However, it is worth pointing out that this is at the national level. Local real estate markets, particularly those dependent on select industries or foreign investors, could easily see more dramatic price movements. The US census has a really cool chart (22) that shows the inflation adjusted (as of year 2000) median home values every decade by state from 1940 to 2000. We see that Minnesota home values actually dropped from $105,000 in 1980 to $94,500 in 1990, a fall of more than 10%. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Everyone needs a place to live, therefore housing can never go down

Everyone needs a place to eat, but restaurants and grocery stores are famously low margin businesses (5). Farms supply an even more basic need, but many go bankrupt (6). The question isn’t whether housing will go down or not, but whether it will return an attractive rate of return compared to alternative investments. 

It’s also worth pointing out that for most “retail” US housing real estate investors, they are investing in a narrow geographic area. Migration and births/ deaths can play a huge role in the need for housing in a given area. Case in point, NYC may have actually begun losing population to migration in 2017 / 2018 (23). Even more interesting, NYC has experienced a substantial loss due to domestic migration which is almost balanced by foreign immigration / new births (24). If foreign immigration decreases in the post-COVID we would expect NYC’s population to decline more rapidly given current trends. 

It is entirely possible for national housing prices to modestly increase while expensive coastal markets decline significantly, for example. 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; It's supply and demand. There's a nationwide housing shortage so prices can only go up! 

This one has some factual basis. Freddie Mac put out a study in Feb 2020 (18) which indicated that there is a shortage of housing units between 2.5 - 3.3 million units. Some interesting notes about this study is that they consider the “missing” household formation and extrapolate interstate migration trends. As noted below, the US builds ~1.3 million housing units a year, so this reflects ~2 years of housing construction. It’s also worth noting the geographic variation, with “high growth” states like Massachusetts, California, Colorado, etc. seeing ~5% housing deficits vs. states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc. seeing housing surpluses of ~2-4%. 

However, a Zillow analysis on our aging population (11) points to a slightly different conclusion. Based on their analysis, an additional ~190,000 home will be released by seniors between 2017-2027 compared to 2007-2017. That number increases by another 250,000 homes annually between 2027-2037. Combined, this is about ~50% of the average annual homes constructed in the US between 2000-2009 at ~900,000. 

Given these slightly conflicting reports, let’s get back to basics. First, let's separate housing into single family homes, multi-family units, and large apartment buildings. Single family homes, particularly near dense and economically vibrant metros, are far more supply constrained. In contrast, multi family units / apartment towers are, barring regulatory issues (see California), less constrained by available land. See Hudson Yards in NYC, the Seaport area in Boston, the Wharf in DC, etc. It's worth noting that due to costs / market demand most of these developments cater to the entry level luxury category and above, but they are new supply. 

I actually wound up looking at US Census projections to get a sense of the long term outlook. By 2030 the Census estimates the population will grow from 334.5 million to 359.4, for a total increase of 24.9 million or an annual increase of 2.49 million (8). In 2019 the Census estimated 888,000 private single family units and 403,000 units in buildings w/ 2+ units were constructed for a grand total of 1,291,000 units (9). The average number of people per US household is 2.52 (10). Some simple math suggests that if we assume each new single family home contains the average number of Americans and each apartment conservatively contains only a single person we get 888,000 * 2.52 + 403,000 = ~2.64 million. 


Now, talking about averages in a national real estate market reminds me of a joke about Mars: on average it's a balmy 72 degrees. But the point still stands that at a high level, theoretical sense there is sufficient  ""housing"" for the US population. The question, as always, is at what price and location? 



&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Real estate is a safer investment than the stock market!

This one honestly irritates me. While there are many advantages to real estate I can see, safety is not one of them. It is a highly leveraged, illiquid, extremely concentrated asset when bought individually (i.e not in a REIT). Let’s use an example here. Is there a financial advisoy in the world who would recommend you put your entire investment portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway? Of course not, diversification is the bedrock of modern personal finance. And yet Berkshire Hathaway is an extremely diversified asset manager with well run and capitalized companies ranging from Geico to Berkshire Homes to Berkshire Energy. Oh, and it also has $130 billion (with a B) in cash equivalents. 

I honestly think this impression stems from 3 factors: 

* Almost all asset prices have gone up (barring a few 1-2 month downturns) for 10+ years. There was also a shortage of skilled labor, capital, etc. that dramatically reduced the new supply of housing
* Survivorship bias. The people who fail in real estate tend to limp away quietly. The ones who survive and succeed tout their success loudly. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; You won’t build your wealth in the stock market

One common theme I’m already noticing listening to podcasts, reading blogs, etc. is that many people started investing in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis (2009 - 2011). And, in retrospect, it was clearly a great time to buy property! But it was also a great time it turns out to buy almost every investment. 

I plugged in the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 from December 2009 to December 2019 with dividends reinvested (and ignoring the 15-20% long term tax on dividends) (12). It was 13.3%. If you managed to buy at the market bottom of Feb 2009 it was 15.8%! 

The long term annual average of the S&amp;P 500 from 1926 - 2018 is ~10-11% (with dividends reinvested). (13). The S&amp;P has never lost money in a 30 year period with dividends reinvested, see the fantastic book Stocks for the Long Run (14). In fact, if you’re investing before 30 the worst 35 year period (i.e. when you would turn 65) is 6.1% (15). 

Housing, in general, has tracked at or slightly above inflation ( 16). Even a click bait CNBC article (17) about “skyrocketing” home prices states that homes are rising 2x as fast as inflation (i.e. ~4%). If you look at the CNBC chart for inflation adjusted prices, you’ll see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3% from 1940 to 2000. Let’s do this same exercise again with the Average Sales Price of Homes from Fred (i.e. Fed economic data) (18). In Q1 1963 the average sales price of a house was $19,300. In Q4 2019 it was $382,300. That is a CAGR of ~5.38% over ~57 years. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that while real estate does have some tax advantages, there are also property taxes, maintenance, etc. 

But it’s harder than that. Because real estate is an illiquid asset. In general, illiquid assets require higher returns than 
the equivalent liquid asset because of the inconvenience / risk of not having the ability to transact frequently. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Case study of real estate purchase:**

I’d like to focus the rest of my analysis on an area that many members of BiggerPockets, /r/realestateinvesting, etc. seem to gloss over: credit. I was surprised to see that for first time home buyers, 72% made a down payment of 6% or less according in Dec 2018 according to (27). This would imply prices only have to decrease 6% to put these new homebuyers underwater, i.e. owe more after a sale than their mortgage. But  this fails to take into account costs associated with buying a property, which are substantial at 2-5% for closing according to Zillow (28). Costs for selling a property are even more substantial, ranging from 8-10% according to Zillow (29). This means that sellers only putting down 6% could be underwater (in the sense that they couldn’t sell without providing cash during the sale) with even modest price decreases when taking into account these transactional costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


Obviously there are ways to reduce these costs, so let’s walk through a hypothetical example of the median valued home of ~$200,000. 

&amp;nbsp;


A young, first time home-buyer puts down 10%, or $20k, and takes out a mortgage for $180,000. They also pay (optimistically) closing costs of 2% for $4000. Luckily, they bought in a hot housing market and prices increased 5% (real) over the next 5 years. Their house is now worth ~$255,000. They sell their house and again, optimistically, closing costs are only 4%. This means they pay $10,200. Consequently, after netting out costs we calculate naively that they would make $255k - $10k - $4k - $200k (original purchase price of home) = $41k. Given they only invested $20k of their own money, this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~15.4%, which is handily above the S&amp;P 500’s average. This is the naive calculation I first made, but as we’ll see it is deeply flawed. First, let’s look at costs. 


&amp;nbsp;


WalletHub has a really nice chart that shows (conveniently) property taxes on a $205,000 home across all 50 states (30). The average American household spends $2375 on property taxes, so let’s assume a little less and go for $1500. So 5 years x $1500 = $7500. 


&amp;nbsp;


For home maintenance, the consensus seems to be ~1% annually for home maintenance with wide variation. We’ll assume that’s $2000 off the base price, so $2000 * 5 = $10,000.  (31).


&amp;nbsp;


For homeowner’s insurance, Bankrate (32) provides a nice graph that shows the average annual cost for a $300,000 dwelling across all states and then a separate chart for costs based on dwelling coverage. For a $200,000 dwelling coverage we have a figure of $1806 per year, so over 5 years we have $1800 * 5 = $9000. 


&amp;nbsp;


Finally we need to calculate the interest on the debt. One thing that I didn’t realize until I looked at an amortization table how front-loaded the interest payments are. Case in point, I plugged in the $180,000 loan into the amortization calculator (34) using a 3.5% interest rate and saw that we pay on average ~$6000 each year in interest vs. only ~$3800 to principal. 


&amp;nbsp;


**So lets’s run the new numbers.**

You sell your home still for $255,000. After 5 years, your mortgage is now ~$160000 (i.e. you paid off 20,000 over 5 years, or ~$4k per year). So after the sale  you are left with ~$95,000. The buying and selling costs remain the same as before, so we subtract the $14k for $81,000. We also then subtract $7500 (property taxes), $10,000 (home maintenance), $9000 (homeowners insurance)  which gives us $54,500.


&amp;nbsp;


We paid ~$9,700 each year in mortgage interest + principle (~6000 interest and $3700 principal). So  5 * 9700 = $48,500.

&amp;nbsp;



So, net of everything we get $255,000 - $160,000 (remaining mortgage) - $48,500 (mortgage payments over 5 years) - $14k (buying / selling costs) - $7500 (property taxes) - $10,000 (home maintenance) - $9000 (home insurance) =  $6000. And we put down $20,000 as a downpayment, for a net compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of negative $21.4%. 


&amp;nbsp;

That is truly an astounding result. We had 10x leverage on an asset that went up 5% each year for 5 years and we somehow lost money on our “investment” of a down payment? Keep in mind we also used fairly optimistic numbers (particularly home price appreciation) and didn’t factor in PMI, etc. On the flip side, this home provided shelter, i.e. you didn’t pay rent. That’s a massive “avoided” cost and I don’t mean to minimize it. But the point here is that many homebuyers I’ve spoken to fail to account for the substantial costs of home ownership and expect their primary resident to generate a substantial return. 


&amp;nbsp;


Now, of course, for real estate investing you would likely either a) hold the property for less time and attempt to flip it via forced appreciation or b) have tenants in the property. Let’s focus on b) because frankly that’s more of my interest. From what little research I’ve done flipping houses requires much more  time that’s incompatible with my day job. 


&amp;nbsp;


I went ahead and used the rental price calculator I found online at (36) to calculate the return. I used a rent of $1300 monthly, a bit lower than the average national rent of $1476 (35) because our home price was also lower than the national average. I assumed a low vacancy rate of 5%, and no other expenses beyond the ones cited above (i.e. I didn’t assume property management, higher loan interest rate, higher property taxes). 


&amp;nbsp;


The calculator spit back a 5 year internal rate of return (a metric in this case useful  to compare against the securities markets)  of 27.79% return, i.e. a profit of $63k on an initial investment of $20k. The IRR as I understand it captures the time value of money, basically accounting for when you made various returns (37). E.g if an investment over 30 years pays nothing then gives you a lump sum payment at the end that’s very different than if it pays 1/30th of that lump sum every year. It’s useful in this case for comparing against the stock market because the IRR takes all future cash flows  back to a net present value of 0, i.e. as if we invested all the money immediately. 


&amp;nbsp;


**&amp;Now let’s do some scenario modeling (originally we had 10% down, 3.5% interest rate for an IRR of ~28%):**
 
* Let’s assume we have to put down 20%:  now we have a 19% IRR
* 20% down payment and a 5.5% (instead of 3.5%) interest rate: 14.7% IRR
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year instead of 5% with 10% down payment: 20%
* Home price appreciation of only 3% per year with 20% down payment: 12.65%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 10% down payment: 4.26%
* Home price appreciation of 0% per year with 20% down payment: -1.28%

This scenario for me demonstrated a number of interesting properties. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Owning a home for even a moderate amount of time (~5 years) will likely not build substantial wealth unless there is truly massive home appreciation. The transactional costs are too high, the ongoing costs are substantial, etc. And of course I’ve neglected to include all the remodeling, furniture, etc. that every home owner I’ve met has spent money on 
* With regards to real estate investing, home price appreciation covers up a magnitude of sins, particularly if coupled with a low cost of debt. Changing nothing but the home price appreciation changes the investment from incredible (28% IRR) to about 1/2 the expected return of the S&amp;P 500 (4.26%)
* Real estate, whether investing or owning a primary residence, has limited to negative cash flow initially. The loan is amortized so that all early payments go to interest, maintenance is expensive, etc. 
* To sanity check these figures, I went and looked at the SEC filings of Invitation Homes which owns 80,000 single family homes in the US. In 2019, Invitation Homes made ~$1.764 billion on rent + other property income while spending a combine ~$730 million on property maintenance + management.(49) . That’s about ~41% of the total property income, which aligns with the rental calculator above (rent payments fo 1300 vs ~$570 for maintenance, taxes, insurance, vacancy, etc.). That honestly makes me nervous however, as Invitation Homes theoretically has the scale to centralize and minimize maintenance costs. While I could certainly substitute “sweat equity” for some repairs, it strikes me that it would be foolish to assume my costs would be lower than Invitation Homes’


&amp;nbsp;


**401k analysis**

As I mentioned above, one of the big questions around real estate investing that I rarely see asked is “is it an appreciably better investment than the alternatives”? For W2 workers, which is ~50% of private sector workers, this question becomes even more pertinent because 401ks have massive tax benefits. In fact, only 33% of US households own taxable accounts outside of a 401k, which means the vast bulk of US households either have no accounts, 38%, or own only a retirement account like a 401k, 29%, according to (39). Let’s assume we have a middle to upper middle class worker making ~70k (this puts them roughly at the 75% percentile). They want to invest, and see two options: 

* Invest $20,000 post-tax in a downpayment  on a $200,000 investment property just like in the above analysis (we’ll assume closing costs just get baked into the final net gain) 
* Invest the equivalent amount of post-tax dollars into their 401k. You can probably see where I’m going with this by the use of “post-tax”. 


&amp;nbsp;


At a salary of $70k and assuming you took the $12k standard deduction, you would still see much of your income fall into the 22% tax bracket. While certain states charge no income tax, they generally make it up in much higher sales / property taxes, so let’s also assume a 3% state income tax (40). This means that if you invest $19,500 in a 401k (the maximum in 2020) that’s equivalent to only $14,625 post-tax (because the $19,500 would be taxed ~25% before it got to you). That leaves almost $6000 when compared with the down payment figure above, which is coincidentally the exact IRA contribution limit for 2020! The math for deductions for the IRA gets painful, but we can assume a deduction of ~$1500 (i.e. 25% of 6000). Now, if your work offers an HSA it gets even better, because those contributions are tax-free even from social security (which is typically a 6.2% tax) + medicaid (1.45%). This means that if you contribute the $3500 limit, that’s equivalent to only $2300 post-tax. 


&amp;nbsp;


This is getting rather long, so for the sake of simplicity we can basically say that in lieu of putting down a $20,000 post-tax downpayment on an investment property you could instead invest $19500 + $6000 + $3500 = $29000 into the stock market. What’s more, fees for well managed 401ks through Vanguard, Schwab are often ~0.25% (i.e. $72 annually on the $29k above). 


&amp;nbsp;


If we assume the average S&amp;P 500 index returns of 10% (we’ll ignore the $72 annually in expenses and of course there are no taxes), we would see $29k compounded over 5 years = $47,809. Since we’re investing the money all immediately, this is (I believe) more or less equivalent to the IRR rate. 


&amp;nbsp;


So, what do we need to achieve to beat that return with our investment property? Well, we previously assumed a blistering 5% real home price appreciation. With inflation at ~2%, that’s a nominal 7% home price appreciation. According to both Zillow and Core logic, Idaho is the state with the fastest home appreciation values pre-COVID at ~9%. We’re essentially predicting close to this level for 5 years, which is quite rare. In August 2019, US home prices nationally were gaining ~2.6% according to (41).

Let’s plug those numbers into our rental property calculator from above. At a 10% down payment, 3.5% interest rate, and 2.6% home price appreciation we see an IRR of 18% per year. Game, set, match, real estate, right?


&amp;nbsp;


Well, sort of. Right now we are assuming optimistic projections about maintenance (1%), closing costs (2%), and selling costs (4%). What if we bump those up to the averages cited by Zillow (3% and 8%)? Uh-oh, now we’re down to 12.38%. Okay, but what if we assume rent goes up by the same amount, ~2%? Great! Now we’re back up to 14% IRR. But if we assume all the other expenses like home insurance and maintenance go up 2% a year as well, we’re back down to 11%. 


&amp;nbsp;



We could go on forever, but the point is that real estate (particularly for rental properties) are extremely sensitive to assumptions you make on a number of factors. Given the risk, illiquidity, and work involved with a real estate property I would want to see a substantially higher return than the tax advantaged, hands off 10% my 401k gives me. I didn’t even include the typical 3% match for the 401k, which would have added $2100 to the initial investment amount and increased the 5 year return to $51,272.


&amp;nbsp;



The bottom line in my mind is that for most W2 workers who have access to pre-tax investments, they should max them out first. If you’re lucky enough to be able to max out all of the above pre-tax accounts + get a 3% match (i.e. $31k total) every year, after 15 years at a 10% return you’ll have $1.2 million. In 30 years you’ll have $6.8 million. And again, keep in mind that maxing out your pre-tax accounts only “costs” you ~$20k, because that’s what you would get after taxes. And you’ll have “made” those millions without spending a single hour outside of your day job working. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Based on the above analysis and calculations, here’s what I’ve come away with as a newbie to real estate investing:**


* Real estate investing involves significant risk. Achieving high returns relies upon either significant home appreciation or accurately calculating several key inputs (rental rates, maintenance costs, etc.). The past decades strong home appreciation has likely saved some investors from faulty assumptions, simply because their highly leveraged investment increased in value
* Given the significant transaction, maintenance, tax, and other costs simply buying and living in a single family home is not guaranteed to build substantial wealth in the short term (i.e. &lt; 10 years) even with significant price appreciation. 
* The story of real estate investing is really the story of credit availability. Low interest rates, widespread credit, etc. allow investors to take on significant leverage and potentially achieve high returns. On the flip side, if credit tightens we could see substantial movements in real estate as valuations adjust to the more expensive or less available leverage 
* Personally, I would want to see at least 12+% returns annually before I invested in real estate directly vs. a diversified stock portfolio. Potentially having a cash flow negative, illiquid, highly leveraged asset is a risk that I want to be compensated for by a higher return. Obviously there are many advantages to real estate I’ve not yet learned in depth about (e.g. taxes), so perhaps this premium will change slightly in my mind in the future
* If you’re a younger, W2 wage earning in the US with the access and ability to contribute to a 401k, IRA, and HSA you should do that first before even considering real estate investing. The tax advantages are immense, the time investment is essentially nothing, and historically you are guaranteed, at the absolute worst, a 6.5% annualized return if you wait for 35 years. Plus a well diversified 401k fund, like a Vanguard target retirement fund, may very well include REITs
* The exception here of course is doing something like house hacking, etc. where you are combining your primary residence with an investment. I’m not sophisticated enough yet to run the numbers there, but it seems reasonable on the surface 


&amp;nbsp;


**Some thoughts on the future:**

Forecasting is always risky, but at the same time we all have to form an opinion on where the future is headed. My general thoughts are that crisis tend to accelerate existing trends rather than create new ones. There were already recession concerns in late 2019, and US GDP growth expectations had been downgraded to ~2.0% by the OECD even before COVID (45), albeit with slight optimism around the Phase 1 trade deal with China.  Geopolitical tension and capital controls in China had led to mainland Chinese investors slowing their investments in US real estate and increasing dispositions (47). 

* While there is certainly a housing shortage, even in high growth states we see housing “deficits” according to Fannie Mae of ~5%. While this is clearly substantial, shifting migration patterns, regulatory changes, household preferences (e.g. telecommuting) could easily shift the balance. It’s far from certain in my mind that housing will remain supply constrained in the medium term (i.e. &gt; 3 years) 
* In December 2019, Zillow was already forecasting slowing home price and rental appreciation to modest 2.8% &amp; 2.3% respectively (42) 
* As of March 31 2020, Zillow now forecasts home price appreciation at -1.5% nationally. 
* We are seeing tightening mortgage credit, particularly for jumbo loans that are essentially for high priced real estate markets (44). Mortgage services, i.e. non-bank companies like Quicken, have been hit hard by the mortgage forbearance regulations (although relief measures have been enacted) 
* The CBO is currently forecasting the unemployment rate to remain &gt;10% until 2021 (48). Even if that proves wildly pessimistic, it’s highly probably that the tepid wage gains of the last few years will slow further or even reverse 
* Ultimately with  slowing wage gains and reduced credit in the short term it is hard to see how consumers retain their purchasing power to drive rents / real estate prices substantially higher. 
* On the flip side, central banks globally have injected trillions of dollars of liquidity into the global economy. This has driven down yields in traditional safe havens, e.g. investment grade corporate and sovereign bonds. The question becomes, where does this money go? Does it favor real estate over stocks? Does it lead to inflation, deflation, stagflation? 
* Local &amp; state governments are facing massive budget shortfalls due to dramatically lower revenues (e.g. sales taxes) and higher costs (unemployment insurance, healthcare, etc.). If the federal government does not backstop these revenues, will we see higher state / local taxes or cutbacks in services? 
* As mentioned previously, the tax law changes of 2017 dramatically affected how individuals / households approach their federal taxes. In particular, it is now far less advantageous to itemize property taxes, state taxes, mortgage interest, etc. Mark Zandi (50) of Moody’s analytics provided some interesting analysis that suggested the tax law changes had already impacted higher cost markets. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue, accelerate, or reverse post COVID. 
* The question now becomes how investors, particularly those who entered late in the cycle and lack substantial equity buffers, will deal with conditions. A V shaped recovery would likely see minimal disruption as investors are able to cope with disrupted cash flows for several months. A longer recession would see over-leveraged investors forced to short-sell properties 
* I’m particularly struck by the fact that according to at least one source (27) ~72% of first time home buyers put down 6% or less. These recent buyers lack the equity buffer to deal with any material decline in housing prices, while the modest down payment suggests they may also lack substantial cash reserves to deal with an economic shock. 
* There also seems to me a disconnect between commercial and residential real estate I don’t fully understand. Take a well capitalized and diversified REIT like Brookfield Property Partners. This REIT is currently offering a 14%+ yield. Of course many of their properties like urban office / retail space are getting hammered by COVID. But if we’re assuming that centrally located, urban commercial office &amp; retail spaces are substantially less valuable than pre-COVID, what does that say more broadly about dense urban real estate? After all, if people work from home and don’t go out to commercial real estate spaces, why bother paying a premium in living expenses? 

From my point of view, I’m interested in seeing how the market reacts over the next 3-6 months. Do sellers react by rapidly putting properties on the market before it’s “too late”? Are there enough prime  buyers given the tightening credit, particularly for expensive coastal markets, to absorb a spike in listings? As Warren Buffett once said: “""At rare and unpredictable intervals...credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian-roulette equation--usually win, occasionally die--may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company's upside but does not share in its downside.” We shall see.

Enter copper.  Copper bathroom and kitchen hardware has been used and tested in the past, however due to the cost it never became mainstream.  With COVID-19, the cost of cleaning out a stainless steel surface (which can harbor COVID-19 for up to 3 days) will be prohibitive.  With copper surfaces, after 4 hours, without disinfectant, the virus dies - less labor, less disinfectant, and a lower cost over time will increase demand for copper surfaces.

EMERYVILLE, Calif., April 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. ([GO](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=go))  (the “Company”) today announced the pricing of an underwritten public  offering by certain selling stockholders of the Company, including the  selling stockholder affiliated with Hellman &amp; Friedman LLC (the  “H&amp;F Investor”), of 15,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock  at an initial price to the public of $34.00 per share.  The offering is  expected to close on April 27, 2020, subject to customary closing  conditions.

785,t3_g950vc,investing,The textbook disconnect and how it may affect the market.,"Just some obervations I have. Open for discussion.

In the past we learnt that bonds and stocks usually moves in opposite direction. However over the past few years, companies issued more bonds to garner cash, and that cash was used to purchase their own stocks. Boeing is one such company. The whole operation started slowing down in january.

Why I think a V shape recovery is unlikely. The stock movements for the past few years were fueled by stock buy backs, often with issuance of corporate bonds. What we’ve read from company earnings now, is that companies started to conserve cash, some scrapped dividends and reduced buy backs. The junk bond market swelled and all desperate to look for buyers. Yes the feds are printing money, whether it is enough to save all will be another question. This rise is fueled by FOMO and speculation.

I believe some stocks will stand to benefit from this lock down. Such as amazon and costco etc. More sales going online is not equal to more sales online. I’ve been tracking big ticket items and electronics on amazon, majority are buying necessities and not luxury items. So the upcoming reports will be interesting to see whether this theory holds up.

My 2 cents.

TLDR: With every other company hoarding up cash for the unknown ahead, stock buy backs will be greatly reduced. Hence no V shape recovery."

Spectrum (SPB) and Service Master (SERV) have small exposure to that, but they are tiny slivers of their business.

[https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-hca34-da92da](https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-hca34-da92da)

Normally, there are shorts who are willing to take on long contracts from, say USO. However, as storage disappears, there won't be any shorts to take the long positions from USO as they try to roll them over to the next month. And the longs, which USO has taken on, are from producers who have every intention to deliver physical product. In the end, you may have extreme negative oil-future prices. What happens then? USO is shutdown, but then who is holding the bag and has to make up the loss? The brokerage? The exchange? The government? (that's my attempt at an explanation)

I'm a small retail investor, and I don't hold any USO. But I am concerned. What happens if an exchange is impacted, like Robinhood (I'm with Questrade in Canada)? What happens to all the retail investors in Robinhood?"
788,t3_g93g5j,investing,Is there a trailing effect time bomb that's going to kill retail CRE over the next 6-18 months?,"Commercial real estate is generally valued using a cap rate on net operating income. Deals are financed over 5-7 years with a much longer amortization period. Some loans are interest only, but even those that aren't are very interest heavy, thanks to amortization. The average cap rate in CRE for retail  the past few years has been quite low (\~5%).

We're now at the point where a massive number of retail businesses have been closed for 30-60 days, with a large number of those businesses likely paying no rent at all or a discounted rate. It seems likely that a large swath of those businesses will fail, unfortunately. It also seems likely that even when things re-open, you'll have (1) Consumers who are wary of public places like restaurants, etc (especially  older people, who also have more disposable cash) and (2) people who can't afford to shop or eat out as often because they haven't been working for 2 months.

All of the above means an unavoidable drop in NOI and therefore value, that's going to force some owners to pay out of pocket to cover the loss when they refinance, at which time we can assume some owners will just walk away (especially those with vacancies due to businesses failing). This will have a cascading affect that'll push cap rates up, driving values even lower across the sector. 

Just a thought: I'm going to see if there are any REIT ETFs that may be exposed and see what puts are doing."

790,t3_g928u3,investing,What do you think of my modification of Ray Dalio's All-Weather Portfolio?,"Dalio's public All-Weather portfolio is 30% stocks, 40% long term treasuries, 15% intermediate term treasuries, 7.5% gold, 7.5% commodities. If implemented suing ETFs, conventional wisdom would implement it like this:

30% VFINX, 40% VUSTX, 15% VFITX, 15% GLD (for lack of a way to get commodity exposure, I just doubled up on the gold allocation). Starting in Feb 2008, according to [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com), this portfolio yielded about 7.3% CAGR, and had a standard deviation of about 7.3%, and a maximum drawdown of 12.8% in 2008. Assume yearly rebalancing.

Here's my improvement and my reason why: IF we can find an even more volatile bond fund, we could increase the allocation of equity &amp; equity-like assets. There are two such funds out there: EDV and ZROZ. Both of these are extended duration, which means more price volatility &amp; interest rate risk. Because these funds zig when equities zag, we can increase the amount of equity-like exposure in our portfolio.

Instead of adding stocks, I will add leveraged middle market debt instead, specifically Business Development Companies (BDCs). These are essentially banks that solely lend to middle-market companies. Middle market debt has the characteristics of junk bonds - high yield, but equity-like risk. Because the bulk of the returns are paid out in the form of dividends and NOT share appreciation, BDCs can provide a consistent equity-like return. The best managed BDCs are MAIN and ARCC.

So, here's my modified All-Weather portolfio:

40% EDV, 30% VUSTX (stocks), 10% MAIN, 10% ARCC, and 10% gold. According to [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://portfoliovisualizer.com), starting in Feb 2008, this portfolio yielded about 11.9% CAGR, had a standard deviation of about 11.2%, and had a maximum drawdown of 17.7% in 2008.

In performance, my modified All-Weather portfolio behaves a lot like the original All-Weather portfolio, but leveraged up to a 50% debt/equity ratio, but without using any leverage at all - hence it's suitable for retirement account portfolios. I'm 28, and I'm seriously considering committing this asset allocation for ever inside my 401K and Roth IRA - it's got a nice balance return &amp; volatility.

What does the reddit world think of this idea? Good? Bad? Do you see any problems with it? Please let me know!"

But I would appreciate expert opinions
793,t3_g91dlv,investing,"HCQ harmful, Remdesevir unhelpful, a quick review of the next steps for COVID-19.","  So last (and shortest) update on Convalescent Plasma in Covid-19, please look through my previous posts about prior discussions on the treatments in Sars-Cov2/COVID-19 and why I predicted HCQ to be harmful/unhelpful and why I wasn't excited on Remdesevir or other antivirals as a class of medicine. 

With the recent not great hint of results on remdesivir, this makes me more bullish on my previously discussed treatment options. At this point, as I pointed out about a month ago, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be largely unhelpful in changing mortality/possibly harmful (our ICU has largely stopped giving it as well) and now remdesivir which had a slightly higher chance of showing clinical effectiveness is likely not helpful. Both of these medications come with risks limiting their use. 

Conversely there are much less side effects/risks to convalescent plasma.  Our main therapies outside of supportive care so far have not been effective against COVID-19 (which I unfortunately expected and outlined in previous posts). 

The last treatment option with previously demonstrated results would be convalescent plasma. As a quick primer, we take the blood/plasma of people that have already made antibodies that kill COVID-19, isolate those antibodies and inject it into people that are suffering from COVID-19. This is what a vaccine aims to do but we’re shortcutting the vaccine production, testing and the bodies response and just giving the antibodies directly. 

Plasma has been used and shown effective in almost every viral disease but is limited by collection; finding a subset of patients with proper antibodies, and getting them to donate plasma. 

As a big disclaimer: This would technically still not be a proven treatment because we’re dealing with a new virus but in my mind it’s about as proven (theoretically, mechanistically and notably on prior models of disease) as you can get in medicine this early on (Prior to large RCTs).

**Convalescent Plasma during the outbreak**: Previously limited by collection during the initial parts of the pandemic (due to small amount of patient with the virus and the logistics involved) plasma will soon flourish and become the standard for severe/life threatening patients with COVID-19. As an immunomodulatory agent I believe it will show mortality benefit given improvement in cytokine storm effects all while also directly decreasing COVID-19 antibodies. 

Logistics surrounding its collection have been fine tuned in the recent weeks through vitalant and the red cross. And initial studies on effectiveness will be released soon that I expect will have th ebest results so far in comparison to other studies. This will likely mirror effectiveness versus previous similar virus’s noted in my previous discussion (Decreased mortality and got people off vents quicker in SARS1, MERS, H1N1). At the time, widespread use against those other viruses was limited by small infected population size and other options being available. An issue we thankfully(?) don’t seem to have with COVID-19. (You need like 4-10 people to make a bag of plasma, so you need 4-10 people that have cleared the virus and are willing to donate to be able to treat one patient.) 

As antibody tests role out to define who is immune, plasma collection agencies role out marketing to collect plasma (and pay people a few hundred bucks, people that are out of a job otherwise), as initial ‘verification’ level research starts to trickle in, and as we run out of other options… this makes an amazing opportunity in the convalescent plasma marketplace as previously defined. 

Counter to that, you get the stability of buying into a market with a predefined CAGR of \~7%. Plasma/IVIG is a drug in that has and will continue to be used for a long time.  It treats diseases that people can’t avoid treatment for, have no cure, and need repeat treatments. (stable baseline market requiring at least 1-2 years of infusions and sometimes lifelong infusions. 

Stable market limiting downside. COVID-19 treatment with massive upside. 

The only derailing instrument to this would be a vaccine at this point, which is 6 month – multiple years out. (As previously discussed, the heterogeneity of the cell surface proteins in COVID-19 make it harder than usual to make a vaccine against… and we’ve never made a vaccine against a coronavirus subclass before… all that to say, the vaccine is likely a while away and the first few will almost invariably fail to show clinical effectiveness as all vaccine production processess usually do unfortunately. 

**Companies**: **CSL Behring**/**CSLLY-CSL.asx, Takeda Pharm/TAK, Grifols/GRFS**, Kedrion, Baxter, Biotest, BPL, LFB, Octapharma, Emergent Biosolutions.

Many of these companies have already started to spike in price and are close to returning to pre-COVID valuations but I believe the roof on them is still very high.

&gt; **Valuation**  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking deeper at the valuation, DEAC currently trades at a \~$900 million valuation. From the combined income statement, the combined entity did $323 million in sales, up \~40% YoY. With a gross margin of \~60%, a business like this usually trades for well above 4x revenue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking the case of 4x revenue, and projecting a 20% growth rate into 2020 to account for coronavirus, we get to $387 million of 2020 revenue. Applying a conservative 4x EV/Sales multiple results in a valuation of $1.6 billion. *This suggests a 77% upside from today's levels. Given that we may be underestimating the multiple or overestimating the growth, a sensitivity would still show 50%+ upside from today's levels.*"

812,t3_g8tas7,investing,DraftKings (DKNG) is a BUY at $20 - Well Positioned for U.S. Market Leadership and Weathering the COVID-19 Crisis.,"CORRECTION: DKNG IS A SMALL POSITION BUY AND WATCH

Due to the nature of the reverse merger IPO, we did a data check on our automated market cap pull, which actually turned out to be &gt;$3.3B. Because of this, the P/S ratio is now &gt;8.2, meaning is priced high compared to its competitors. However, there is a lot of positive sentiment, as we outlined, for DKNG which could drive its stock price higher as people price in future value. We are going to take a small position at market open and continue to watch DKNG closely and dollar cost average over time. Apologies for any confusion our initial post may have caused. The reverse merger IPO is not common and therefore a lot of databases do not accurately reflect the actual market cap for DKNG right now. Buying at $10 per share is more reasonable.

\---

While we primarily focus on biotech, we are opportunistic investors and love to invest in high-growth startups that are revolutionizing their industries. DraftKings (DKNG) is a high-growth startup that recently IPO'd through a reverse merger last Friday and saw a 10% increase in value on their first day of trading, ending the day with a market cap of $950M. DKNG's IPO amid the pause of sports during the COVID-19 crisis has some people scratching their heads, but after conducting an opportunity assessment and financial diligence on DKNG, we believe it is a BUY and is well positioned to continue leading online sports betting and also breaking into the online casino space.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why we think DKNG is well positioned as a growth stock:

&amp;#x200B;

1. DKNG is in close competition with FanDuel for market leadership in U.S. sports betting. When consumers were asked to list companies offering daily fantasy sports and sportsbetting, DKNG was top of mind for a quarter of interviewees while it was the preferred brand for almost a third of consumers. We personally conducted several consumer interviews on their preferred daily fantasy sports and sports betting companies and DKNG ranked top, with consumers citing the platform as more ""user-friendly."" Furthermore, consumers cited more attractive promotions with better odds offered by DKNG than FanDuel in order to drive user adoption and retention. In a competitive space like this, it's promising that DKNG is focused on customer acquisition and retention.

&amp;#x200B;

2. DKNG is quick to penetrate markets upon online sports betting legalization. DKNG has a track record of moving quick to acquire customers when states legalize online sports betting. For example, DKNG moved quick to win the exclusive bid in New Hampshire and quickly turned online in Pennsylvania when legalization occurred. While DKNG is surely no longer a startup, their talented and driven team is versatile and quick to address make-or-break situations that allow them to take market share quickly. With so many states on the cusp of legalizing online sports betting, it's easy to see upside and growth potential in online sports betting. DKNG is well positioned to take a significant share of that growing market.

&amp;#x200B;

3. DKNG's diverse set of offerings allow them to weather the sports shutdown caused by COVID-19. While DKNG is known for daily fantasy sports and sports betting, it's diversified greatly into e-sports (e.g., League of Legends, Counter-Strike) and online casino (e.g., Blackjack). In the month of March, internet gaming revenue (excluding sports wagers) in New Jersey rose 66% in March, to $65 million. Clearly, while sports are out of commission, DKNG will benefit from the rise in online gambling and the continued interest in e-sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

4. DKNG is positioned to expand the online casino industry by making online gambling mainstream. Daily fantasy sports and online sports betting is arguably much more mainstream than online casino gambling. Consumers perceive fantasy sports and sports betting to be a skill and information-based game while online casino gambling as sheer luck. DKNG is positioned to link the two together by bringing consumers onto the platform through daily fantasy sports and sports betting and having them dip their toes in the online casino through promos. The adjacency of its sports betting and online casino offerings creates a powerful pipeline that has the opportunity to make online casino gambling more mainstream and DKNG may be at the forefront of it.

&amp;#x200B;

5. The reverse merger provided $500M in cash to DKNG, which will help DKNG through the COVID-19 crisis. In the reverse merger, DKNG has access to $500M in cash, which is enough to cover its average operating costs for approximately 2.5 years. There may be headcount cuts to look out for as they've hired significantly in the past two years and their general &amp; administrative costs has increased almost 100% since last year. However, DKNG's  increased cash position with the reverse merger will definitely help it weather through the suspension in sports.

&amp;#x200B;

6. At $20 per share, DKNG is fairly priced compared to its competitors based on its price-to-sales ratio (P/S). DKNG has a P/S of 2.9 compared to Stars Group, FanDuel, and Churchill Downs, which have P/S ratios of 4.1, 3.7, and 2.6 respectively. DKNG is more similar to Stars group and FanDuel given they have more of an online presence and higher growth potential. Churchill Downs on the other hand owns several horse racing tracks and is less poised for growth and therefore has a lower P/S ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, we perceive DKNG as a buy. It's currently a leader in the space and is well positioned to maintain leadership in the U.S. market with its fast-moving team and diverse offering of games. While COVID-19-driven suspension of sports is concerning, the company has money on hand from the reverse merger IPO and has several revenue streams that are not impacted by the suspension of sports. As long as states continue to lift online sports betting and gambling restrictions, DKNG will be waiting to charge into the new markets."

814,t3_g8t14p,investing,Why markets rise on unemployment,"It's all about cash flows. Your stock is equity in a company, and when there's a demand shock, your employees are a net expense that reduce cashflows. When there's a lack of supply, employees are net positive because they produce goods and services that the company can sell for more later -&gt; hire to meet demand.

Layoffs and unemployment increase net cashflows in companies during times like this. This has been seen in past recessions when stocks would rise when a company announces layoffs.

Remember, the economy and the stock market are not the same thing. What serves the shareholder's interests is not always what serves the economy's interests; e.g. laying off Sears employees to strip the company's assets and make a profit -&gt; negative for the economy, positive for shareholders. As investors, you invest cash to generate more cash: paying employees to do nothing is counterproductive.

A little throwback to 2013: [https://buzz.money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/layoffs-stocks/](https://buzz.money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/layoffs-stocks/)

I'm looking at putting a lot of my portfolio into buying 2022 LEAP calls on XLE. My thesis is that the US energy sector is currently very oversold due to the virus/oil crash, but will recover much of its value in the next 1-3 years.

My plan is to purchase OTM calls and roll them forward periodically until my price target is met. At that point, I will close my positions and switch to a different investment.

I'm very skeptical of the ""V-shaped recovery,"" and I expect demand for energy to be suppressed over the next couple years, so I'm aiming at a target below the last decade's average. I'm looking for around ~$55/share, versus XLE's current price of ~$35. 

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this strategy. I have several questions.

Most importantly,

* Do you agree with my thesis? How convincing is the counter-argument?

I'd also welcome suggestions on several technical points:

* How far OTM should I buy? Is it mathematically better to do this in a single far-OTM purchase, or should I do it in smaller steps, periodically closing positions and buying new ones at higher strikes?

* How frequently should I roll the contracts forward? Are there certain conditions I should look for (e.g. doing so during a low-volatility period)?

* I expect volatility to revert toward its historical mean over the next 2 years. Should I hedge against this by buying puts on some VIX derivative? Or should that money just go toward more XLE calls? (If hedging, how do I scale the hedge, and why aren't I better off just putting volatility in the first place if it's that important?)

* I'm planning to buy most of this position on Friday, after XOM/CVX earnings, in hopes of entering on a relatively low-volatility day (and maybe a lower entry point if earnings are a bloodbath). Reasonable?

Obviously concern has escalated and right now we are at around 1/3 of Americans are 'very concerned', 38% are 'somewhat concerned', and 28% are 'not very' or 'not at all' concerned. 

Public fear peaked a couple weeks ago when the stay at home orders were well underway and there was still fear about the coronavirus worst case scenarios playing out. 

I struggle to see how fear could rise to that level again unless reopening strategies go terribly. This could also provide insight on how hotels, restaurants, and other corona hit industries could recover.

I made sure to allocate 10% to bonds as a hedge against market crashes, and also kept 15-20% in international stocks to remain geographically diversified. I also weighted my portfolio towards smaller cap and value stocks as historically they are more profitable compared to large-cap and growth stocks.  I have two slightly different versions, but the one I'm using only has about 10% in large-cap us stocks (half s&amp;p 500 half QQQ) while a whopping 60% is in small-cap and small-cap value stocks. I also included a low-carbon target ETF position as I believe the importance and value of companies that do not rely upon fossil fuels rather than renewable energy are vastly underrated. I understand that this portfolio is much more volatile and high beta compared to safer blue-chip ETFs and portfolios with larger bond positions, but I prefer a more aggressive approach as I am still very young and long term this is likely to be much more profitable. When I get older I will likely begin allocating more of my portfolio to bonds.

825,t3_g8mmp6,investing,Break Even Point of Value Investing,"I've become interested in investing and specifically value investing a la Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Benjamin Graham, etc. However, I'm also a Project Manager and we often analyze business cases for new projects against one another and against our internal rate of return. With this in mind I've been thinking about the ""project"" of embarking into value investing and whether or not it is a worthwhile use of time compared to investing in a simple passive ETF portfolio. I was wondering if anyone has done something similar? This is a 100% mental masturbation exercise but I'm hoping people here can refine my thinking: 

My thought process and questions: 

1. Long term, based on past performance, I can reasonably expect a return of about 6% just investing in index funds (I don't have source but I hear about this number often). So the ""project"" of value investing has to have an equally reasonable expectation that I will get much more than 6% because my time is valuable. Is this a reasonable expectation and does it only become reasonable if you have enough capital to properly diversify (lets assume trading fees are negligible)? 
2. Assuming learning and analyzing companies are something I like to do how many hours per year would be required for me to return more than 6%? Of course I could spend 1 hour and get lucky but how many hours would be required to be 90% confident my return would be between 10-20%? 
3. If I value my time at $50/hour how much does it ""cost"" me to get more than 6% return? 
4. What happens if you have a hard cap on the hours you can spend analyzing companies? Is there a minimum number of hours required for it to become worth while? 
5. Could you determine, based on the limited time you have to research, a specific percentage you should allocate towards stock picking vs ETF purchasing. For example, if I only have 3 hours per week should I only use 5% of my portfolio for stock picking?"

So basically most books about Investing I've read say that recessions are the best time for investing, and you should be brave when people are fearful, I think it's a great time buy Boeing stock since people will have to fly sometime soon , and the gov won't let the company leading in airplane manufacturing just die, so buying it at a 60% discount is a great long term investment (5 years+)

I have been toying with the idea of moving my VTI to VTSAX because I can set up automatic investments in VTSAX, which would allow me to be a less emotional investor than I currently am while I watch VTI and try to ""time"" when to go in. 

I understand that VTSAX needs $3000 buy in and I have heard that people switch their VTI to VTSAX rather than buying a new $3000 of VTSAX to buy in. My question is- Is it okay to do this whenever or are there times when transfering from VTI to VTSAX would be better than others? If there are, how can I best determine when that would be? Should I wait for the market to recover?

830,t3_g8kwpa,investing,"Reuters: Russia is considering resorting to burning its oil to take it off the market, Continental Resources Inc abruptly shutting wells in Oklahoma and North Dakota","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-turmoil/when-oil-became-waste-a-week-of-turmoil-for-crude-and-more-pain-to-come-idUSKCN228059

&gt; In Russia, one of the world’s top producers, the industry is considering resorting to burning its oil to take it off the market, sources told Reuters. 

&gt; U.S. billionaire Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources Inc sent servicers out into fields in Oklahoma and North Dakota in the middle of the week to abruptly shut wells, and the company declared it could not make crude deliveries to customers due to poor economics.

&gt; Continental’s decision to declare force majeure - usually reserved for wars, accidents or natural disasters - came as a shock, bringing a sharp response from the leading refinery industry group. But some say there is a logic behind it, even if it may not pass muster in court.

&gt; “You sign contracts based on the average norms that a society has experienced over the last 100 years. If we have a new event that is not covered by those norms, it goes into force majeure. That’s what Harold Hamm and others are saying - that these are circumstances outside the norm,” said Anas Alhajji, an energy market expert based in Dallas. 

&gt; Azerbaijan, part of the group of nations known as OPEC+, is forcing a BP-led group to cut output for the first time ever. Oil majors in those countries have generally been excluded from government-imposed cuts.

&gt; “We have never done it before since they came to the country in 1994 and signed the contract of the century,” a senior Azeri official told Reuters. 

&gt; That accommodation can no longer be made with the world running out of space to put oil. As of Thursday, energy researcher Kpler said onshore storage worldwide is now roughly 85% full. 

&gt; “I’m sure hearing the same numbers about demand destruction of 20 to 30 million barrels a day,” said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy, who was working at the New York Mercantile Exchange when U.S. crude futures were launched in 1983. “Until we see some kind of alleviation of that, you have to wonder what is in store.”"

832,t3_g8iycl,investing,Some of my personal investment habits. Totally Arbitrary. Maybe Stupid.,"Been investing myself for a little over three years. Have been posting replies in r/investing for a while and figure it may be time for me to share some of my own investment habits. Again, not scientific, not pro, totally arbitrary, maybe full of stupidity, as I am NOT a financial/econ/investment/business professional.

\-I believe investment starts with budgeting. I made a monthly budget and calculated how much money I have left after usual expenditure and putting away emergency savings. Then I invest 60%-70% of my remaining money; the rest I put into high-yield savings account or let it sit for several months and open a CD somdwhere.

\-I just have a.....paranoid obsession with diversification. After three years of playing with the market I now own a portfolio of more than 15 stocks, a couple REITS, 15+ ETFs (including one gold ETF) and four mutual funds. Many of these I have only say 0.5-1K of money invested in. I am just convinced that going into diversification helps disperse and mitigate risk. My gold ETF has made up for some of the losses in the current market downturn, but with everything turned to shit I am not better off than anybody else. I also use ETFs to gain exposure to foreign markets I cannot directly buy into. The same obsession applies to bank accounts: I have accounts in several banks to spread my savings.

\-When I first started buying stocks, I used to find the portfolio of a specific ETF in a specific sector that I have a positive view on, find their top 5-10 holdings of stocks, check their dividend info, and buy the one with highest dividend yield. Kinda like letting the ""smarter"" people do the picking for me while not having to entrust my money with them. (And later I found that the portfolio changes frequently :p)

\-I consider myself a dividend investor and I prefer stocks with high dividend yield. But I also want to reap profit from time to time. I made myself a rule: if a stock's unrealized upward gain equals 15-20 years of average dividend and I do not plan to hold it long term, I sell it, keep the gains, and then reinvest roughly the same amount of original principals into another stock. This makes me sell a stock or two and then buy one or two every quarter. Kinda stupid thinking backward, but hey I do want to get some fast cash out of my stocks from time to time. I was able to cash out some of my gains at the top of S&amp;P500 last year with this strategy; still I am hit hard by the current turmoil.

\-I buy both physical gold bars/coins and gold ETF. Say what you like or don't like about gold, but people are so accustomed to fleeing into gold amid turmoil, it still is a safe haven asset in the foreseeable future I believe.

\-I don't buy any, ANY stock from Chinese companies listed in the US. I don't even hold an ETF of Chinese stocks and market---I can't control if some of my ETFs/Funds have exposure to Chinese companies, but I just don't buy anything focused on China. One reason is that my family is in China and they already invest inChinese market, but there is also another lesson learned by myself. Having worked part time at a financial website for a year and having translated many documents and interviews of Chinese companies, I just know how much shit these companies put out just to get listed in the US. This is absolutely not rational and I know it. This also makes me miss huge gains of Alibaba, Baidu etc but I am very firm at staying away from Chinese companies. The same principle I think should apply to Hong Kong stock exchange. There are just so many shitty Chinese companies listed there.

\-Yes I do buy actively managed mutual funds. Obsession with diversification is one reason. But I do believe that actively managed funds have a slightly better chance of hedging against risks than passive or index funds/ETFs (not that I don't buy them). Currently, my conservative strategy mutual fund is doing better than my moderate strategy one, recording a positive.

\-I realize that mentality is an important and tricky thing. A lot of investors are not very unsettled by losing money but will regret enormously not being able to reap profit that they believe they ""should have"" gained. I try very hard to escape from this type of mentality. I only seek to beat the inflation with my dividend. I've recorded a steady 3%-4% dividend yield from my portfolio in the past few years (not counting gains from selling stocks) and I am happy with it.

\-I don't have any virtual currency holdings. If only I had the guts to buy some Bitcoin a few years back (compare with the last statement to see irony LOL).

\-Resources that I frequently rely on:

Bloomberg: subscribed for monthly subscription. News source.

[Dividend.com](https://Dividend.com): subscribed for premium to track my dividend stock ratings and yield.

Investopedia: frequent go-to website for knowledge and terms.

[etfdb.com](https://etfdb.com): did not subscribe but I frequently check this website for ETF recommendations and info (limited in free edition). Seems to come from the same team that operates [dividend.com](https://dividend.com).

Happy investing and best of luck to everyone! Hope we will get through these difficult times and come out stronger.

**Company:** Inspire Medical Systems (INSP)

**Short call by:** Wolfpack Research on 4/23/2020

**Thesis:** Inspire is a medical technology company that makes a surgically implanted device for treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Wolfpack believes the cure is worse than the disease, as 85% of patients have suffered an adverse event, including temporary paralysis and electrical shock. Potential dangers include nerve damage and battery fluid leaking into the body. The scary side effects could be behind the reason why despite being offered for free to 9 million U.S. veterans since 2014, only 387 have elected to have the surgery. Wolfpack believes the total addressable market is overstated by a factor of 50x in Inspire’s marketing copy.

**Company:** Mirati Therapeutics, Inc (MRTX)

**Short call by:** Kerrisdale Capital on 4/23/2020

**Thesis:** Mirati is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company who produces MRTX-849, a drug that is a small-molecule KRAS inhibitor (KRASi). Mirati has released Phase I data showing that their KRASi are capable of shrinking tumors in second-line treatment of patients with KRAS-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer. Taking into account the low response rate of patients and the short duration of responses, Kerrisdale believes the data indicates an extremely low chance of approval. Kerrisdale also points to an influx of new competitors taking differentiated approaches to targeting KRAS, who they believe will be more effective.

**Company:** Akazoo S.A. (SONG)

**Short call by:** Quintessential Capital Management on 4/20/2020

**Thesis:** Akazoo is an online music streaming company (think Spotify). Akazoo’s financials claim sales of $145M and EBIDTA of $10M, but Quintessential believes these numbers are highly inflated. They point out that Akazoo has been burning $4M in cash per year and paying 0 income taxes, despite claiming profits of $22M over the last 4 years. Furthermore, compared to its competitors, Akazoo’s app has a suspiciously low number of reviews relative to the active users claimed by the company.

Background: New Pacific purchased its mining concessions and was supported by a friendly government. However, this government was overthrown in a coup in 2019, with the president fleeing to Mexico. The new government has accused the previous Minister of Mines of corruption and launched a criminal investigation. The former head of the Bolivian State Mining Corporation (COMIBOL) told Hindenburg “Unless there’s a (comprehensive) framework regulation, I personally don’t think (the New Pacific deal) will get approved by Parliament.”"

853,t3_g8csc6,investing,Crude oil index VS spot prices,"Hi fellow investors,

I came to suprising realisation when I was exploring spot prices of crude oil vs some oil indexes. It seems to me that those indexes fall quicker and rise slower then underlying asset. For example check those 2 charts:

 [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCOMCLTR:IND](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCOMCLTR:IND) 

 [https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) 

from lows in 1/2016 to highs in 6/2018 there is somewhat bigger rise in spot prices of oil in second chart then in that Bloomberg index. In contrast with that from those mentioned highs there is bigger drop in Bloomberg index then in spot price.

I was thinking it may be because index must roll from one contract to another and there can be gains or loses from that. But why in both cases there seem to be loses? For example there is another index which seem to do this even more. Especially on times more then 5 years in the past (which I cant find for Bloomberg index unfortunately)

861,t3_g88lsf,investing,Draftkings (DKNG) dramatically overvalued? Sanity check,"As many of you know, Draftkings went public Friday through a reverse merger with DEAC. When announced last November, the deal was valued at $3.3 billion. In order to hold $400 million cash as required by the terms of the deal, DEAC sold stock which was originally priced at $10 per share. The value of those shares rose to \~$17 by market close yesterday driven by people wanting to invest in Draftkings before the deal was finalized. These DEAC shares are being swapped today 1:1 for DKNG shares.

Problem is, DEAC's S1/A (describing the deal - link below) filed with the SEC yesterday described a large increase in the supply of shares of stock available following the merger. On the 2nd page DEAC is listed as having 44.7 million shares of stock and 3 million warrants. In the ""description of securities"" section on page 150 it says the following:

*After giving effect to the Business Combination, New DraftKings will have approximately 313 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding (assuming no redemptions) and approximately 394 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding (assuming no redemptions).*

For the original deal valuation of $3.3 billion be true, the share price with a 313 million share supply should be \~$10 per share, which is exactly what DEAC offered to pay for shares that did not wish to be converted to shares of DKNG at the shareholder meeting yesterday. Today, DKNG stock opened at over $20 per share which indicates a deal value of over $6 billion. How is this possible when it seems existing shares are being diluted 6-1?

At Charles Schwab (and many other brokerages as well), DKNG shares have not yet been provided to sell. On Friday, the orderbook was incredibly thin, but once new shares hit the market large holders have the liquidity they need to dump at an absurd valuation.

With stocks and bonds, this makes sense.

LONDON—Cargo ports are thinning out as the coronavirus pandemic pummels global trade. Banks and insurance companies say trade could be squeezed even more if a key financial product used to facilitate it isn’t restored to health.

The product is private credit insurance, a kind of guarantee that companies and their banks use when they trade goods. In good times, this little-noticed financial tool reassures both sides in case someone defaults. About €600 billion ($650 billion) of trade-related loans were facilitated this way in 2018."

While local pressures exist and every housing market is different, it is still worth taking a look at broader trends. Where will house prices be a year from now once the coronavirus is behind us and we begin rebuilding our economy?


**The case for lower prices**

*Decreased demand*

Record unemployment and reduced wages will strip demand for purchases. In order to move real estate prices must come down. 

*Increased supply*

After coronavirus restrictions are lifted the banks will be allowed to proceed with business as usual. With record unemployment and a failure of the economy to bounce back as quickly as hoped, foreclosures will be at 2008 levels or worse. 

We may be able to slow the virus but we can't stop it. Many older and people with health issues will lose their lives which will add supply to the market. 


**The case for higher prices**

*Increased money supply*

The Fed is printing money at unprecedented levels. This puts upward price pressure on all assets. Stocks and real estate. 

*Decreased supply*

In the short term, the lockdown is preventing people from leaving their houses. People don't want strangers in their houses and are reluctant from putting their homes on the market. Less supply pushes prices up. 

New home building has ground to a halt which is putting less supply on the market. 


**The case for sideway prices**

Somehow all of these forces will balance and prices will remain stable.

""In 1987 Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pre-tax earnings of $.70 a share; this equates to after-tax earnings of $.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola's earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 10%.

Seeing this, Warren could argue that he had just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that the pretax yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 10% (Coca-Cola's average annual rate of earnings growth for the ten years prior to 1987).

In, in 1987, he had projected out the earnings growth of 10% forward, he could have argued that by 2007 Coca-Cola would have a pretax per share earnings of $4.35 and after-tax earnings of $2.82 a share. This would mean that by 2007 his pretax return on his Coca-Cola equity bonds would grow to 66%, which equates to an after-tax return of 43%.""

893,t3_g7xwhx,investing,FT article: Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‘monster’ depression,"[https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

While the headline is somewhat exaggerated, the premise is correct. 

**Here the whole article:** The divergence between the flying stock market and the dying economy is so extreme it is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.

The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life under global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected, spurring the IMF this week to forecast the biggest global recession since the 1930s' Great Depression.

Some investors are in awe at the scale of the shock. ""We really are in uncharted territory,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""We have a monster mash-up of the Great Depression in size, the crash of 1987 in speed, and 9-11 attack in terms of fear.""

And yet, stock markets have been on a tear for a month. What was once dismissed as a mere ""bear market rally"" often strong but ultimately doomed bounces that can occur in the middle of severe downturns - has now turned into a 23 per cent jump for global stocks. Technically, that qualifies as a new bull market.

The rise has erased half the stock market fall since late February, and brought the FTSE All-World index back to levels seen in the US tax cut-fuelled summer rally of 2017. Analysts and investors say that global efforts by central banks to soothe the financial system have been the trigger.

Citigroup estimates that the biggest central banks will buy $5tn of bonds this year, led by the US Federal Reserve, which is more than twice the size of the stimulus seen at the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The Fed has even charged into areas once thought untouchable for central banks, announcing plans to support corporate debt graded ""junk"" by credit rating agencies.

Throw in various other liquidity injections and a series of government spending packages aimed at ameliorating the effects of measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the overall stimulus bill comes to $14th, according to the IMF.

""The Fed has been very clear that it will do whatever it takes,"" said Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan. ""The question is whether this will be enough.""

Many investors seem to think so. Technology stocks are once again leading the rally, but even travel and leisure stocks have jumped 24 per cent from the lows, trimming their decline this year to 37 per cent.

Investors appear to be writing off 2020, focusing instead on the prospects for an economic normalisation in 2021, analysts say.

Some of the technical forces that fuelled the sell-off are also helping stoke the comeback. Hedging by banks, trading strategies that automatically buy when volatility simmers down, and thinner liquidity are all now supporting the rally, according to JPMorgan.

History also offers some encouragement to the optimists. Bespoke Investment Group crunched the numbers on every big US stock market slump, and found that once equities had clawed back over half their losses, that had tended to signal that the lows would not be retested.

One notable exception, however, was after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. The US stock market rallied over 44 per cent from the November 1929 low through to March 1930 before sliding another 80 per cent, and did not reclaim its 1929 highs until September 1954.

Some investors think this is a plausible scenario now. Paul Singer, the head of Elliott Management, warned that stocks could easily renew their slide and drop by half from the February peak.

""Despite the massive stimulus moves around the world and the unimaginably large new rounds of money printing, there is substantial uncertainty about the future viability of a large range of businesses,"" Mr Singer wrote, in a recent letter to clients. ""To us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains.""

Some nervousness began to creep back into markets this week, triggered by ructions in the oil market crowned by the unprecedented sight of the benchmark US crude price sliding below zero on Monday. Although partly a technical dislocation, it underscored the fragile state of the global economy.

Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season has started to reveal the extent of the revenue destruction hitting many companies. And such grim results may pale next to what is likely to be a

""horrific"" second quarter, warns Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

The message was hammered home by data released on Thursday showing another 4.4m Americans claiming unemployment benefits, taking the total since mid March to over 26m. A potential antiviral drug for coronavirus failed its first randomised clinical trial, further denting sentiment.

Ms Sonders points out that even if equities do not plunge below the lows of March, economic downturns of this magnitude tend to produce a lot of head-fake rallies and stomach-churning sell-offs.

""Anyone who thinks we're going to keep moving up in a straight line is living in la-la land,"" she warned.

\------------

I guess that's what the majority here feels anyways. Doesn't mean you should not be building clever positions at this moment in a few stocks, but these should be true conviction buys based on good entry price, solid company products with longterm growth potential, neat balance sheet and a capable leadership team. Keep 70% to 80% cash."

I think the only reason that would happen is if the virus comes back in the Fall but we’re still multiple months away from that and I can’t see any arguments why there would be another sell off in the next months before that happens as economies start to reopen"
901,t3_g7vock,investing,Betting on industries that have a “monopoly” in the stock market. Taking advantage of dumb money and FOMO.,"I understand there is no such thing as a monopoly in the US but hear me out. 

Last year i saw two companies go public with “decent” valuations that quickly rose to ridiculous market caps once retail investors jumped in. Those companies were the only stock people could buy if they wanted exposure in that industry. I’m talking about Beyond Meat and Virgin Galactic.

Beyond Meat has tons of competition. Impossible burger, Tyson, KHC, whatever, you name it. They will have a very tough time in the next few years.
But they have a “VIRTUAL MONOPOLY” in the stock market, because if people want to invest in “vegan meat” or whatever they make, they are going to buy BYND, because they won’t buy all this other companies that have exposure to fake meat but it’s only a tiny part of their operations. 

This causes “true believers” investors to buy and hold, stock rises FOMO kicks in, people start shorting when ridiculous valuations are reached, big boys know it and push for a short squeeze and you get crazy valuations. BYND from $25 a share IPO to $220 within three months.

The same can be said about Virgin Galatic (SPCE). Yes Boeing has exposure to space, Space X is a thousand miles ahed and the bald guy from amazon has Blue Origin. 

Virgin Galatic was and still is a piece of trash, extremly overvalued company. But if a retail investors wanted exposure to SPACE they could only buy Virgin Galactic. It happened the same with BYND, the stock rose from $7 to $44.

Now i missed those two investment oportunities because i didn’t understand the proces and how can one company with $100M in revenue can be worth 10B.

I don’t want to sit on the sidelines and watch another opportunith go.
Now here is what i think can happen and history repeats itself. Draft Kings went public yesterday  and the investment community was aware of the adquisition company DEAC and how DEAC would be DKNG once the SEC approved lt. 
I believe this company has all the right ingredients to explodd in the coming months and become a stokc like BYND or SPCE.

1. Pure play, if you wanted to invest in online fantasy gambling and sports gambling this company is your only choice.

2. Once loyal users of the platform hear about the stock being public will start pilling ln.

3. Once there is a hint that sports will come back (maybe without audience) this thing will explode.

4. Once CNBC starts talking about a sucessful IPO everybody starts jumping in. 

In conclusion, i tried to inform myself as much i could about the company but coudn’t find any financials or 10K. Only found an investors presentation and how much revenue and users they have. I’m not sure i want to jump in this early but i’m afraid this is going tl be some SPCE/BYND hype train stock and i’m going to lose on amazing returns. Any thoughts?"
902,t3_g7va1y,investing,Boeing pulls out of $4.2 Billion Deal with Embraer,"Looks like [this decision was recently announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-embraer-m-a-boeing/boeing-pulls-out-of-4-2-billion-deal-for-embraers-commercial-jet-unit-idUSKCN2270KN).

&gt;SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Saturday said it had canceled a $4.2 billion deal to buy the commercial jets division of Embraer (EMBR3.SA), unraveling years of work on what the Brazilian planemaker expected to be a transformative move.

Does this reflect a strategic effort that will give shareholders optimism about Boeing's financial security, or does it suggest a ""bad news to come"" scenario?

$BA shares hit a low of $128.39 yesterday, after they announced production cuts and pushback of timeline to bring back the MAX fixes.

**Edits:** 

I wonder how much of this is to free up money to pay debt that is going to be [due in 2020](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4339778-boeing-737-max-bailout)?

&gt;**Boeing short-term debt and interest payments**  
&gt;  
&gt;The next portion is Boeing's borrowings, and that is obviously what brought the company in problems with another crisis hitting many industries; Boeing borrowed $25.4B in 2019 and fully used its $13.8B credit facility. From the $25.4B, $12.2B was used to make debt repayment. Boeing's current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt is $7.3B. While many companies are now tapping into their credit lines, Boeing already did that last year, which, by no means, is a positive indication. I also modeled in Boeing tapping its $9.6B revolving credit facility, of which $3.2B is due by the end of October 2020, though Boeing does have the ability to extend the termination times by a year.  
&gt;  
&gt;I estimated that Boeing would pay around $800-950 million in interest on their debt at the end of 2019 and a hefty $1B fee on their $13.8B delayed drawdown arrangement as well as a significant fee on the credit line agreements.

***Further, some speculation that Embraer say's this agreement was wrongfully terminated:***

&gt;[Embraer believes strongly t](https://leehamnews.com/2020/04/25/embraer-boeing-wrongfully-terminated-jv-will-seek-remedies/)hat Boeing has wrongfully terminated the MTA, that it has manufactured false claims as a pretext to seek to avoid its commitments to close the transaction and pay Embraer the US$4.2 billion purchase price. We believe Boeing has engaged in a systematic pattern of delay and repeated violations of the MTA, because of its unwillingness to complete the transaction in light of its own financial condition and 737 MAX and other business and reputational problems.

&gt;Embraer believes strongly that Boeing has wrongfully terminated the (agreement), that it has manufactured false claims as a pretext to seek to avoid its commitments to close the transaction and pay Embraer the US$4.2 billion purchase price,” Embraer said. “We believe Boeing has engaged in a systematic pattern of delay and repeated violations of the (agreement) because of its unwillingness to complete the transaction in light of its own financial condition and 737 MAX and other business and reputational problems.”

Recent press conference this was specifically mentioned for scale. I think Microsoft is planning a Machine Learning Store for commercial purposes working like the App Store for pre-made models.**

Also I work in the Data Science Field.

——————————————————————

As some of you may or may not know, Power BI has the ability to add pre-made machine learning and deep learning models internally

Once I learned about this I knew where Microsoft was headed

I’m thinking machine learning and AI will be a sort of addition to power bi users completely nulling the need for learning code, why?

Microsoft’s job is to make it as easy as possible for everyone to use their systems and this is why I think Microsoft will have a similar variation of the “App Store” for machine learning models and algorithms

Actual engineers will have the unique experience to be sort of like an app developer where they develop their code and publish it in the App Store and people using Power BI will be able to either download it for free or for a small fee

In their recent press conference about Power BI they mentioned pre-made models being directly implemented into the power BI software and said that this was done specifically for scale

In my opinion, I really think this is the direction Microsoft is headed with their Power BI software and their implementation of scale through Machine Learning for everybody

RGAGX has consistently beaten AALTX for returns in almost every year, yet the Lipper rating system rates AALTX much higher than RGAGX. RGAGX has also beaten the S&amp;P average almost every year, but AALTX has not. 

However - according to the Lipper Average ratings systems, RGAGX is bottom of the barrel while AALTX is in the top 1% of performing funds. Am I misinterpreting this rating system?

909,t3_g7trzq,investing,How will the economy fundamentally change because of COVID-19,"I posted this as a comment but thought it would make a good post of its own. The people who keep bleating ""pRiCeD iN!!!11!"" I think are failing to recognize that the economy is undergoing profound changes, and we are only beginning to have the vaguest sense of what the implications are of those changes are.

I listed out a few industries below that I think will be permanently and negatively affected because of COVID-19:

* Commercial real estate - totally fucked. Many white collar businesses have just had to make massive investments to get their employees to be able to work from home, I know my company has (goodbye bonus). You think they will just force everyone to return to the office in two months when things start to open back up? You think they won't realize how much money they can save on rent by just making everyone work from home permanently (essentially making employees shoulder their rent costs)? You think employees will want to return to the office when they have gotten comfortable working from home, not having to commute and hour and not having to pay exorbitant amounts for child care? GTFO

* Tourism - the days easy international travel are over. No more quick getaways to Europe on Ryan Air for $99 or whatever. It's going to be a long time before countries start letting in tourists and other non-citizens like they used to, given that the Cornonavirus outbreak in Italy may be been started by [two superspreader Chinese tourists](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/italy-links-coronavirus-outbreak-to-chinese-tourists-p8002005p), although granted they are now thinking it was in the country earlier. But point is that international travel will be extremely difficult if not impossible for the foreseeable future.

* Oil &amp; Gas - less commuting (see commercial real estate above) = less need for gas = less need for oil.

* Cruise lines - need I say more?

* Malls/retail - no one is going to risk their life to go shopping when they can just order from home, COVID-19 is just accelerating the death of brick-and-mortar retail.

* Restaurants - You spend less money taking out food than actually dining in at a restaurant. Similar to malls/retail, no one is going to risk their life just for the privilege of paying to sit down at a restaurant where the waiter is wearing a mask and [you will have to use disposable menus and plastic knives and forks](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-restaurants-changes-5717e86b-e9a4-4cb6-9963-85411e910107.html)

These are just a few examples, would love to see what others think, I'm sure I'm missing a ton."
910,t3_g7tr4i,investing,Half joking: long INTU because of USO?,"There are now nearly 200,000 Robinhood accounts holding USO, not to mention all the other holdings of various oil products that are structured as partnerships (like DBO, UCO, USL and others.) That's at least nearly 200,000 people that will get a K-1 form (when you invest in a partnership you get a K-1) next year (K-1 printer go brrrr) and you have to pay for an upgraded Turbotax to enter that information.

When has there ever been this much retail interest/piling into products structured as partnerships? I can't recall. Additionally, while USO is having a reverse split, there was a massive amount of additional shares created recently: **""So, after an incredible orgy of share creation that increased USO’s shares outstanding to 1.449 billion yesterday from 156 million at the end of February.""** (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/04/22/a-plummeting-share-price-and-upcoming-reverse-split-show-that-uso-has-outlived-its-usefulness)

That's a lot of shares that retail investors were buying and how many accounts at RH or elsewhere were buying 10, 20, 30 shares? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/robinhood-traders-kept-flooding-into-biggest-oil-etf-during-rout. Earlier this week: ""On SoFi Invest — another trading platform used mostly by traders under 40 — USO was “by far” the highest-volume security on Tuesday and Wednesday."" https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/23/short-sellers-make-nearly-300-million-betting-against-retail-investors-favorite-oil-fund.html

So you have a massively increased share count, tremendous retail interest that is likely widely spread out among a significant retail base that we know includes at least nearly 200,000 users on RH (and that's just Robinhood - with that many shares and that much buying interest, how many accounts are now long an oil partnership fund - 750,000? 1M?) - all of whom will be getting a K-1 form, no matter how long they held.

Will some people go to an accountant? Sure. But a lot of people will use Turbotax and find that they have to upgrade next year. So, next year INTU will get at least a decent amount of added business because of all this USO ridiculousness.

I mean, this is sort of r/wsb-ish DD and part ""thinking out loud"" amusement, but there's perhaps something to it. 

TLDR: I think that INTU will next year be one thing that actually benefits from this USO ridiculousness."

A lot of companies are expected to or have already cut their dividends entirely this year because of the disastrous global shutdowns and ongoing demand destruction completely killing revenue, profits and cash flows. This completely flies in the face of conventional passive buy and hold wisdom which assumes that ""companies always pay dividends"" even during recessions so everything is fine. If anyone has simulated backtests with historical data, this tends to minimise portfolio downturns provided that you [reinvest the dividends](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/).

My biggest fear is that that the market won't recover for at least 5 - 10 years if we really are headed towards a depression and countries worldwide completely rethink Globalisation and trade with China. This is probably the worst case scenario, so we'll probably have something somewhere in the middle. But unless people here can really stomach a further 50 - 90% decline over the next couple of months or years with little to no dividend, I'm strongly considering to pull out for the sole purpose of buying the bottom later."

917,t3_g7pk7n,investing,Stay defensive,"Yo, I came across a very interesting read: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1813987?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents 

It talks about interest rates during the Civil War and WW1. To summarize, the market rate of interest should generally follow the below formula:

Interest Rates = Pure Interest + Risk Premia + Frictions

Where pure interest is the risk-free rate (set by time preferences) and the risk premia consists of: risk of default, currency devaluation (relevant if $ pegged to gold), risk of high inflation etc. During war periods, you would expect all three factors to rise.

During the Civil War interest rates generally did increase. However, during WW1, the U.S. increased the money supply so voluminously that interest rates stayed level until 1917. The takeaway is that monetary policy is far more powerful than the supply / demand actions of the population.

The kicker -- the U.S. entered two sharp recessions following WW1 as reserve requirements stretched thin needed to be scaled back and the money supply curtailed as to maintain convertibility to gold. 

We have a similar situation in COVID world. The fed has set reserve requirements to 0 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm Also, the fed is dumping dollars into the market ($40B daily), buying securitized corp debt (unprecedented) and even non-IG debt! We are witnessing a 1-m rally in the equity markets during 20% unemployment. 

What will happen when this ends? Will this even need to end? Clearly it will need to end to some degree. Reserve requirements cannot stay at 0%. But does the Fed's balance sheet need to shrink? The answer is unclear. But, we do not need to maintain convertibility to gold unlike post-WW1. Also, during WW1, the economy faced immense inflation (+10%) which is not a factor here. 

I am not advocating for a complete shift to cash. The market and the fed's balance sheet can stay elevated far longer than what you think is possible. I am however advocating for caution and an awareness that asset prices could collapse anytime. Buy nothing that you wouldn't hold for 1 economic cycle."
918,t3_g7pixx,investing,Why USO is trading at a premium?,"Why USO is trading at a premium? Does it mean it will come down soon.

Edit: Here's my thought in more detail:

Now USO is trading at a 6% premium.

If SEC approves new creation baskets, bang! premium drop to 0. If oil price stay the same as now, that's a 6% instant drop guaranteed. Everyone holding USO should be selling now to avoid getting further crashed. But this is not happening. Why?

The only possible reason I can think of:

1. Short recover.
2. Dumb money coming in. (Everyone should be scared by now, right?)
3. SEC won't approve new creation baskets soon, by the time it approves, oil price will go up at least 6% to offset the premium.

If it is case 3, won't the best play be short USO and long the underlining future contract, and pocket that 6% profit, typical arbitrage.

If it is case 1, still the best play is not to recover the shorts now, but buying the underlining assets. (Well, maybe they are already doing it, and that's why the oil price went up a bit these few days, but why the gap is not closed yet?)

So it must be case 2, those dumb money see oil going up and dump in USO without think whether it is traded at premium or discount. The best play here is to short USO, and hedge with futures, right?

tldr, there's a market inefficiency here, and I don't understand why it hasn't been rectified yet. Why not Short USO, long CLN20 &amp; CLQ20? 

If I can see it, everyone else can see it, certainly the big guys. Then why it is not done yet, there must be a catch that I missed, what is it?"

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&amp;P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling. Another analysis worth doing might consider selling companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

Here are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, that number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) lost to the SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

I have the individual stocks/annual lots broken down on a Google Spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dev1SaLhTjS7q_uuhdTwzTifi7ko24QdRCxx4jze7Ps/edit?usp=sharing)."
932,t3_g7ly72,investing,Corporate buybacks and stock returns,"When all this is done, I see regulations guarding corporate buybacks to become commonplace due to companies not having enough liquidity. There are also ethical issues of companies not putting the cash into their employees pockets or putting more in R&amp;D. 

Since the truth about the 09 to 2019 bull market is that it was heavily fueled by corporate buybacks, will that mean that stocks will not return the same amount going forward? How much of the bull market was really just a farce to benefit the managers and artificially improve EPS? 

A more disturbing question is has the US Stock market peaked? Will we go down and trade largely sideways for the coming decades just like much of the world has already done?"

934,t3_g7lk1q,investing,Getting Filled for Options,"I am at a heartfelt blockade that is utterly annoying. I have not done all the research because that would consume weeks/months of trading days with transferring funds from broker to broker but I am wondering if anyone here knows of or has a broker that fills orders quickly for options trading. I currently use Robinhood. There are many problems I have with the platform though. Market makers on Robinhood undercut option buyers/sellers horribly. I can place an order for a vertical spread at $0.42 of credit per spread, then seconds after placing the order the new distance between the strikes only credits about $0.27 a spread. The price of the desired options fluctuate until the user gives into the undercut credit of the spread simply to execute their order. And this has happened to me countless times. I understand the credit is associated with the price difference of options on the option chain, but the fluctuation mainly occurs only when I place a desirable spread, and once I cancel my order the option pricing seems to stable out but at cheaper pricing. This also happens when I want to buy positions for options. I made the costly mistake this morning of purchasing a $ZM put without entering a limit price, meaning robinhood only gave me market value of the option, and immediately after my order was filled prior to the underlying stock even moving 20 cents I was already down $120. This frustration has reached a point to where I come on reddit to ask fellow options traders if they have a broker they are truly happy with. I have heard ToS (thinkorswim) has similar issues filling orders, and I have yet to experiment with TastyWorks (same creators of ToS) because he made the same platform that many users have the same complaints I have. I have heard but not done much research on Webull, E-Trade, or any major broker that has options level 3 available. Is there anyone that can give any advice on what to try next? I just need a broker I can get orders filled quickly on."

936,t3_g7kpyj,investing,Real Estate vs. Dividend Growth Investing,"I'm fairly young and new to investing with not much money in the market but I've been researching different forms of investing and I have an interest in both real estate and stocks. 

What attracts me is a passive income every month whether it be from dividends from stocks or rent from rental properties. 

I'm from Toronto so let's say the average home price is 800k and the average rent for 2020 is around 2k for a 4bdrm house. Having that 800k house as my rental property would provide me with (2000x12)/800k = 3% return annually. I know house prices/rent could be different in certain areas but I am using this as an example.

With 3% return on such a large investment and not even including all the other fees/bills you have to pay for owning the house in the first place, why would people not look at investing that money into stocks where you can get a decent yield on your investment in companies that pay safe dividends. Or even into REITs that pay an even more generous dividend yield. 

One argument could be owning the house in the future and having that large asset to your name, but stocks could also increase in value with dividends reinvested and compounded. 

Just some thoughts a 20 year old student with minimal investing knowledge has. Feel free to correct me for anything I may have misunderstood. Thanks!"

947,t3_g7i40k,investing,Hedging Portfolio with TED Spread,"Hi all.

Just wondering if it is possible to hedge stock market exposure by holding a short Eurodollar position and long 2 year treasury position. I know TED spread is technically 3 month vs. 3 month though. My idea is that credit risk rises during a crash so TED spread widens, and the Eurodollars hedge interest rate risk of a purely long treasury position. Also ignore the fact that TED spread is pretty high right now - I'm looking at implementing this later on.

I have the following questions since I am inexperienced with interest rate futures:

1. What ratio of GE:ZT should I be holding? I know GE face value is $1m vs. ZT of $200k but how does DV01 come into things?
2. How much leverage should I generally be using to sufficiently hedge market exposure? e.g. turn 1 -&gt; 0-0.5 market correlation
3. Does shorting GE implicitly go long 3 month T bill since you are lending/borrowing at the risk free rate?
4. Any other things I should be considering?"

Started to glance at DraftKing’s S-1 today and I am having a tough time understanding the ownership breakdown post-business combination between DEAC and SBTech. I get that DEAC is essentially = ~40mm shares converted 1:1 with DKNG class A but in addition the section adds:

“186,831,051 shares of New DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the DK Equityholders applying a 0.3546 exchange ratio, and 393,954,594 shares of New DraftKings Class B common stock are issued to Jason Robins, 40,861,997 DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the SBT Sellers, applying a 1,001.5 exchange ratio there will be an aggregate of 313,077,942 shares of New DraftKings Class A”

Bloomberg shows 313mm as the equity float with a $6bn market cap, is that correct? It seems like there is a ton of dilution not being accounted for based on the current share price. From the articles I’ve read about the merger announced in December, initial valuations were at $3.3bn, so not fully understanding the huge increase.

**Scenario A:** 100% in VTI (total market index fund)

Total return: 28%

Annual return: 5.6%

**Scenario B:** 100% in SPY (S&amp;P 500 index fund)

Today's amount: $40,116 (+$10,116)

Total return: 33.7%

Annual return: 6.74%

**Scenario C:** 1/3rd in each of GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, the three largest companies in 2015

* GOOGL $10,000 -&gt; $23,009 (130% up)

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns.

NOTE: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

NOTE #2: All three of these companies were near 10-year highs five years ago, for those who are trying to time the market and waiting for a drop."
