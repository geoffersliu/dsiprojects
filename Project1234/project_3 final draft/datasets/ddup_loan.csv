0,t3_9w474g,StudentLoans,How to Identify a Student Loan Scam,"It seems it's time to sticky another post about this based on recent sub activity.

**Here's the most important bit - you should never have to pay for help with your student loans.  There isn't a person or entity on the planet that can get you a better deal, or access to a benefit or program, that you can't get yourself, for free, by working directly through your loan holder.**

The second most important bit is the old school - if it sounds too good to be true, it almost assuredly is.

While it's not illegal to charge for student loan help, many of the companies that do also engage in what is absolutely fraudulent and deceptive behaviour.  If you experience any of the following, we here at /r/studentloans encourage you to report it to your local attorney general's office and the Federal Trade Commission as well as the Department of Education.  All of these entities are actively pursuing and taking enforcement actions against these companies.

Warning signs/things to report:

Company claims to ""work with"" or partner with the Department of Education on any of the student loan servicers

Claims you can receive forgiveness, especially before knowing anything about your student loan balance and loan type

Mentions ""the Obama forgiveness program"" - there's no such thing

Creates a sense of urgency for you to sign up right away

Asks for a power of attorney over your loan accounts

Asks for any of your FSA or other passwords or PINS (never give those - to anyone)

Many of these companies ask for a large up front enrollment fee - anywhere from six hundred to twelve hundred dollars and then a monthly fee of around 39 bucks.  They often infer that the monthly fee is actually your student loan payment.  For these fees they will consolidate your loans - which you can do easily - for free - at www.studentloans.gov and often put the loans in forbearance - so no payment is due but interest is still accruing - and take you thirty nine dollars every month to ""monitor"" the account - i.e. do nothing.

I have personally worked with a borrower who had been in repayment for fifteen years when she was snagged by one of these companies.  They had her sign a POA and used it to change all the contact info on the account to their own address and phone number.  She paid a few thousand up front and the typical thirty nine bucks monthly - she thought that was her payment.  After three years she gets a call from the feds - her loan was in default and double what it was when she started.  They'd put it in forbearance until they couldn't anymore - then just let it go delinquent and default and disappeared with her money.  The feds only found her through skip tracing.  And there was nothing anyone could do for her

1,t3_ghp77u,StudentLoans,Update on credit bureau reporting for COVID waivers - also some new info on IDR recertification,"Hi there.  This weekend many of you reported that your credit bureau reports showed your status as deferred or in forbearance for loans that are eligible for the covid waivers.  Some of you also showed a credit score drop because of it.  As you may know, the CARES Act requires that these waivers be reported as if you were on time and making payments.

I've spoken to several folks in the industry and am told that the issue is one of system programming.  Up until now, there were no forbearances or deferments that should be reported as anything other than a forbearance or deferment.  The servicing systems had to be reprogrammed to report these waivers as in repayment and receiving payments even though they are actually in a forbearance.  That took time.  The servicers must report to the credit bureaus on the 10th of each month.  While they were able to get the waivers placed on the accounts by then, some were not able to complete the additional programming needed to correctly report the status by the April 10th reporting date.  Hence the deferred status on the credit reports.

I am told that for most if not all - i believe all - of the servicers, this programming was completed in time for the May 10th (really today since the 10th was a sunday) reporting so all the accounts should be updated in the next few weeks.  I suggest checking your credit reports in a week and if not updated in another two weeks.  If not updated in a month let me know.

As far as IDR certification goes - they have been pushed out by six months.  You can still recertify on your anniversary date even if it falls during the waivers - but if you don't want to you can wait.  Just keep an eye on any correspondence you receive to make sure you aren't waiting too long and end up with capitalized interest.

EDIT:  If there's anyone living in Georgia that is willing to be on camera (from your home via zoom) with an Atlanta news station - and that was negatively affected by this credit bureau issue - please let me know and I'll connect you with the station."
2,t3_ghxdmi,StudentLoans,"""Average"" Person Paying Loans? Not a doctor/lawyer/engineer","Hey! Long-time lurker...

 Not sure if this is the right place to post but I see a lot of people posting about their debt journey and how they paid it off. However, they usually have a high paying job (&gt;80k), have a partner that helps support them, live with their parents, etc. Is there any interest in people reading content from a normal person like me that doesn't make &gt;80k (not even close) but is still making progress on loans?

I feel like this content would help inspire others who aren't doctors/lawyers/engineers. We are just ""normal"" people that either made a mistake taking out loans or wanted an education and thought this was the best way to fund it. It can be discouraging reading other peoples debt journeys when they have a ""leg up"" so to speak salary wise. For example, I can't live with my parents. Not an option for me.

If this is of interest to others, I will post my blog (not started yet), but I feel like I can't be the only normal person that is able to pay off debt and still somehow get by. And I think one has to decide if they want to pay it off quickly or enjoy their life during. Not a plug, just wondering if people even care about this content. If not, I won't waste my time.

Thanks Reddit!"
3,t3_gi5zt3,StudentLoans,Why would my student loan payment go down?,"So every month, I pay roughly about 100/month which has been like this for several months (I make all my monthly payments), and this month, it went down to 90. Any reason as to why this would happen, or would it be the interest rate?"
4,t3_ghz2d7,StudentLoans,"Conflicting advice for mountain of debt (high salary, frugal lifestyle)","Hello all! I'm extremely happy with my career, but it's landed me with quite a bit of student debt.  

The only debt I have is my student loans (All direct federal loans) and ooh boy get prepared for some sticker shock:  
Total debt: $595,569.81  
I am currently enrolled in REPAYE and making no payments because I had $0 income on my 2018 tax return. Please understand my reasoning for choosing this method of payment.  
Here are my payoff choices as I see it:  
1. income based repayment at about $1500 per month with 25 year loan forgiveness/corresponding tax bill of $300,000 ish = $750,000 paid over 25 years  
2. refinance loans and pay off in 10 years- assuming 4% refinancing, the bill would be about $6,060 per month, which is my entire take-home pay, so this is not currently a feasible option = $727,200 total paid over 10 years  
3. change career tracks entirely, go into Public Service Loan Forgiveness job for 10 years, pay income based repayment about $1,500 per month, balance is forgiven after 10 years tax-free on qualifying loans = $180,000 paid over 10 years. 

PSLF seems like an obvious choice, but I'm not so sure. The current president has talked about ending the PSLF program, which really makes me nervous. Also, while public service is certainly worthwhile, it's not how I want to go for professional reasons. Additionally these jobs are highly competitive and even if I find one, it might require me to uproot and move somewhere else entirely. I'm also really happy in my current job/area, and I have lots of room to improve myself and my situation. My salary has the potential to double or even triple with bonuses. So, my current choice is to go with option 1) 25 year loan forgiveness with ridiculous tax bill. 

Recently a mentor recommended refinancing to a 30-year term in order to free up cash flow, and pay off aggressively with any extra money. **Wouldn't this cost me more in the long run**? 

It's important to me to reach financial independence. I max out my 401k (15% of gross income) and put more than 50% of my take home pay into savings. Recently I just started to invest in index funds as a tactic to save up for the tax bill on my loan forgiveness. 

Thank you for your input!"
5,t3_gi361j,StudentLoans,"Refinancing, surviving, etc.","Hi everyone!

I just graduated LITERALLY yesterday, and I’m already trying to get ahead in terms of managing my debt. I have $154k in debt from my undergrad (yikes, I know). About $120k is private from Discover with interest ranging from 6-8%, and the remainder is federal. 

I’ll be working as a nurse, so I know my income will be okay. My only other expenses as of right now is my car payment and insurance which is about $350/month, as I’m lucky enough to still live with my parents. Obviously, my loans aren’t going to be due until December, but I want to be ahead of the game instead of getting surprised with an outrageous monthly payment. I have okay credit. Credit karma said I have a 753, but when I had my credit pulled for an auto loan, it showed up as a 683.

Would I be able to refinance before they’re due in December? Or, would I be better refinancing around then? Basically, asking when the best time to refinance is. 

Also, has anyone refinanced similar amounts? What companies did you use &amp; how was your experience?
I’d also appreciate any possible tips on managing this insane amount of debt. 

Thanks!"

7,t3_gi8qkd,StudentLoans,PSLF and Forbearance Question - Trying to Understand my Options,"I recently started a job with the federal government which I'm hoping will make me eligible for PSLF and my loans can be forgiven after 10 years. 


I was originally planning on opting out of the forbearance for the Cares Act as I'm still working but I've been reading into it more and people have said not to make extra payments if you are planning on having the loans forgiven. Instead put that money into an emergency fund or the like. 


Regardless of whether I'm able to enter into the PSLF my loans are on the REPAYE plan so they would be (hopefully) forgiven in 20-25 years. I'm only 4 years into my payments.


I'm looking for advice- should I opt out of the forbearance? Should I just make extra payments towards the high interest loans? (I have multiple loans under my servicer with varying interest rates, both subsidized and unsubsidized and all are federal) or should I put that money elsewhere and just continue making payments when the forbearance period is over?"

&amp;#x200B;

I will be going back to school in the fall. Going in as a freshman at 24 (Got my first degree from a community college in Unmanned Aircraft with no loans). I moved to another state for work, so, unfortunately, I won't qualify for instate until the summer of 2021(I have every intention of staying in this state to live and work, and can prove so). I have filled out the FAFSA and maxed out my federal grants and student loans. I have emergency savings, however long story short what I had in my regular savings was used for medical bills due to a not-at-fault car accident last year. I should be able to get that money back whenever the suit completes, which could be another 12 months at this point as its being dragged out. 

I am unable to both pay for school and my living expenses working part-time while in Out of State classification due to cost.  I have already set up everything to get into the engineering program, and my spot would not necessarily be held if I took a gap year, so that is something id like to avoid. My credit is not the best right now, and currently only got approved with Sallie Mae at 9% for 20,000. The rest of the semesters, ill be able to pay out of pocket. 

My question is, do you think that taking the loan out for 9% to get me through this school year is worth it? Any other ideas on other places I should try applying?  Also, would it be easy to refinance in 1-2 years when my credit is better? (I've been slowly increasing it over the last 6 months and it is a priority in my life)

17,t3_ghtu65,StudentLoans,Student loan refinancing - when is the best time for me?,"i am a current medicine resident about to graduate in 2 months. The numbers I'm looking at are:

1. Starting salary will go from $60k --&gt; $350k.

2. I have about $185k in federal student loans with an average interest rate of 6% and around $42k in unpaid, uncapitalized interest for a total loan balance of $227k. I have been on PAYE throughout residency and just recertified in March 2020.

3. My budget will allow me to pay about $10k/month toward my loans (I will make a lump sum payment at the end of the current interest free period). Because of this, if I stay on PAYE there shouldn't be any interest capitalization that occurs for my next recertification when I no longer meet the ""financial hardship"" definition.

4. If I were to refinance, as a conservative estimate I could probably get the interest down to 4%, but if I do this before paying off the outstanding interest then it will capitalize and become part of my principle.

I've been trying to wrap my head around the math and I'm just having a hard time figuring it out. My question is when should I plan to refinance my loans down to a lower rate? The lump sum payment I make at the end of the current interest free period will bring my unpaid uncapitalized interest down to $12k.

Should I just keep the 6% interest rate for another 1.5 months to pay off the interest and then refinance, or take the lower rate starting in October and have the interest capitalize?"

I never made any payments on any loans because I never attended the school, for one, and for two we told the financial advisor we would only be able to attend if we could cover it through grants, to which she agreed the Pell/Cal grant would cover the majority of tuition cost and no loans were needed.

Collection calls say otherwise, say I have a couple loans I need to be paying back. Tried to get them to send out proof that I signed something loan related but it still has not arrived in the mail. When loan payments start back up again I'd like to have this taken care of cause its wrecking my credit score and any chance of using financial aid to attend a community college.

Alright, so let me get a few things straight:

* I **did not** choose to defer my payments -- My autopay was automatically suspended until November 2020, due to the CARES Act, an action explicitly taken by the servicer on ""my behalf""
* Per the CARES Act, any loan that is current (mine was) at time of ""relief"" (again, relief that I did not seek) is required to be reported as current through the end of relief, per [this explanation by Experian](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-the-cares-act-affects-credit-reports-and-scores/)
* This is now theoretically a statement that will ding me on a monthly basis through November, causing my score to drop significantly, as well as remain on my report for the **next 7 years**

How can I be negatively impacted by an action that **I didn't even opt to take**? An action that was **automatically taken by the loan servicer?**

I have been working extensively to up my credit since mid-last year and am nothing short of infuriated right now.

What would be the best course of action here? Contact the credit bureaus and dispute? I can't be the only one that's going to be hurt by this -- These are federal loans, which suggests many, many of us are about to experience similar impact, which will be very damaging in the long term."

41,t3_gh96t3,StudentLoans,Is refinancing a better option than REPAYE after graduation?,"I'm a graduating med student with 200k+ in federal loan. Most of my classmates are going to do REPAYE instead of standard payment during residency, because they won't be able to afford the standard monthly payment on our low salary. They also prefer REPAYE over refinancing even for those not planning for loan forgiveness because under REPAYE, the government subsides half of your interest. However, I'm thinking refinancing is a better option because private loans don't capitalize until after residency whereas under REPAYE, the interest capitalizes daily- so there's interest on interest. I'm now starting to think even if a private refinanced loan interest is slightly higher than the subsidized REPAYE interest, it might still be a good idea to refinance right after graduation? Also under REPAYE, any additional payment you make won't go towards the principle and will go towards the interest that the government is subsidizing anyway- so you're literally throwing money away. Please someone provide me some guidance."

I start grad school shorty and am in a position where I will be accepting:

* $20,500 (full amount) of a Stafford unsubisidzed loan 
* $ 9,500 of a Grad PLUS loan 

I’m using this to only cover indirect expenses. For my two year program, that will work out to $60,000 total. (So the above list is what I’ll need per year)

Here’s where I’m at a bit of a loss: I don’t understand how to calculate what I’ll be charged each month for a minimum payment, what to pay per month while I’m in school in addition to that, or who to contact about figuring that out. 

I’ve calculated 60k because that will give me a little wiggle room for unexpected expenses. I also want to avoid any incident where I’m missing the minimum payment. 

Is it up to me about how much I can pay off each month in addition to the minimum? If I have money left over from the loan itself to pay back the loan interest, does that mean I’m taking out too much? 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm currently waiting on a decision for my Borrowers Defense app, but it's been a couple years, and my expectations are not high.

My question,  however, is why is it when I check Credit Karma every week do the amounts owed go up or down by hundreds and thousands?

Last week my credit score dropped a few points and the only changes were that each loan went up by $20 or $30; however, this morning my credit score went up by 67 points, the only change being that my loans reported decreased of $716  and $400 respectively.

I want to be debt free but also want to put money into retirement.

So with those accounts it makes it a lot harder to spend money.

50,t3_ggpraf,StudentLoans,My fiance's afraid to apply for FAFSA due to her previous college years GPA,"My fiance had attended KU for four years a few years ago. In her last year there she battled with depression and loneliness; this made her grades and overall GPA suffer. She ended up leaving KU without graduating.

Now that she's ready to go back to school and finish her degree she's afraid to apply for Financial Aid because of something someone she works with told her.

This co-worker of hers told her that if she were to apply for FAFSA to attend this new school that they would have to pull her old GPA/transcript from KU and that would affect her GPA at this new school; possibly even making them not accept her. 

I have never heard anything like this, and I wonder if it's even true. But because she believes it to be true she's trying to get me to apply for loans for her to be able to pay for college. I don't mind this as I want her to succeed and would do anything for her, but I need to know if this is a real thing or if she's been told a lie.

Can anyone answer this? And thank you in advance for the help. This whole thing has been a central force for some recent arguments and stress.

But if you do medical school you typically have to take out 200k in loans and have a rate of 4-8%

I have been contemplating getting a personal loan from Navy Federal (which has a low interest) and give myself some more time and security when repaying these loans. Please look up Navy Federal.

57,t3_gh2zh3,StudentLoans,Advice for what to repay off,"Hi everyone, 18M college student here

I currently have about 10k loans in my name (the rest are in my parents' name) and this number will go up an extra ~7k, since I have another year of school left. I was able to pay off about ~4k last summer but I still have ways to go.

Since I couldn't be in the dorms for the rest of the semester this year due to COVID-19,  I was refunded about ~3k.

My question is, since there are no interest rates currently, should I use the 3k to pay off more of my principal 10k debt?

The other thing I was thinking of doing is, in the fall, I'll probably have an apartment that costs ~700 a month and so I was thinking of saving up for that. 

Any other advice on what to do with the 3k?"
58,t3_ggonln,StudentLoans,Took out a loan from Sallie Mae that I can't pay back and I'm contemplating suicide as the only way out,"This post isn't a rant, or a diss on Sallie Mae. I'm also not trying to get sympathy from anyone on this sub. I'll try to be as brief as possible.

I was an international student in the U.S., I took out a loan to pay for my studies, with the help from a co-signer. Finished college, got my degree, got a few jobs that didn't pay much, then had to come back to my home country because my student visa had expired.

The amount due I have to pay to Sallie May for the loan repayment is set between $400 - $500 (the total balance is around $30K). My family has been helping me make the payments, however, it can't go on for much longer. Our financial situation is deteriorating, and coming up with that amount on a monthly basis is near impossible.

I've spoken to Sallie Mae on several occasions about this. They've told me these are my options:

Forbearance - Of which I only get 12 months, and I've used 9 of those already.

Refinance - A procedure for which I'll need my co-signer to cooperate and give over financial information to Sallie Mae, something they're not willing to do.

That's pretty much it. Other than that, if the amount isn't paid in full each month, it will affect the credit of my co-signer radically, and there might be debt collectors involved, and I can't let that happen (my co-signer is a relative living in the U.S.).

There are documents from Sallie Mae that state that if the loan borrower passes away, under any circumstance, the loan is forgiven and the debt is cancelled.

This is basically the only option I have available where neither my co-signer or my family is affected financially. I've spoken directly to Sallie Mae about this and they've confirmed that, once the death certificate is produced, the loan is forgiven.

It's a tricky situation but given the circumstances I sincerely don't see any other way out. I've been living under stress, struggling to come up with this amount on a monthly basis, for the better part of the past couple of years. I'm just exhausted.

I'm not sure what I expect by posting this here. Certainly not a solution, nor validation. I guess I just needed to take this off my chest."

My law school scholarship covers most of the tuition... but it leaves around $2500 per semester that I have to come up with myself

Along with that $2500 I’m going to need to pay for first semester books.... I just feel like perhaps taking out a loan for this amount isn’t a good idea. I’ll probably need $5k-$7k in total to avoid taking out a loan (my living expenses are already saved)

My mother says I should take out a full $20,500, but she has almost $300,000 in debt from loans. 

She’s a veteran and also says she’s never paying them and has managed to find all sorts of loopholes and hasn’t paid on her loans for around a decade 

I don’t think I’ll be so lucky and I can’t entirely rely on her judgment here. My total loan amount would be around $55,000 if I take the loan... but what if I don’t get into a high paying position? That’s around $595 a month that I still have to pay (if I pay them off in 10 years; depending on interest rates). 

I would only take the one loan for the entirety of law school, I wouldn’t need it for the next two years.

I followed my dream of doing what I wanted to as far as happiness, but it's a career with a major ceiling for moving up the income ladder.

I don’t have a lot of money to be making extra payments right now, but.. I keep hearing that w/interest frozen right now it’s good to make any extra payments you can. The subsidized loans only have like $3 in interest on them currently, unsubsidized show to have capitalized interest ranging from $150-$350 on 4 of the groups. I’ve just been paying by account for 1.5 years because I didn’t quite understand (prob still don’t). 

So, if I made a payment right now, 1. would I pay by group and ONLY target the unsubsidized groups since these are generally worse? Or pay the ones with the highest interest rate? Although the interest rates really aren’t much different (3.7-4.6%) so idk if it would matter. **I guess I’m wondering if I can pay off any old interest that was capitalizing before interest starts accruing again.. so it’s not interest on interest.. if that even makes sense.. I’m a first gen college student so trying to figure all of this out. If it matters, I’m starting grad school in August and will be in deferment again, so the interest on the unsubsidized loans will just start capitalizing while I’m in school again (I think).. so in my mind what’s the point of paying it now just for it to go back up? 

2. Would the payment go towards the capitalized interest I still owe or towards the principal? I keep hearing it goes to principal, but idk if that’s the case since I still owe interest that accrued from before March. 

Any advice would be appreciate. I have seriously got to figure these loans out. Not much I can do to pay them down before I start grad school, but I’ll need to know this for after I graduate."

4. I’ve stopped dating for the last year to focus on my finances. I knew it’d be a grind and I didn’t want to share the emotional burden. Excited to rekindle that fire. 
5. I have a bunch of younger siblings about to start college soon. I’d like to contribute some of my income to help them avoid the stress that has loomed over me since I first started college.
6. I really want to be an early home owner. I’m only 23 years old right now, but I’d love to own a home outright before I’m 35.
7. Did I mention I haven’t eaten out recently? Ah I miss a quality served meal. I’d love to just eat out every day for one whole month regardless of cost.

I have money saved up and was hoping to only take a loan of roughly 3.5-4K. However I need a co-signer, and at the moment my mother can’t co-sign as her and her business partner applied for a small business loan and are waiting to get approved. So she doesn’t want her co-sign to cause her business not to get the loan. 

So my thoughts were that I can wait another week or so to see if she hears back, but I’m on a time crunch as the deadline for registration is June 19th. Or I was thinking of opening up a new credit card and splitting the 6k between this credit card and an old one I’ve had. I’d look for a new credit card with great benefits ofc.

Currently, I hold about $25k in federal student loans.  Zero debt anywhere else, only in in my loans. Make about 2.5K a month, maybe more if i decide to work OT.  I will be attending graduate school come January, so i will be taking out more loans, obviously.  My plan pre-covid was to pay the minimums and save money for school, take on the new debt, then consolidate/refi once I graduated and locked down a job. 

Now with the 0% interest I've been paying down a little more in hopes to get a little further.  BUT I've since applied and am now in a good spot to be awarded a US Navy scholarship that will pay me throughout grad school (they wont be paying tuition or the school, just a salary to me every month) starting January 2021 . I will own them 3+ years afterwards which I am very much looking forward to. 

Guess my question is do I continue aggressively paying down loans now and throughout school if I can afford it (while still taking on new grad loans), or simply continue to pay the minimum and continue on with the original plan?  Assuming I am awarded the scholarship, does being an active military member have any benefits on interest rates?  I will technically be active military while in school, but I know my loans will be in deferment at that point.    Assuming I do not get the scholarship, is my original plan a good one?

97,t3_gfla3h,StudentLoans,What's the best way to make payments while there's no interest?,"I have four loans that are currently not accruing any interest through to October due to the CARE act. I'm trying to figure out what the best way to take advantage of this is. When I first graduated, I didn't know much and made the mistake of paying off four small loans with low interest and leaving the larger ones that accrue more. I definitely don't want to make that mistake again as it has cost a lot of money! 

&amp;nbsp;

The loans are: 

* E: 2,920 @ 3.4%

* F: 8,630 @ 6.8%

* G: 12,800 @ 6.21%

* H: 12,300 @ 5.84%

&amp;nbsp;

Normally, for every 100$ that I pay in, I pay $40 to G, $25 to H, $20 to F, and $10 to E. Since the CARE act started I've been putting all my payments towards loan G, as it accrues the most interest. Should I keep making all payments towards G, or should I split it up between the others more? I was thinking maybe 50% of all payments to G with 25% each to F and H. Before CARE, I'd paid ahead enough to not have any payments due until April 2021, but of course they'd still accrue interest. I'd like to keep as far ahead as I can as I'm unable to work much (yay health issues!) and so money is tight."

I am starting an accelerated nursing program which I will be graduating in October 2021. Currently, the school I am attending has awarded me 12,500 in govt loans to help pay for the cost. However, this unfortunately does not cover the entire cost of the program and thus I need to resort to private loans. I have never taken a private loan out and was naive to think that I could just be given one as I have good credit and recently finished paying off my car. So far, every website I have looked at requires co-signers if I want to take out a loan to pay for my school. The few that I found required ridiculous payments of $150 and up a month, which I can't afford as I am already squeezing by till I graduate with what I have saved up for rent and other expenses. As of now, my father has passed away a few years ago, and my mother almost passed away last year and consequently has racked up a ton of medical debt. I am unsure of what to do at this point as I don't really have any family to turn to for help and I have been pretty self sufficient since I graduated high school. If anyone could give me some tips or help on getting a deferred loan without a co-signer, or perhaps some other way of paying for my school that would be great.

My wife and I are currently in our fourth month of student loan debt snowball.  Other than our house and her car, it is the only debt we have.

When we first started in January, we had a combined total of $68,000 to pay off.  She had 3 loans \~$4000, $10000, and $25000 of which we have officially paid off the $4000 one in April.  I have one loan for $29000.

Our next loan to tackle is the $10k one, which I would like to have paid off by the end of the year.  We have been adding $1000-1200 towards the principle plus the monthly to drive down the balance for the target loan.

Is this the right thing to do in terms of paying them off early?  Is there anything else I can do?  I feel like this is going to take forever and feel impatient. We've definitely decreased our spending but aren't eating ramen every night.

My first payment was due in January of $514.70 out of that payment $141.38 went to my principal and the remaining $373.28 was applied to interest. 

My second payment in February was $514.70. $301.02 went to my principal and $213.68 went to interest. 

My third payment in March after COVID hit I paid $514.70 again. Except $316.07 applied to my principal and $198.63 went to interest. 

Why is it that my first payment went all to interest and almost nothing to the principal? Also, If I pay off the interest I accrued and ask Nelnet to apply the $3,900 to the areas that interest accrued will it make any difference?

So I called Nelnet and asked them if they were going to honor that as well with my FEEL loans and never heard back until 2 weeks later, I had a COVID forbearance applied to my account.  So I thought yay, they actually chose to do the right thing.  Only thing is, then I got letters saying I lost my interest deduction incentive for 'non payment, late payment or change from electronic correspondence'.  I have paid double the amount due now for 5 yrs and never been late on a payment.  Even though forbearance was applied, I was still paying small amounts to cover interest.  I just called them only to find out they applied COVID forbearance due to my request ( I never requested it) and forbearance was considered the same as missing a payment, so they removed my interest incentives.

116,t3_gf9etp,StudentLoans,International Man of Being Broke,"Hi r/StudentLoans. I'm sure my abrupt and slightly odd first post makes it clear that I'm new here. But, it is all for the sake of getting as much advice as I can, for as long as I can.

THE PROBLEM:

As a last-minute miracle, deciding in February that I wanted to graduate this year a Junior, my dream University in Paris, France, ESCP, has accepted me into their program. Business in Management, 3-year program over three countries. France, Italy, Germany. It sounds all good and great, I was very happy to receive the news! But alas, comes the dark turn in the story.

See, much to my dismay, ESCP is only an accredited school to institutions in Europe (I.e. EQUIS) and not with the Board of Education here in the US. As a lower-middle-class American, this makes it very difficult as I cannot receive FAFSA support (I'm in the process of filling out my FAFSA anyways, in the event something changes) in any form.

To make matters worse, all the scholarships I've been applying to since last year? They all require the input of the school I'm attending from a [list of accredited schools](https://www.mba.today/schools/france). This isn't the professional source, but it contains the same names of schools in France that all the major websites and banks offer loans for. Not having my school on the list instantly means ineligibility, according to many of the sites. I assume they do this because they are scholarships that they send to the schools, as opposed to grants. Hell, even the pride-and-true ""private loan"" services I run into have the exact same procedure. Makes me wonder why anyone could see much of a difference.

Yearly tuition, for non-French nationals:€22,500

The aid this university IS offering, however, is the ever-so-common exoneration scholarships ""based on financial need"". I send them the financial information of my household, and I can get up to 50% exonerated from my tuition, which I re-apply to each year. The first year, they told me I am eligible for 70%, due to the pandemic (which helps). The following years are all dependent, regardless on the fact that I will be living alone and receiving $0 from family in assistance, on my family's income as well as mine.

ESCP does not offer housing. They do not offer grants. They have partnered with a French bank to give &lt;1% interest on loans, but it is exclusively for French Nationals (loans in general, not just the special deal). I simply need to live in a one-bedroom studio, they go on average  € 600 a month.

TL;DR I am going to business school for $12000 per year but I can't find any loan or funding options because Europe =/= America.

SOLUTIONS:

\#1So far, as I have been working nonstop since January before the pandemic (at a quite nice paying restaurant job), I will have saved up a total of $5000 by the end of May. In order to accept my enrollment into the school, I have to pay  €2500 euros of my year one's tuition by June 29 (I negotiated from the original date, which would have been MAY 11, two weeks after being accepted). Assuming that the minimum salary working minimum wage in Paris is  €1500 (roughly), I can certainly survive working full-time and doing school full-time with enough space between year one and two. That is the option better in the long-run, where I will not have to carry any debt for the first year at least. However, money will be tight, and I will be saving every dime for when I switch countries the next year and have to start all over with a new job and housing arrangement.

\#2I live in a very wealthy town (Naples, FL), and have worked among wealthy people in all the work experience I have gained over the years, even with some of the wealthiest people in the world. I don't intend to come across as condescending, it is just a plain observation I have made. My wealth nor status does not compare to the size of some of these people's careers. I've managed to get names and vague mentions that I may be able to meet with some connections, but otherwise I've been sticking to the internet to expand my network in terms of my education and funding (thanks corona). I may get lucky and someone may throw me a bone and offer me a grant for schooling. Or, one of you may know somebody with such ambitions/foundations/etc.

\#3Perhaps there are businesses out there who offer decent loans for students in my predicament, and hate to make themselves known on the inter webs. If this is the case, I would greatly appreciate some direction towards those organizations. I would at least want to take out a loan for year one, and work to pay off the rest of my education.

\#4

A strange man in a trench coat PMs me that so long as I meet him and his van downtown at 11 at night that he'll pay for my college and potentially throw some candy into the deal. I don't know if I will be able to resist this offer.

TL;DR#2 I can:

* Join the Rat-Race, work full-time
* Ask the CEOs for money
* Find Phantom Loan Company
* ???????

EDIT: Clarity. I'm looking for funding options, and ideas. Yes, I have the alternative of taking the typical path among my peers of going to UF/UCF/USF with my undergraduate paid for by the state, but the remainder is basically the same as ESCP, but now with the ability to take loans."

118,t3_geytyj,StudentLoans,Student loan forgiveness help,Hey guys about a month ago I received a letter from my school saying until further notice I wouldn't have to pay my loan because of all of this going on. Fast forward to yesterday I went to school for a meeting and financial aid said I was 20 days late on my payment and told me she didn't know why I received that letter and is now wanting me to pay the loan. What should I do?
119,t3_getlht,StudentLoans,Should I pay off or wait?,So I recently inherited just enough to pay off my 52k of student loans. I was set to pay this all off in full and now I keep seeing articles pop up that student loan debt relief is being discussed. I have a lot of doubts anything like that will ever pass but should I wait the 4 months (sept when deferment stops) and see what happens or just hand it all over to Navient now?
120,t3_ge3qxz,StudentLoans,I officially have enough money in my account to pay off my student loans and I don't know who else to tell!,"Starting in 2017 I took out $16k in federal student loans to pay for grad school. I graduated in December 2018 but didn't start making payments on the loans until May 2019 when I started being self-employed, at which point I owed $17.6k because of interest.

Thankfully I was on an IDR plan and my monthly payment was $0 because I had no income while I was in grad school. I paid at least $500/month and by the end of 2019 I still owed $12.5k. I felt like was still in so much debt and had a slight breakdown. I had been gifted Dave Ramsey's ""Total Money Makeover"" book, I read it, and I was resolved to really buckle down and pay as much as possible every month.

I was doing really well and had paid all but $7900, but then COVID-19 hit, forbearance and 0% interest kicked in on the federal loans, and I've been saving the money that I would've been using for payments just in case my partner or I lost our jobs (thankfully they seem to be pretty secure).

Anyway, with the money I've been saving, plus the $1200 stimulus payment, plus the $1k forgivable small business loan (which is technically a grant) that I just got approved for, I have $7900 in my savings account. Exactly enough to pay off the loan (which I'll be doing in September once the interest starts accruing again).

I just wanted to share my story because I feel like it's a weird thing to talk about with my family/friends. I'm still in disbelief, and even though I haven't technically made this last payment yet, my current net worth is $63... it's the first time it's been a positive number in over 3 years, and I could cry with how relieved I am to be DONE!"

I consolidated both to MyFedLoan so that all my loans are in one place and so that they could benefit from the current Coronavirus deferment situation. The consolidation payment just posted on both accounts and now I have a positive credit on each account. I called the UAS and asked if they could send write me a check for the amount I have in credit but they said that they would have to send it to the consolidator rather than me and that it would take 45-60 days for this to happen.

Is this right? At least on one of the accounts, the amount overpaid is the exact amount of a payment I had posted the same day that the consolidation check posted, and so they either arrived at the same time or mine was minutes or hours before the consolidation payment arrived at UAS. Is it true that any overpayment in consolidation should be sent to the consolidator rather than to the borrower? I'm alright accepting this if it's correct, but I want to make sure this is the case, as I could use a couple hundred dollars right now to pay for a college course I'd like to take this summer. If this isn't correct, how should I proceed? The lady I spoke with on the phone was pretty firm and was unable to consider other possibilities because she says this is what their policy is.

I had a problem in the beginning of my 3rd semester where my advisor had put me in the wrong class, so I emailed him to put me back into the right one since I had no knowledge of the second level programming course he had put me in. I ended up getting back into that class and I thought things were okay until I went to sign up for my 4th semester classes.

I had found out that I was charged around $800 for dropping that class, even though I was put in that class wrongly. They didn't say anything about it and made me sign a paper saying they were going to take that money for the dropped course from my pell grant and pay it off, but I would have to complete the next course classes or I would have to pay for those in full.

When spring break started my depression came back from my family and I was having suicidal thoughts, I talked to a counselor about the probation and she said they couldn't do that and that I should talk to my advisor to get a refund, but I wasn't able to do so because of the coronavirus and me taking a couple of months to calm down.

Right now I am emailing my counselor to help me with medical leave and to sort out that weird probation, but I am worried I will have to pay back the classes because I didn't do them while taking care of my mental health during these last 2 months.

I really need that money to move out later this year to get away from my abusive family, but they're really controlling over me and have threatened me for my money/pell grant money, and are waiting to see if I have to pay back those classes

129,t3_geh9os,StudentLoans,Adverse credit for gradplus loan,"I'm looking over the requirements for adverse credit for grad plus loans and I am a bit confused.

I read the regulations backwards and forwards. Does someone have adverse credit if the only bad debt they have are chargeoffs from 3 years ago and open collection accounts based on those debts.

It seems that regulations say that when they say open collection account or charge offs within 2 years of the credit report date. In other words someone could not have their debt paid off but since the debt isn't current.....

I even read the response to comments on the Federal Register in 2014 and it talked about a 2 year lookback window as in they are only interested in chargeoffs and collections account in that 2 year window. The other baddies like liens and repossessions kept the 5 year look back window.

Am I misreading it?

I have collections that began 3 years ago but they appear current on my credit report, because each collection agency that buys the debt resets the clock. I have no foreclosures, unpaid federal loans etc. Do I have an adverse credit history? I haven't taken on any debt in the last 5 years, but have old collections I plan to let age off my report. The debts are over the $2085 threshold too."
130,t3_gdwys3,StudentLoans,No longer a Navient “Customer”,"I went back to school in my late twenties around 2009. I transferred to a state university and finished up with a business degree in 2013. At the time, I had just over $40K in loans, and was working odd jobs for a few years. I eventually packed up and moved across the country to an area that was doing well economically. I’ve been working office jobs here for the past four years; I got a certificate in this time and generally spent money on frivolous things when I wasn’t applying it to my loans. This was a mistake. I could have been out of this much earlier. 

I’ve been throwing every extra dollar I’ve earned towards my loans since last October or November. I had a premonition that the economy might be headed into recession given that we’re on a ten-year cycle for it historically. I divested all of my hobby stocks last year and stopped contributing to my 401K to dwindle the loans down quickly. 

I’ve been lucky enough to work from home for an essential company during the COVID-19 pandemic;  I realize that I am in a unique situation and many others have been adversely affected to the point where they are worried about things like rent. I haven’t taken this for granted, and have still lived as frugally as possible. 

Even though payments were deferred through the fall, there was no point in waiting. I paid off the last bit of them yesterday. The dark cloud has been lifted from over my head. There’s no time for celebration. The pandemic is ongoing, and there is still some economic uncertainty. I also have a car to pay down, hopefully before the end of the year. 

I would say to anyone who needs help with their own loans to listen to Dave Ramsey and you’ll get some motivation. He’s not perfect, but he gets a lot right.

132,t3_gecpch,StudentLoans,Getting first time calls on a Perkins loan 10 years after school?,"Federal Perkins loan - Perplexing situation

Good morning Reddit,

There is a problem that has recently come to my attention and I'd like some advice or just to hear if someone has been in a similar situation before:

I've been out of school for 10 years now.  (Since 2010) I had originally defaulted on my federal student loans a few years after that.  I ignored my debt up until about 4 years ago and I called to get everything consolidated and on an income driven repayment plan through fedloan.  After getting everything out of default, my credit started to improve.  My score after 4 years is now in the 800s.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my problem; I've recently been contacted by a debt collection agency named ""Williams and Fudge"" based out of South Carolina.  The representative I spoke to informed me that I owe $3000 on a $1500 federal perkins loan that had, ""fell through the cracks"" and that they were managing it for my university.  I checked my account on the fsa website ([studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov)) and that perkins loan is now there. (It hasn't been on my account until this month)  It says this loan has been in default since 2011...this is where questions start to arise:

Why have I never been contacted about this debt since 2011? My information on record has been up to date for years.

How has this defaulted debt never shown on any credit report since 2011? I thought federal student loans aren't subject to the SoL and never fall off even after 7 years?

If this debt truly ""fell through the cracks"" after all these years, why am I responsible for paying double the original amount in additional interest and service fees that have been tacked on from Williams and Fudge?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Edit:

Going back through on my student loan history and talking to my parents, I had a total of 4 loans. (3 stafford loans and 1 perkins) My parents had taken care of the perkins loan with a lump sum payment to the university in 2011.  When I consolidated 4 years ago, fedloan consolidated my remaining stafford loans, said that was all I had and that I should be in good standing as long as I continue to make on time payments.

I think the university has an error on their end and is now trying to collect on a debt that has already been paid.  Maybe that's why they thought it ""fell through the cracks"".   I don't know what to do if this is the case.  How would I prove that now?  Like i stated, I've been out of school for 10 years.  I've taken care of all my past debt. (or so I was told until now)  I doubt my parents still have paperwork on a debt that was taken care of 9 years ago...I've worked too hard fixing my credit just to have something like this screw it up again...

134,t3_gealbv,StudentLoans,Down Payment or Pay off Student Loans?,"Hi all,

My husband and I have been saving for years for an eventual down payment on a house. He paid off his student loans before he met me, so the majority of the savings is from his years working. We live in  NYC so the housing market is insanely expensive, so our 70k won't go too far. We add about 2k-4k a month (based on OT, etc)

Three years ago I had close to 75k in student loan debt, right now I have about 38k left (I feel really accomplished by this - I started with around 9 different loan groups and am now down to two). 

One group is 7% interest, the other is 6% - right now everything is frozen so I'll be able to make more of a dent while in pandemic forbearance (who would have thought?  - insert Paul Rudd meme here). Long story short is: do we take anything out of our down payment savings to pay off this debt or do I pay off as much as I can during this no interest period &amp; then make regular payments as usual in September? We're so close to our goal of 100K in our savings (will hit that by next summer probably) that I don't like the idea of taking money out. The other side of me knows the 7% return is huge as well. 

To clarify one thing, the reason I'm most hesitant is because my husband has been working for the last 10 years and a lot of this is his savings. I've always managed paying my own student loans because I didn't want to burden him with my debt. He did help me pay off a 7K loan last year, which is huge &amp; I'm super grateful. I've only been making good money for the past \~3 years so that's why my loans have been decreasing steadily, not sure if i should just keep up what I've been doing or pay it off in full.

So I have 3 years of graduate school and I will be taking out $4500 each year because I need to have “income” which is 3x the rent to get an apartment. However, $3500 of that I otherwise do not need to be taking out. Therefore, I would pay back $3500 of the loan immediately and be left with $1000 in actual used loans for the first year. 

1st Year Loan of $4500: Using A = P(1 + r)^t that means this loan will cost me $306 (year 1) + $140.624 (years 2 and 3 based on the 1000) = TOTAL of $446.624. 

2nd Year Loan of $4500: $306 (year 1) and $68 (year 2) = TOTAL of $374

3rd Year: $306 (year 1)

GRAND TOTAL $1126.624 in interest and 3x $1000 of unpaid loans

Is this math correct? Can I pay off part of a loan the same year I get it. And am I missing any other costs that come with federal loans assuming I pay on time?

141,t3_ge29sl,StudentLoans,Can't reach collections agency,"I learned from a recent credit report that my Perkin's loan has defaulted and been placed with the collections agency Eastern Revenue. I would like to rehabilitate and pay off the loan in full asap, but I have not been able to reach anyone via their provided phone numbers. They have never made any attempt to contact me, which is why the loan went into default without my knowing in the first place. I did a master's program after college and thought that all my loan payments would be deferred until I completed my education. That was a stupid oversight on my part, and I'm eager to resolve this, but I have no idea how if I can't reach them. What's the best way to proceed from here?"
142,t3_ge8ib4,StudentLoans,Reconsolidating,"Hey guys, I’m new here so bear with me.

I graduated college in 2015 and finally got a hold on my finances per se. I currently have $50k in private student loans with 8-9% interest (3 separate accounts) and 1 federal loan with $20k. Unfortunately I fell into hard times within the past 2 years and missed 5 payments on my private loan (on my credit report stating 30-60 days late). It hurt my credit score severely and now I’m sitting on a 600 credit score. Now obviously if I want to consolidate my student loans I’ll have to build my credit score. So here are my questions, 1) what’s an average credit score to have to get a good chance of a lower interest rate consolidation? 2) now that I have all my student loans at current (nothing past due) will my past late fees affect the rising of my credit score? 3) when I finally get to a good credit score will the new lender deny me due to the past few late fees* even if I’ve been making full payments now for several months? (expecting 6-12 months until I finally reconsolidate)

*According to credit karma the late payments were within the past year, the last two were January and February 2020 so it was recent. 


Sorry if this sounds confusing, I’m pretty confused myself. Thanks in advance!"
143,t3_ge7kvu,StudentLoans,Question re: Defaulted Private Discover Student Loan,"I consciously defaulted on a PRIVATE Discover Student Loan 8 months ago. I simply stopped making payments, I moved out of the country and have changed my phone number. I have not been receiving phone calls. My co-signer on the loan, who agreed that defaulting was the best decision for both of us, still lives in the U.S. (New York) and said that he is ignoring daily calls from Discover. My co-signer has not and will not make any payments. 

I thought Discover would have sent the loan to collections by now, but they haven't. And they continue to call the cosigner. Obviously I want them to stop calling my cosigner. I also want to avoid going to court if at all possible, especially since I now live out of the country and do not want to have to come back at some future date to go to court.  Here are my questions:

1. Is there a way to get Discover to stop calling my cosigner without acknowledging the debt?
2. Is there a way to influence Discover to send the loan to collection instead of taking me to court?
3. Would logging into my Discover student loan account online be considered an act of ""acknowledging"" the debt and reset the clock for the staute of limitations?
4. Is the Statute of Limitations set by the state you currently live in or the state where you took out the debt? If it's the state where you live, what happens when you live outside the country?

Thanks for any answers you can provide!"

When loan payments were frozen I diverted the monthly payment (as well as other money- I am lucky to be able to work from home so I'm saving on commuting costs etc) to my credit card debt. If I continue this pattern I am on track to pay off all the credit card debt by December 2020. *This includes the assumption that my student loan payment will resume in September.

BUT, now I'm wondering if this is the smartest thing to do? The credit cards have super high interest like anywhere from 21%-24% so I feel like I should pay those first. But then I look at some of my student loans and the way the payment is broken down, some of them only have payments going to the interest and nothing to the principal. So I don't know.
Any thoughts from people who are more money savvy?

That said, watching these horrific interest rates inflate my total debt (my monthly payment covers about 80% of the monthly interest at this point!) is frightening! Is loan forgiveness too good to be true?

I've received interest rate quotes from several of the companies listed above, and they're all fairly comparable to one another.

172,t3_gcp9ka,StudentLoans,Paid off 32k since last Feb!,"Hi all,

I just want to share exciting news that I have paid off almost 32k(31,500) since Feb 2019. This was a Wells Fargo private loan and I graduated 5/2018. I started working 08/2018 and I saved up about 10k. When my loan payments began in 12/2018, I paid the minimum for 2 months until 02/2018 when I forced myself to make a big 10k payment. The loan was split into one that was 14k+ and the other was ~17k. I paid $8,000 on the 14k one and then 2,000 to the bigger one to get the interest down. From there, I closed the smaller loan 04/2018 and then began on the bigger loan. It was hard but I still live at home, don’t shop much, and try to sell things on eBay as I can. I also picked up some babysitting (minimal, maybe made about $500-600) and transcribing for a couple months (maybe $500) but this all went to my loans. Any extra $ I had that I could spend, I put towards loans. I do have a 401k but I only do 3% and I do have a savings account but this is small ($100 a month) and will be until I pay off my debt. I still have about 20k in private loans and 25k in federal. I just refinanced my 20k loans from Sallie Mae from 7-11% interest down to 3.5% interest (used credible and its through pen fed now) so I will start paying this hard. Graduating with 80k of debt while half my counterparts all had school paid for is hard and the fact that I won’t be able to buy a house or move out as soon is also hard but I am doing it!  

I also traveled to Iceland, Denver, Phoenix, Mexico, and Ireland in the past year so I could’ve paid my loan quicker but I don’t want to miss out on experiences and be miserable with just work.

176,t3_gcivpy,StudentLoans,[Visual] I paid off approximately $32k of student loans in 2.5 years and tracked it all through data and graphs!,"Hi everyone, at the end of 2020 I finished my student loan payments! I've been a lurker on here for a while now and am happy to finally join the ""Paid in Full"" club alongside many of you! 

In addition to that though, I also have found an excitement in going through the data from my loan provider during this time and creating some charts for visualization purposes and some eye-opening takeaways. The first graph, [Total Loan Balance Over Time](https://imgur.com/BEgOfSc) shows the life **and death** of all of my 6 loans that I took out throughout my university studies, combined. The second graph, [Individual Loan Balances Over Time](https://imgur.com/zksFbBp) shows the life **and death** of those 6 loans broken out individually - as you can see I approached it via avalanche method. The purpose of doing this all was for me to visualize how interest works between Unsubsidized vs. Subsidized loans and how much it can grow over time. 

As a whole, some key numbers:

- Principal balance paid: $26,400
- Interest paid: $5,200 
- Total paid: $31,600
- Average payment: approx. $1000/mo

I was quite shocked when I realized that out of the total amount that I paid, 16% was in interest, and that's with paying it 4x faster than the 10-year term originally assigned, plus with my highest interest rate loan being 6.8%. I also learned that had it not been that I was continually exporting out my data from my loan provider, it would have been extremely difficult to access the .csv file and data. After I paid it all off, I was still missing some data from the last several few payments and my loan provider pretty much removed all access to my account history and it took several calls/emails in order to get that data as well as all proof of payment. So, lesson for anyone else interested in doing something similar, export out all your data before your last payment!

This was honestly an enjoyable little project for me - I would love to do something similar for anyone that is interested! There are a lot of other personal factors that I didn't want to get into at this time (income, living situation, methodology for payments, etc) but someday I may get more in depth and write a more thorough article or something like that, depending on the reception. I hope this was helpful for anyone or at least different than a regular ""I paid them off!"" post. I'd be happy to answer questions and would love to hear any comments! Good luck everyone!"

179,t3_gcwh1v,StudentLoans,"With 0% interest being applied, balance isn’t reflecting my payment fully","Hello! I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this before or has an explanation for it. I’m still waiting on an email back from the company. 

So. A few years ago my student loans went into default. Last three years my tax returns were taken and applied to it. Which brought down the balance a lot. So I was grateful (although I really wanted that money in my pocket obv but it was my own wrongdoings that put my loan into default). 

Fast-forward to Covid-19 times. Interest has been brought down to 0% on loans, etc. Since my balance was so low because of this years tax return, I had the extra money to put towards it right now so I’m able to fully pay it all off while we are in the 0% era. So the last few weeks I have been putting a portion of my money towards it.

A few days later the payment applies, and part of it goes to principle and just a little over 15% of the payment applies to “other fees and charges.” It is not the interest column because that column is separate and is noted at $0.00.

However, my issue comes in with the new debt summary, amount owed. The balance is still always $80-$100 more than it should be. 

Example: balance is $1000.

I pay $600. $510/600 will show under principal. $90/$600 will go to “other fees.”

So the full $600 was used.

But my remaining balance will say $480-$500 instead of the flat $400. (Like I noted I’m only noticing and asking these questions because there is no interest being applied currently and there is no explanation on the site nor a FAQ page.)

Now I understand there are fees with every loan. But why is it not included in my full balance that I owe? When you do take any loan out I understand you wind up paying more back than you ever borrowed. I can’t help but feel like they’re taking way more money then they should right now or I’m just not fully knowledgable on where the rest of my payment goes? Is it taxes? If so, 15% in taxes????

I'm just try and keep it to facts, and hope that you guys can help steer me in the right direction.  It is a larger amount, which I have since regretted going into, but that's life.

* Loan Amount: 124k across 5 loans
* Tried applying to Earnest and Laurel Road, soft pulls said they needed more details (didn't follow through because I don't want multiple hard pulls on my credit back to back to back)
* A few years of ignoring/forbearance payments because I was barely making 30k/yr and Sallie Mae (Now Navient) wanted 1.2k/month.  That was over 5 years ago and been making on time payments since.  I realize this is a large detriment to me now, but I was young and entirely unsure of what to do, so just ran away from it. 
*Current credit score: 676 and improving

If the only course of action is waiting while still with Navient, then that's just what I have to deal with.  Just trying to make a better situation for myself."

I'm starting school in the fall of 2020 and am in the process for applying for loans and am writing this with hopes to get some guidance regarding my options.

I will be attending from the Fall of 2020 and based on the information I've gathered the program will cost me close $150,000.

I've applied for the Direct Unsubsidized Loan and will be borrowing $20,500. 

To secure additional aid, I will be applying for the Direct Plus Loans. In terms of the Direct Plus Loans, based on the FAFSA website ( [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans) ), when I tried to apply through the website, the university was listed as one of the university that said they are not participating in Direct Plus Loans. I have two questions I would like ask:

1st. Does that mean I will need to apply for a private student loan?

2nd. Due to the current pandemic, I understand current student loan payments are currently on hold. Would anyone happen to know if future student loans are offered at lower interest rate? or offer any additional benefit?

Thank you in advance for your insight.

Best,

190,t3_gceca5,StudentLoans,Question about pell grants and unsubsidized vs. subsidized loans,"Hello! I'm not sure if anyone can help me or not, but I'd appreciate any information given to me. :) Currently, I owe $16,000 in student debt (Bachelor's degree, business management) and my husband owes over $30k for an associate's he never finished. I'm just a little confused about pell grants and unsubsidized vs subsidized loans. When my husband and I went to our community college, we were like 18 or 19 but living on our own. No help from parents and didn't make a lot of money. Probably minimum wage. Somehow, all of my loans are unsubsidized so I've been charged a lot of interest already. My husband, well, I don't know how he owes 30k for an associate's degree at a community college. He went for several semesters, but don't think that's the reason he owes so much. I suspect there were maybe uncashed checks that were never subtracted from his balance. (I'm having him make some phone calls on Monday to find out why he owes so much. More than likely there were no errors, but I just want confirmation before we start paying this debt down.) This is where my question comes in: I know several people around my age who owe no money (or very little) on student debt because they didn't make much money and it was all covered by grants. Why would my husband and I not have qualified for this (we were dating at the time so our incomes weren't lumped together)? Does it have to do with when the applications were put in (first come first serve) or because of the application not being filled out correctly? If it comes down to an error of incomes not being recorded correctly, is there a way to go back and correct this (with proof) to where we wouldn't owe so much federal aid? (I know this isn't likely, but again, I just want to make sure I understand everything before I pay money all this debt off.) If we weren't going to get pell grants, that's whatever, but I really can't understand why we would have been hit with the loans that accumulated interest while still attending school. If anyone has any links that give more info on pell grants, different loan types, etc. I would really appreciate it. We don't owe any private loans, just federal."

192,t3_gcgbze,StudentLoans,Question about Grad Plus endorser,"Hello,  


I am needing Grad Plus loans to pay for school, and I have adverse credit. I will need an endorser. The only person I can get to endorse me is my mother, and besides a less-than-stellar credit score, everything else is fine. She is not 90 days or more delinquent on any accounts.  


However, my mother is now telling me that she remembers having some of her checks garnished, which she made arrangements with the loan servicer (federal loans) to stop the wage garnishments. She isn't a very tech savvy person, and she told me that she wasn't aware she was even in danger of garnishment. Apparently she was told that they tried to contact her multiple times, but she does not recall any letters (doesn't mean any weren't sent; they could have just not been noticed or whatever). She says if she was aware that they were going to garnish her wages and that she was supposed to be paying installments on her student loans, she had the money to do so and would have.  


She has no repossessions and is current on all of her accounts. I am afraid to accept an offer for pharmacy school because if I enroll and cannot secure any funds to pay for my tuition, I will have to withdraw. This will impact future career prospects.  


Is there any way that I can still use her as an endorser on a Grad PLUS loan? I thought about looking into whether or not we can dispute the garnishment (again, her wages aren't being garnished right now and she's making satisfactory payments for multiple months now) due to her not being aware of what was going on. Is there any way that I can explain this situation to the Department of Education to allow me to use her as an endorser?  


Thanks."

We have been together for almost 5 years and are planning on getting married but don't have a date set yet. My question is: if we get married, how will this affect my financial aid eligibility? Will I be eligible to recieve more money in federal loans?  Will I possibly be eligble for a grant if our income is low enough? How low would our income have to be for that to happen?

I am now taking on the responsibility of paying of my parent’s Plus Loans for me (which sadly will be a total of $16k-19k depending on how much interest has accrued/how much they have paid off, wow I really regret taking out $10k to live on campus Freshman year). Since I am making more money now I hope to pay this off in the next year or less.

Although I still have a daunting task ahead of me it is kind of crazy to think about how technically, I personally have zero debt to my name. Paying this off has given me a lot of anxiety ever since thinking about college in high school so I can’t wait to be done with the PLUS loans so I can wipe my hands clean of this experience. I definitely will not miss being nickel and dimed by Nelnet’s insanely long payment processing time.

207,t3_gbzdbl,StudentLoans,How to apply payments during interest free/no payment period?,"I have a somewhat complicated loan scenario, including a private loan at 5.88% and about $140k in federal loans with interest rates ranging from 3.15% to 6.96%. I've looked into refinancing the private loan, but the offered rates aren't different enough to make it worthwhile. My federal loan payment was $733/month. I'm doing PAYE, so my payments are capped as a percentage of my income (obviously, but this point comes back later). I have a kid and a mortgage so I'm not paying a lot extra every month. 

What I'm trying to figure out is whether it makes the most sense to pay down the higher interest loans or the private loan. My assumption is that if I knock off $4398 (6x733) from my federal loans it won't lower my payments since my payment is a percentage of my income and still below the standard payment. So I would pay the $4398 off but then go back to the same amount going towards both the federal and private loans. If that were the case it would seem to make more sense to pay off the private loan faster, because that would actually free up income that I could then turn around and put towards the federal loans. Does that seem reasonable? I wish there was a calculator that I could put my 10 federal loans into and see what my payment would if one of them was $4398 smaller..."

Year 2 Loan would accrue $608/year in interest for 2 years for a total of $1216 by the time I finish law school.

Year 3 Loan would accrue $608/year in interest for 1 year for a total of $608 by the time I graduate.

212,t3_gbggxu,StudentLoans,Consolidate $180k+ or leave it with three service companies? Pros/cons,"I defaulted on 180k of debt a few years ago.  The principal is about 110k and the rest is interest. 

TL/DR at bottom.  

Background - I defaulted because at the time I was married to someone who worked only occasionally (by choice), and I was the sole breadwinner.  What little money I made went to keeping a roof over our heads.   

My job qualifies for public student loan forgiveness. 

My main balance of 144k is with one service company and then I have two smaller loans, 20k each with two different service companies.  

Question - Once the loans are out of default next month, should I consolidate the three together or keep them separate?  I was planning on consolidation but someone told me that consolidating the loans could have a negative impact.  From what I have deduced, consolidating them would be beneficial but I don’t want to consolidate them and then find out I screwed myself by consolidating.  

At least there is a light at the end of the tunnel now with PSLF.  My loans have had a significant impact on my quality of life and for the first time finishing grad school I feel like there is some hope for financial security and I don’t want to do something to screw that up. 

Thanks for any tips or pros/cons for consolidating!!

TL/DR: I have almost 200k in defaulted loans. I’m almost done rehabilitating them.  I have a public job that qualifies for student loan forgiveness.  After rehabilitation, should I consolidate the loans or keep paying the different service companies?

Edit - I don’t have any questions about PSLF, this is just a question of consolidating"
213,t3_gbt2ul,StudentLoans,Are there any dangers in deferring student loan repayment if seeking PSLF?,"I am in a REPAYE program while working at a Community College. My loans are currently in deferment while I am working toward a PhD in Education on a part-time basis until 2024 or 2025, and as a result, I am not making any qualified PSLF payments. I am 46, live frugally, and plan to retire at 62. I drive a 22 year car when needed and try to pay cash as much as possible (Dave Ramsey approach without the PSLF hate). I should add that I am a single empty nester parent with just one income and on a limited budget in a high cost of living area (Northeast) so money is a little tight now. My PhD program is fully funded with nothing out of my pocket this time.  


Financially, I am better off to continue deferring and putting that money into retirement and postponing repayment until I graduate, but I also worry that the government will not honor PSLF someday as I am sure many on here do. So I see my options as the following:

1. Starting making qualifying payments now and get this out of the way.
   1. What happens if I make those payments and the govt wigs out anyway leaving me another 15 years of repayment? I would have been better off deferring in that case anyway.
2. Defer repayment. Put that money into retirement. Make payments beginning at age 51 and reach forgiveness around 61.
   1. Will I regret defferring if the govt wigs out in 11 years when I would have qualified for forgiveness under option 1?  


Background:

I have 236K in student loans. $120 for me personally (B.S. Comp Sci and MBA), and the remainder was taking in the form of Parent PLUS loans for my two kids. I was a single parent and foolish. I consolidated through Great Lakes into Two IBRs which had me paying $800 per month while making $60K per year which I did for 11 months through Great Lakes. It got transferred to Fedloan when I sent in the certification for PSLF. I work at a Community College.    


Fedloan said that Great Lakes put me under a terrible plan, and they ended up reconsolidating me under a single REPAYE that dropped me down to $432 per month. The catch was that my 11 payments counted for nothing and the ""clock"" was reset. Its a long story, and I was almost in tears when Fedloan explained it to me and hence why I am leary of any forgiveness now.  


So anyway, my first payment was due in February, but just after my loan was finalized and the plan released to me, my repayment was put in Deferment as my university sent a letter to them informing that I am a part-time student there until 2024. After talking to Fedloan to ensure nothing in the process was incomplete given the letters timing, I did the math and decided to use this for a year to pay off all my other debts beside my mortgage. I was also able to leverage my college into giving me a new position with a better salary ($79K). I expect to be ""debt free"" by December. Just the mortgage and student loans."

According to the articles I'm seeing from ~2018, MA will consider the discharged amount to be income. This is less than ideal because I'll have an unspecified amount due in tax burden. I also will have an unspecified amount due in tax burden from grants and scholarships I received during my senior year of college (this year). 

I'm trying to decide if it makes more sense to take the discharge and set aside the amount I'd have paid in loans each month so I can cover the tax burden, or if I should waive the discharge in order to preserve the possibility of returning to school someday. 

I looked on the MA website and didn't see anything about tax burdens and loan discharges, but I also might not be looking in the right place. Do y'all have any advice or thoughts?"
216,t3_gbq8xq,StudentLoans,What to do during grace period / before eloping?,"I'm in need of some advice. I have \~$17700 in federal student loans (\~$2200 in one with I think 6.25% interest normally, $15500 in another with 6%), which are currently at 0%/no payment required because of the COVID-19 grace period. I'm already seeking PSLF, have switched my loans to FedLoan, and am on REPAYE. Right now I make about $40k. My fiance makes about $55k and has no student loan debt. We'd been planning on eloping next year (provided we can travel to Ireland by then), and I'm wondering what the best financial steps are for me to take right now. It's also worth noting that I may consider a career change; right now I qualify for PSLF because my employer counts as a non-profit, but I am discovering that I quite like working from home. I've made 33+ payments on one of my loans, and 24+ on the other (not counting whatever isn't popping up since I last certified).

Things I'm worried about:

1. I think I need to switch my repayment plan away from REPAYE because of the impending marriage. I started college in 2006, and I think that means I don't qualify for PAYE -- but could for IDR? How difficult is that process?
2. I don't really understand the difference between filing separately or jointly... I do know that I historically get a refund, and he didn't this year. Is it financially better or worse to file separately or jointly?
3. Should I use this time where my loans are 0%/no payment to pay down my loans? Thanks to the grace period, I just paid off my interest and only have the principal remaining. I could, ostensibly, pay off the $2200 one. Or should I continue to save? I'm trying to get better at money and just now hit $10k in my savings account. Is it better to throw money at my loans or to keep stockpiling because we're looking at some upcoming life expenses?

Advice appreciated. I do not have a head for money at all, and this stuff immediately sets off my anxiety and makes it hard for me to process information, as much research as I try to do!

My current thought process is that I should hold onto money at least until the end of this grace period because who knows what may happen in terms of an extension or relief (a person can dream!), but I am considering the possibly immediate future and what makes good financial sense before a big life change."

221,t3_gbow5l,StudentLoans,Refinancing Advice - $191k,"Hi all,

I’m currently paying down $191k of fed loans on the extended graduated plan with about 20 years remaining. My “discounted” interest rate is 6.63%, which means I’m accumulating somewhere around $1,050 in interest every month. I currently pay $1,200 just to attack a tiny bit of principal but obviously it’s like a drop of water in the ocean and the interest is killing me. 

I’ve explored some refinancing options, but my giant principal means that the monthly payments would be more than I can afford (they’re already severely impacting my lifestyle as is). I have a great credit score and should be competitive for good rates. Should I look into potentially splitting up my loans amongst 2 private companies that way I can at least have a lower overall interest rate while paying roughly the same every month? Does that even make sense?

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: forgot to add that income is ~$85k."

Because of some forbearance and insane interest rates, I have not made much progress with my student loans. When I was irresponsible and naive, I was late on several payments and now my credit score is around 610. I have not missed a single payment of any sort in 18 months, and will have a collection roll off next October.

I made around $40K in 2017, $50K in 2018, $72K in 2019, and (after a promotion to Account Executive in software sales), I should make somewhere between $175K and $200K this year.

I want to refinance, but am curious how to do so with a low credit score. My debt-to-income ratio is getting very good, but is that factored in to refinancing decisions?

For years, I was too shy to post about my situation, but that’s in the past and my head is above water now. Any advice would be incredible.

Another question - beyond my 4% 401(k) match and some savings, should I be putting all of my money into paying off student loans right now?

EDIT: Unbelievable help. From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it. I'm in sales, so the $175K to $200K is a guess, but $150K is a conservative, safe bet. As far as the collections account, it's for an ambulance in college that I didn't want to tell my parents about from a panic attack from getting too high lol. Yikes, I know. There is also a Comcast bill that I am disputing from the year out of college (4 years ago) that I am disputing and honestly expect to get it off the report. I have no mortgages, car loans, etc. I have plenty of late payments around 2-3 years ago back when I was being irresponsible. As for credit card debt, my limit is only $1450 ($750 and $700). Should I be requesting higher limits? Is the hard inquiry worth it?"

1. My question is what best strategy does this person have? What loan payment plans can they qualify for or do?

2. Is it cheaper in the long run to pay as little as possible now, wait for the loans to be forgiven and pay off the tax bomb? Is there a calculator available that will show hypotheticals of if average payment is $100, total will be $XXX,XXX = total paid over 2 years + (.37)Forgiven. 

2a. Is it better to invest in the long run? Hypothetically if the person would get an inheritance of 100k and invest that / use that as last resort emergency fund or just throw it all in the student loan and have no investments + emergency fund

3. Can you theoretically call the loan people and set your payments to like $1/month and still get loans forgiven? What is this payment plan called?

4. Can you get 100% of the payment to go towards chipping away at the principal?

237,t3_gb5hz1,StudentLoans,To Continue to Pay or Not? Considering Opportunity Costs During Cares Act Interest Pause- Federal Loans,"Hi There,

I did the math if anyone is interested I thought it might help. I looked at the scenario where a person had 10K of student loans at 5% - using the standard repayment plan- and whose interest was starting in April as the cares act hit.  Perhaps a bit unrealistic but it was the easiest place to start- imagine a person graduated in March somehow as campuses closed.  The 3 cases I considered are total interest paid and # of months to debt freedom for:

1. Had corona not happened (NO-Vid)
2. Using Cares Act and not paying during the interest pause (Cares Act Case)
3. Continuing payment through this interest pause (Fortunate Case)

In total here is what I found.

* NO-Vid- Total Interest Paid: $2727.70 debt free 120 months from April (April 1 2030 debt-free)
* Cares Act Case- Total Interest Paid $2727.70 debt free 126 months from April (Oct 1 2030 debt-free)
* Fortunate Case-  Total Interest Paid $2334.87 debt free 117 months from April (Jan 1 2030 debt-free)
* Total money saved  $392.83 total time saved 9 months

There are a lot of other variables you could take into consideration that also makes the continued payment interest. For instance- opportunity benefit of investments you could make with that additional 3 months of debt freedom using continued payment.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* I am in no means recommending continued payment- just showing you the math. Things you should consider before making any decision. Do you have a budget set? Is your income safe (relatively sure of continued income)? Do you have an emergency fund set up that aligns with your risk tolerance? These are all boxes you should check before making a decision.

If I go to Uconn, I will be able to graduate debt-free, but if I go to WPI, I will have to take out around $60k in loans. I know that WPI's CS program is a little better than UCONN'S CS program, but I feel that UCONN's CS program is still a great option. I also feel that I'd fit in at both schools. 

But I have heard so many people talk about how graduating college with no debt opens up so many opportunities. At the same time, from what I've calculated, WPI's debt seems to be manageable, but I know it will restrict my spending for several years. And especially during this time of economic instability due to coronavirus, I am worried that when I graduate, I will have to pay a lot more money/pay back for a longer period of time than before. And I have heard that the prestige of your undergrad school doesn't matter that much, even though WPI isn't massively above UCONN in terms of prestige.

So my questions to you guys are: Do you think it is worth it to go to WPI even if I have to take out $60k in loans for a moderately better CS program, or should I go to UCONN and graduate debt free? And how important is it to graduate debt-free?

I'm going to be about 50k debt when I graduate (maybe less if I can save money during internships).

I'm considering doing the 1-year master's program and getting my masters in CS, but that would put me in a total of like 110k in debt (worst-case scenario - the best case is that I find some TA/ Research position and get it down to like 80k). The medium starting salary from our master's program is 115k - Although this includes people who are late in their career and get a masters too.

Like, I said, I don't really know too much about personal finance, but, just based on those general numbers, is this a smart financial decision? or will be crippling myself during my 20s by taking the loans. Like I will eventually also need to buy a car and don't want to have to put that off. 

My parents would be taking out the loans so we can take out the 110k if needed and I would be paying them back. Also, since I'm CS, I'd probs end up working in a high cost of living area like Seattle/L.A

246,t3_gb3ly7,StudentLoans,Where can I get a reasonable loan?,"Hello, so heres the rundown. My gf just graduated from her university with a bachelor of arts in Psychology and a Minor in arts. Shes going to UM in Florida and starting a accelerated nursing program meant to give her a bachelors in nursing in 1 year. She is currently trying to apply for a loan with Wells Fargo, but her cosigner was denied. She told me that since she already has a bachelors she wont get the pell grant from fafsa and that the stafford loan from them will only be about $5k. She needs around $40k for the whole year since UM is a private school. Hoping some of you guys can offer some advice on what she can do. I thought about telling her to use a loan provider like Salli Mae, but I recently read a subreddit where the redditor had a very negative experience with them because of high interest rates. I know basically nothing about applying for loans since Ive only used FAFSA loans my entire college career. Also, she has a credit score of 698, but shes only been building credit history for about year, maybe less. Any advice is appreciated!"
247,t3_gb178i,StudentLoans,Perkins loan before Oct 2007 but still qualified for PAYE,"Hello all,

1. Had a Perkins loan in undergrad in 2005, later on took out loans in 2011 for grad school (while I still had a balance on the Perkins loan).
2. Paid off the Perkins loan before my grace period expired when I graduated grad school.
3. After grace period ended, applied for IDR, was put into PAYE (for grad school loans). Later I was told I shouldn't have qualified because I had an old Perkins loan. Is it because the Perkins loan is technically not considered a Direct loan (and my understanding is that for PAYE, you couldn't have taken out Direct/FFEL loans before Oct 2007)? confused here.

Thanks!"
248,t3_gazwwr,StudentLoans,How do I enjoy my 20s but also pay off my student loans? I'm really struggling with this concept,"Sorry this is a long one, but I need to know if my plan is sound and how to learn how to live my life to the fullest during this financially difficult time. I'm in my early 20s, just finishing up my bachelors degree. I owe $31,000 from this degree, all in federal loans with about a 4.53% interest rate. Now, I've decided to attend an accelerated nursing program starting in 2 weeks, which is costing me A LOT, and I have no federal loans left. I just had to take out a $42,000 private loan with a 10.74% interest rate :( 

So, my plan is to save money while I'm in this accelerated program for the next 16 months. I have enough saved for things I may need throughout my program, like textbooks, train passes, uniforms, emergencies, etc. I'm living back with my parents and can do this for free for as long as I want. My plan is to babysit 1-2 days a week and make $200 a week and save as much of that as possible during my program. My bills each month are less than $300, so the rest is for savings.

I'm expecting to make around $60k after I graduate next fall, which is actually lowballing it for my area and not including overtime or babysitting/side job gigs, which many young nurses end up doing for extra money. I'm very hardworking and have no problem working 60+ hours in a week. 

So, my plan is to save some of the money I earn during my nursing program toward a trip to Europe, travel immediately after I graduate next fall to celebrate before I get a real RN job (if I don't do this now I seriously never will have the time), and then go into a serious loan repayment period for 3 years. 

I plan to live from home, put $2000 a month into my loans each month (pay minimum on low interest federal and sink everything else into my private loans). This will completely knock out my private loans in 3 years. I'll have to live like a broke student for those 3 years, but I'm used to it. I'll basically have just enough to pay my loans, bills and have a little fun each week. 

After those private loans are knocked out, I plan to attend grad school. At this point, I'll have enough experience as an RN to become an NP. I'm looking at nurse anesthetist and psychiatric NP programs in my area. These jobs make well over six figures, so I'm not as worried about the boat of loans that will inevitably come with grad school.

 I know I have a reasonably sound plan to pay off this insane debt quickly (or at least I think?), but I'm having a really hard time grasping the concept of sacrificing everything now for a much better future. If I do this all the right way, I'll have no foreseeable financial stress from the age of 30 on. I just am worried that I'll waste away my 20s, while everyone else is getting married, starting families, traveling, and moving out. I'm just so focused on my career and having a really successful and independent future, but I do want to stop and smell the roses along the way and live out my 20s to the fullest, even if I'm financially suffering. I get so anxious that I'll look back and regret not just taking my time with my loans and enjoying life while I was young. This might sound ridiculous, but it's important to me. How do I find this balance?"

However, the CARES Act seems to have removed at least some of the factors that make it the wrong answer. 

My understanding is that the 10% early withdrawal penalty has been waived. Also, income tax will not be applied to the withdrawn funds as long as an equal amount is paid into a qualified retirement account within 3 years. These provisions are stated in the CARES Act Division B, Title I, Sec. 2103 (see link). 

I'm very tempted to pull $50k from my retirement to put towards student loan debt. Background info: my income is $160k, student loan debt is $95k with avg. int. rate of 5.8%. Also, my employer has historically contributed 10% of my income to my retirement. 

The main drawback I can see is that I will obviously have less money in the market and therefore will miss out on its growth as our market recovers.

251,t3_ga88h8,StudentLoans,Just Paid Off My First Loans,"
Just wanted to share the good vibes and encourage those who are struggling that it is possible. It was hard to picture paying any of them off when we first started out, but with some simple budgeting and a little self discipline it’s possible!

My wife and I had five loans between us for a total of $40,000 when we graduated three years ago (which I don’t think is that bad for a combined 12 years of college). We don’t make a lot of money considering we each have Masters degrees, but we’ve been pretty aggressively paying off our loans with the income that we have.

We decided to use the stimulus payment and some money from our fairly healthy savings and pay off two of the five loans.

We now only owe about $13,000 and we expect to pay the rest off in about 14 months (assuming neither of us get a better paying job). We’ve been using the avalanche method and are both now excited for the “avalanche” to start gaining momentum."

258,t3_gam9b6,StudentLoans,Considering taking out a 401k loan to pay off remaining student loans... Advice?,"Hi folks, new to this sub, and considering potentially a large financial decision. I feel pretty out of my depth here, and could use some advice.

Short version is, I'm a college dropout with approximately 10k in student loans. I attempted to attend college while working fulltime because I'm a total lunatic, it didn't work out, and I eventually had to make a choice between the two. Steady gainful employment won out.

I'm looking at ways to reduce (or completely eliminate) my debt, and as of the passing of the CARES Act, I'm looking toward my 401k. I've only had it for seven years so I don't have a ton of money in it, but I do have enough to pay off my remaining student loans. My question is, would it make sense to take a loan out of my 401k for $10,000, in order to completely pay off my tuition?

The tuition loans have a 5.05% interest rate, and while I DO make enough to make the payments, it keeps my finances pretty tight, and makes it almost impossible to save any significant amount each month. With the interest being waived until September, I know I could stop making payments for awhile, but I'd rather find a way to get rid of the debt, for the sake of my credit score and overall peace of mind. I'm no genius when it comes to finance and tax law, but what I THINK I'm reading suggests that I could take the money out of my 401k at a lower interest rate, crush my student loans, and then essentially pay myself back over time, albeit with lower monthly payments.

Does this make sense to do? Are there any angles I'm not seeing? I have a decent job with relatively good security, and provided I don't get sick, I'll continue to work through the COVID19 crisis. I've made some questionable financial decisions in the past, and am in the process of repairing my credit, so I wanna make sure this isn't gonna hurt me down the line, before I make any decisions.

Any advice I could get on this topic would be HUGELY appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I thus wish to take the personal loan and take very little of the Federal loan. If I disclose my personal loan to the financial aid office, will this negatively affect my financial aid package?

However, for my freshman year, I do have enough in savings that I could get by without taking out any loans. But this would mean that I would only be able to get 21.5k in federal loans overall and would have to have 18.5k in private loans eventually. From my current understanding, federal loans are usually better than private loans. So would it be worth to take out the max federal loan my freshman year and have an extra year of interest on 5.5k in loans so that I don’t have to take out as many private loans?

In 2001 I took out a private loan with Sallie Mae for $50k ($25k tuition/$25k living in Seattle) to attend a tech program. My dad and stepmom co-signed, as my credit was not the best. It was a 9 month program and the living money was split into 3 installments, with the tuition paid up front. The school proceeded to file for bankruptcy at the 7 month mark, right before my last disbursement. So all told, the amount borrowed was $42k. 

I was stuck in forbearance for a few years until I got on my feet, then started making payments. The loan was sold to Navient about 10 years in. With all the payments I made, the balance only went down to $32k. During this time, I managed to get my credit in great standing and got my stepmom removed from the loan, but they wouldn’t release my dad. Fast forward to 2019, I had lost my great job, run up debt trying to survive while working multiple jobs, and decided to declare bankruptcy. On my lawyer’s advice, I stopped paying Navient when the case was filed. She said, depending on the trustee, they could ask for the money I paid to Navient back from them to distribute to other creditors. 

I had my hearing in October 2019 and everything went smoothly and went through with no issues. I had kept an eye on my credit report and Navient was listed as on hold pending the hearing. I knew there was a possibility of them going after my dad for the balance. By January 2020, Navient was listed as closed on my credit reports. They did reach out to my dad, but he passed in early January. My stepmom sent them a copy of his death certificate and she hasn’t heard from them since. I finally got the balls to log in to my Navient account this week.... and the loan is gone. Not even the payment history is there. The history only exists on my credit report now. 

Has anyone else had this happen? I haven’t had any contact with the company since I filed for bankruptcy. For the record, I had downloaded an Excel file of my payment history last summer, and to that date I had paid back the principle and $17k in interest. 

TL;DR my private student loan disappeared after I declared bankruptcy."

I also plan on consolidating/refinancing my loans as soon as possible after college. I cannot take out any parent plus loans, since my parents won’t be supporting me through college. Which means a portion of my loans will have to be taken out in private bank loans. This college is the only college for me (trust me I’ve looked at quite a few) and my major/dream job cannot be done in any other location. I’ll be majoring in arts and entertainment management and interning at companies like ESPN, SONY, ABC, GMA, etc in the heart of New York City during my schooling, which will give me a far better chance of securing a job at these companies.

283,t3_g9wk5y,StudentLoans,REPAYE vs PAYE questions for married folks with dual income,"Hey there, I will be starting residency this July and really need some advice in exploring student loan repayment options. I have a spouse and she will be making an income as well which complicates my choice of repayment. Below I'll outline my story just so there's a grasp on what it is I'm looking for:

Essentially, I will be 140k (principal 127k) in debt starting residency this july with an average interest rate of 5.9%. Salary for next 4 years starts at 57k then increases by 1k each year. This will most likely quadruple after 4 years to 250k-300k as an attending salary. My wife, whom I just recently married last month, is studying to be a dietitian and she will complete her internship and start full time around July 2021 making around 50k. She has been working part time, made 20k in 2019, and will make around 10k in 2020. She will have about 54k in loans at a 6.0% interest rate by the time she finishes her internship.

My long term goal is to work in an opioid treatment program, of which NHSC is providing up to 75k in student relief in exchange for 3 years of working there. Because of this and the fact that my loan isn't too hefty, PSLF isn't a big concern to me. My plan was to do REPAYE in residency to take advantage of the interest subsidy, and refinance after residency to avoid the no cap on monthly payments REPAYE has put in place (I'd like to save up for a house, support family, invest retirement rather than put more money than my liking toward student loans that I can still pay off relatively quickly after refinancing). But....

I've used the loan simulator [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) provided and it says REPAYE is best option in residency. However, the monthly payments on my loan will spike when accounting for her income when she starts full time in July of 2021. **Is REPAYE really the best option for me? Would I be saving money if we filed taxes separately and did PAYE instead? Just not sure which one is better for us in the long run or short term and need some help crunching numbers together. I would greatly appreciate any help at all, I tend to struggle in grasping financial jargon.**

290,t3_g9uotp,StudentLoans,Clueless First Generation College Freshman. Send Help.," 

Hello everyone,

I have a few questions and I know some of them may seem silly, but as the title suggests, I am a first generation college student trying to figure things on my own and I have no clue who to ask, so here I am on Reddit!

A bit of background information: I am a 21 year old freshmen. I do not qualify for FAFSA/federal loans for personal reasons, so my only option to pay for school is to take out private loans.

Anyways. I was accepted to my state's university. When I found out I was accepted, I got really excited and couldn't wait for Fall, so I made a last minute decision to attend summer semester.... which starts next week. I emailed my university asking if it was too late, and they informed me that (University) does not drop classes for non-payment and that instead I will get a $40 late fee and after 5 weeks I will start getting 1% interest and collection fees for every week that passes by. I can still attend my classes even if my payment does not come in time for the deadline.

So, I know I messed up by not planning ahead and figuring stuff out. Again, I have no idea how any of this works and I'm completely on my own for this. My question is, when should I take out a loan and how much? Or should I just take out one loan for the entire four years I will be in University?

So sorry for the silly questions and sorry for any grammar errors English is my second language! Any help would be appreciated, thank you so much. :)"

293,t3_g9rzgx,StudentLoans,How would I pay off 300k in loans?,"I’m really confused about interest rates and I’m trying to figure out how long it would take me to pay off 300k. My plan is to go to medical school. I currently have ~ $200,000 to put towards undergrad which costs $75,000 a year. Therefore, I would need to take ~$100,000 in total loans between my junior/senior year. I would also probably need to take out ~$200,000 in loans for medical school. I don’t qualify for federal loans so almost all of it would be private loans. My plan is to be a psychiatrist which has a median salary of ~$170,000. I won’t be making decent money until ~8 years after undergrad and 4 years after med school. I just don’t know anything about loans or what my options are to defer payments with private loans or what options there are for interest rates. If anyone could help put it in perspective that would be great. Sorry of this was confusing.


Edit: I understand that it’s better to go to a cheaper school for undergrad but I’m just interested in figuring out hypothetically how long it would take to pay off. I don’t need people telling me it’s a bad plan and instead I’m trying to figure out actual outcomes that can help me come to my own conclusions that’s it’s a bad plan financially."

Or should I just do travel therapy after COVID stuff calms down, in more of the YOLO mindset and see new sights/meet new people versus stress so much about PSLF? My current employer is great but it is a very boring area and I would love to travel if able.

Also, I heard that there may be some sort of ""Hero Fund"" after all of this COVID stuff calms down, and I do work for the ICU/inpatient unit currently.

301,t3_g9fhgj,StudentLoans,Wells fargo student loans,"I have a wells fargo student loan currently for $7,300. I have been paying on it for close to five years and am just got below the initial balance I borrowed. The interest rate is variable and currently at 7.74%. My mom is a cosigner on this loan and she has great credit. I can't afford to mess up her credit however I have a credit score of about 600. 

What is my best option? Should i try to get a personal loan to cover it? Should I find a way to get it in my name and not my mom as a cosigner and default on the loan to pay it off in one lump sum and settle the debt? Is it just best to continue making larger payments than required when I can? The interest rate eats away at most of what I apply to the loan so it doesn't really seem to be decreasing much more than $20 a month when I pay about $100 towards it. How can I get rid of the debt the fastest? If I got the debt in my name only should I file for bankruptcy to try to clear it and restart? I don't know how to make it go away as soon as possible. I didn't finish school and only went for about a year and work a job I can't make more than 30k a year currently.

302,t3_g9kek0,StudentLoans,Is now a good time to transfer to FedLoan for PSLF?,"So I have one consolidated loan that has been on REPAYE with Great Lakes for almost 2 years while working for a qualifying employer. I have not submitted my first ECF to trigger the transfer from Great Lakes to FedLoan because so far I’ve had a good experience with Great Lakes and why change a good thing?

The CARES act got me thinking it may be a good time to transfer my loans to FedLoan to take advantage of the administrative forbearance our loans are in right now anyways. Great Lakes told me the other day that at the end of the CARES act it’s going to take 30-45 days to issue our first payment due date, so even though CARES ends Sept 30, our first payment won’t actually be due till sometime in November, effectively making us miss one qualifying payment, pushing the forgiveness date out one month. This is apparently standard when leaving any type of forbearance. 

My understanding is when transferring to Fed Loan, there may also be a delay in getting your payment set up right away and therefore making you miss a month and push your forgiveness date out again. Because our loans are qualifying for PSLF right now due to the CARES act, seems like the perfect time to transfer and eat the one month missed payment at the end of CARES instead of two, one at the end of CARES and then another down the road when I transfer to Fed Loan.

Wondering if anyone else has thought of this or has thoughts if this might be a good or bad idea?"

Right now I can afford to pay off the loan entirely, but have decided not to due to pandemic forbearance period.

306,t3_g9ae2c,StudentLoans,"hey student loan gurus, i need some advice about how to handle 3 fed loans","i was an a-hole and haven’t paid on 3 of my student loans in... years. my credit already blows because of that, so i get it. i’m trying to fix the mess.

i had to file forebearance frequently due to life circumstances (original grant: $16k). obviously i have accrued a lot of capitalized interest, so i haven’t even touched my principle with the payments i have made. my DTI ratio on my credit report is well over 100% now, and since my partner and i want to purchase a house in the next 2-3 yrs, i have to clean that up. (i have 0 other debt, personal loans or collections.) 

come mid september, my plan is to pay off the current interest accrued on these 3 fed loans through navient ($5,296) and potentially do a direct loan consolidation. 
would that help my DTI ratio by resetting my loan repayment? i believe i’d get a 6.15% weighted interest rate using my current rates, so it’s not a huge loss (to me; am i wrong?) i want to get these paid off in 5 years max. 

1. original loan: $5,500. now total is $8,633 (subsidized) 
- [ interest: $1,559 (to be paid off 9/25)]
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,074 @ 5.6% int

2. original loan: $5,500. now total is $8,889 (subsidized)
- [ interest: $1,698 (to be paid off 9/25) ]
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,191 @ 6% int

3. original loan: $5,000. now total is $9,656 (FFEL unsubsidized) 
- [ interest $2,039 (to be paid off 9/25) ] 
- [ ] new prin balance: $7,617 @ 6.8% int 

total principle: $21,882 

TLDR: is direct consolidation for a former serial federal loan forebearancer a good idea, or should i just stick to my existing navient/dept of ed loan terms (payment until 2030 as the plan stands)? is there even a point? i’m not looking to refinance to a private loan.

The average interest rate is just North of 5 percent. 3.1k is at 6.8%. My monthly minimum is 526. If I eliminate the 6.8% debt  which is across three loans, my new monthly minimum will be 441 or an 85 savings each month.

My plan was to continue paying 525 over the next 6 months of deferal and Target the 6.8% loans to wipe them out and reduce the monthly minimum when we are on the other side of the COVID deferral.

Where I am struggling is I know it is not advised to prepay interest free debt which this essentially is right now. However in my view it's only a matter of time until that interest clock starts again. Also I know I could pay a lump sum of the 3.1k right before the defferal period ends for the same result but that is just a harder cash flow pill to swallow pyschologically I suppose.

My other debts are an auto loan at 3% and mortgage at 4.75%.  I already have an emergency fund saved and would be able to pay this down out of operational cash flow pending nothing happens to my employment in the foreseeable future.

315,t3_g966it,StudentLoans,COVID Cost me income; Need additional loan for rent,"For background, I am currently a law student and took out the Stafford loan and GradPLUS loans to cover my tuition and cost of living for this school year. I only took out enough to cover up until I started working this summer. I did not use my parents as cosigners. Unfortunately, because of COVID, my clerkship has been postponed and as a result I cannot cover rent for this summer yet. My parents advised that I take out another private loan to cover rent, which makes sense to me. They are unwilling to lend me money as they are planning for retirement and my father lost his job as a result of this a few years ahead of schedule. While we are not in dire straights, it is apparent that beyond cosigning, I am on my own. 

With a cosigner, I easily get approved for a loan for the summer term from private lenders (So far only looked at Sallie Mae). The issue is, I am not taking summer classes. The student loan is approved subject to pending approval from my school. I am worried that the school will not approve the loan because it is not covering school tuition, rather, it is covering living expenses. Additionally, am I exposed to some sort of liability for taking a school loan and not using it for the summer term? I don't want to commit fraud or something in doing so. If this is not an option, please advise what type of loan/lenders should I go to to get a loan to cover my cost of living for (at least) the next 6 months until I can work again."

We do file taxes jointly and get our tax refund taken as well.  My question is, is it worth getting out of default?  Would love to get the tax refund next year (at this rate would be paid off in 1-2 years)

We make no payment other than the wage garnishment which is about 200-225 every two weeks.   We do have about 10k worth of CC debt we need to get taken care of. (At least will be taken care of due to no garnishment currently)

Should we do a rehabilitation to get out of default?  Will they include my income when looking at how much we agree to pay per month?  and continue to garnish (after sept?)?

If we don’t get out of default, will that eventually go away on her record?  It’s currently not on credit reports but the loans left are definitely in default.  We plan on buying a new forever home in 3-5 years and would like to have her be on the mortgage to get approved."

Currently, my state and federal tax refunds are being redirected to pay my loan off. I was fine with it at first because my refunds weren't that much. Now I am making a lot more money and would rather pay a monthly to the loan rather than lose my tax refunds. Plus I think this would be the time to renegotiate.

My question is if I start paying off my student loan, will they stop taking my refund? If so, how do I go about doing that?

I'm looking for people who've been through this or know what I am talking about and not people who ""guess"" how to do this.

EDIT: I can't help but to see the irony in that some people are asking how can someone with a degree not understand how tax refunds work, but they lacked reading skills. My debt came from grad school. Stuff happened that affected my finances and paying off a student loan was not a priority especially when they had the wrong amount. That was five years ago.

I am making more money now and would rather pay a small monthly amount, write off the tax interest and keep my tax refunds which are going to be sizable. This has nothing to do with tax refund common sense. This has to do with managing the bureaucracy.

340,t3_g7zyxv,StudentLoans,Wages Being Garnished - Best Way to get out of Default?,"Hello, 

Obligatory notice that I'm a dumbass for not dealing with this earlier. 

With collection fees, I have a 5-6K federal student loan in default with Coast Professionals. I got a notice in the mail in February about wage garnishment. I spoke to someone previously about the loan rehabilitation process, but there was a section I wasn't sure how to fill out. I tried to get in contact with Coast Professional several times for help filling out the form, but this is when the Coronavirus hit. I couldn't get through when I called. Sometimes I went straight through to voicemail which prompted me to leave my contact information, saying someone would get back with me, but they never did. 

I started making monthly payments of around $250 or so through the [myeddebt.ed.gov](https://myeddebt.ed.gov) website a few months ago. I just filed 2018 and 2019 taxes a few weeks ago, and I noticed that my wages were being garnished in the [mydebt.ed.gov](https://mydebt.ed.gov) website ($700-800/month!). There were garnishments listed for February, March, and April, but no money had been taken out of my paycheck, according to my bank account. 

I  know my options are consolidation, rehabilitation, or payment in full. I only have one loan so I don't know if consolidation makes sense, and I think I can pay the loan off faster than the 9-10 months that it would take to rehab. Plus, when I called Coast Professional before, they were pretty dodgy about the rehabilitation process. We could probably afford to pay in full but I'm nervous to have less of an emergency fund in case my wife gets furloughed due to the Coronavirus.

Is there any way to stop the wage garnishment? I plan on calling them ASAP, but I'm not sure what my best option is. I'm eager to set up a plan. Thanks for your help; I know it's not a large loan, but I'm still really freaked out."

Here's the thing though, I applied honestly thinking I wouldn't get in and never thought this far ahead. I missed the deadline for Cal Grant because I forgot I even applied and I was planning on taking a gap year since I already finished all my general ed classes. 

I applied for these majors because I'm passionate about sustainability and the environment; I don't know why but it just felt right to pursue it as a major. But I don't know what careers I would even be able to get with these degrees. I don't know if I want to take out $70,000 in loans for a bachelors, esp since I'm not even sure what career I want to pursue. 

I've been at a community college for two years so I didn't have to deal with any loans, and I was in a program that covered the cost of my classes. I know nothing about loans to be quite honest. The net costs for a year is $35,140 and I'll be attending for two years. My EFC is ~8700 if that matters. My parents claim me as a dependent but they're not contributing to my education and I fully support myself, although currently I have no income because y'know, pandemic.

I didn't plan to contribute much to my 401k this year since I'm poor but now I'm thinking I can lower my student loan monthly payments and get a 3 year deferment on my taxes.  Would this plan work?

Contribute paycheck company max to 401k plan 75%.

Cap 401k limits 19k I believe over the next few months.

Withdraw contributed funds once 401k annual max is hit with no 10% early removal penalty and gain the ability to repay the income tax over the next 3 years.  This is turn reduces my AGI 19k thereby reducing my income based student loans in the future and it lets me pay back the income tax over the next 3 years whereas If I took normal paycheck contributions, it would be due immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a win from all angles.

1. Lowers my monthly income based student loan payments in the future since I'm going for forgiveness.
2. Gives me a 3 year loan on my income taxes on the monies deposited into my 401k since the tax can be paid back over 3 years.
3. Obviously my 401k funds would be put into a money market investment fund with low risk to not potentially lose money while waiting to hit the annual max."

I am a fourth-year medical student going into anesthesiology with 147K school debt. I am trying to choose between PAYE vs REPAYE loan programs. I can't find an answer anywhere to what exactly happens when you no longer qualify for PAYE. I understand that 10% of your original principal interest (14.7K in my case) capitalizes. Does the rest of your interest stay as it is or does it go away? 

Also, apparently, after PAYE, you never pay more than what you would pay under a 10-year standard repayment plan. Is the principal amount used in this case to calculate your monthly payments is the original amount or the new amount after capitalization (14.7K + 147K in my case)? 

My another question is what is the income cut-off for you to no longer qualify for PAYE?

Finally, for someone who wants to refinance loans later, is REPAYE a better option because of the interest forgiven during residency?

Thank you!!!"

I decided to go back to school this spring and finish my undergrad. I enrolled at a local/online school, and plan to graduate this December. I applied for financial aid and took out a subsidized loan. Now that I am in the swing of things and figured out how to balance school and my FT job, I decided I am going to continue and get my MBA/M.S. (different institution). I have one random UL elective to finish, which led to what I though was a good idea: I am going to take a grad course and have that fill my last elective while already starting to work on my grad degree. Since I am not considered an official grad student yet, I was told not to apply for financial aid through graduate school.

My questions is, for my 20-21 FAFSA, can I take out subsidized/unsubsidized loan and use that to pay for grad courses? I also received two checks for my spring semester, since it was in excess of my course cost (I know some people use these for books, supplies, housing, etc.). I assumed the correct thing to do with the excess is just to pay down the balance...but I wasn't sure if I could use that or additional financial aid to pay for my grad courses. From what I researched, the have a different interest rate. So I wouldn't want to be dishonest about that. 

Any feedback would be great. I would rather not have to pay out of pocket for my first two courses, as the grad school cost per credit is much greater then what I am paying for undergrad."

I think around 350-400 is a reasonable one to get me through grad school without breaking again. And also a suit for interviews, I don't have one. Suit supply has some entry level ones for 350.

So how do the funds get to me? And when? I think they go to the school first, and would the leftover go to me to help me get there and settle in with the move? I'm freaking out since I'm not able to work and save as much money as I planned with the virus. "

I ended up in software sales and started my first job in June 2018 making $31k base and no commission, living with my parents. Come December 2018, I accepted a different sales job with a $50k base and $75k OTE (with commission), moved out into an apartment in May 2019. Then in September 2019, I accepted my current job with a $75k base and $95k OTE (!!!!) 

Fast forwarding to current day, I still have $25k left on my student loans, but own a new car in full and am not far from the ultimate goal of paying off my loans! I’m not here to brag or anything like that, more so to make it known that paying down your debt is possible if you really put your foot down and make sacrifices, like living at home if you can and cutting expenses where possible. Also, for those who are unsure of a career field, sales/software sales can be very lucrative.

I already have a job working for the city in my field that pays $55k, and I've been saving a lot the last few months in spite of COVID19 shutdowns (very privileged/lucky to do that). City jobs are about to be frozen and more unpredictable with more budget cuts, but overall I think I may be safe from that. However, I have reason to believe (without going into too much detail) that my job might be a little insecure in June/July due to a change in leadership. Not sure what the probability is on that, but it's not 0.

With a loan amount of \~$24,000 (\~$1000 of that is interest accrued so far), should I throw some of my savings at the principal/interest balance while I have the money in this forbearance period? Or at least pay off all the interest right now? I don't think I could save enough money to factor in a monthly loan payment for the forseeable future unfortunately if I did lose my job.

372,t3_g6y9hg,StudentLoans,What loan repayment plan would you pick?,"Hi, I'm a graduating medical student faced with the decision of what loan repayment plan to pick (REPAYE, PAYE, IBR) and I'm pretty lost.

I have 169,000 of debt (all direct stafford loans at 5.3-6.6% interest rates) with about 10,000 in interest so far. My interest will capitalize in September when I pick my repayment plan, but I shouldn't collect more until then because of the CARES act w/ covid.

I'm looking at a 3 year residency making 66-68,000 a year. Then I'll go to fellowship for 3 more years and make about the same amount. I expect I'll move into an academic hospitalist position after fellowship (so six years from now) and make around 150,000.

Here is where I get confused. I'm looking at getting married in 3 years. My partner would likely be making 120,000 at that time and he has no debt. He doesn't feel responsible for my medical school debt and isn't sure he wants to contribute to my loan payoff. Fine, and honestly fair, it is my debt. The problem is his income will be included in my REPAYE AGI calculation and in my PAYE if we don't file taxes separately. I don't know how to predict how filing separately would impact our taxes and if that would make the difference with PAYE even worth it. I'm considering PSLF, which would make REPAYE with the payment cap important given our income differential, but I'm not sure it will even be around when it comes time for me. Making those low payments would massively balloon my debt if I went that route and was wrong.

I'm lost and don't know what to do. Anyone have any thoughts/advice?"

I was told by someone to refinance my loans for lower interest and low payment. I checked with Creditable and SoFi. I was only able to get a rate with Credible.

They didn't have any advice besides ""wait and see if you get any more calls.""

376,t3_g70b2w,StudentLoans,Loan Servicing Cost - Stafford to Direct Consolidation Considerations,"So I'm not sure if anyone can answer this but I am wondering what it costs a company to service a loan. Does it depend on the balance/monthly payment or is there a ""floor"" or fixed cost that it will never be lower than to generate statements and what not.   


I am wondering because When I first graduated in 2007 I had about seven Stafford FEEL loans totaling about $20,000. I threw any extra money I had at my student loans and often ended up sacrificing something to do so. I told the servicing company to put the extra at principal and NOT to pay ahead, BUT they payed it ahead anyway. I didn't find this out until years later when it showed almost a full year of payed ahead status. Shortly after finding this out they sold my loan to Great Lakes so there wasn't much to do about it. Well the years went by with Great Lakes until they themselves resold my loan back to my original servicer.  


I am now considering consolidating six of the remaining Stafford loans to a Consolidated Direct loan. I owe about $7,000 and the APR's on the loans are 6.8, 6.55, 4.66, 4.66, 4.66 and 4.66. One of the 4.66% loans only has a balance of $229 left. Basically I am wondering the cost to the company to service that $229 with a $3 monthly payment for the full remaining eight years. By leaving this loan out of my consolidation I will be paying a higher interest rate since Direct consolidation loans get their interest rate by averaging the rates of all the loans. so my new APR will suffer slightly with one less 4.66% loan to add in.  If I calculated correctly it would mean a rate of 5.46 instead of 5.33 so this slightly higher rate will cost me about $10 a year extra just to keep the tiny loan out of the consolidation.   


As I understand it servicers only get about half of a percent of the monthly payment they process so they would get about 15 cents a month in revenue off my loan. If the cost to service a loan has a fixed ""floor"" and that cost is say $4 or $5 I would say it might be worth spending $10 a year to make me feel better about them stealing all that money in extra interest from me back in 2007/2008 by paying ahead and not extra towards the principal, but if that cost to them is only a $1 a month it prob isn't worth the cost. Anyone know how to find out? Thanks for any help you can provide."
377,t3_g6z8nq,StudentLoans,Entrance Loan Counseling,"Hey all,

I am planning to start my Masters in the Summer semester here in a few weeks but needed to complete an MPN and Entrance Loan Counseling. I signed the MPN and completed the Entrance Loan Counseling but the way I was understanding the ELC form was to be on a purely informative basis and not something treated as an official form to base any loans or repayment off of. I left some numbers like estimated housing costs provided by the school unchanged so when I got to the end and submitted it popped up with a summary page where it stated something along the lines that the information I provided will be reported to my loan servicer. I wanted to ask if I need to complete another form and ensure every number is accurate as it also had me estimate what I expect to make after I finish my degree and the typical salary is $60k in the ideal job that I am aiming for so I put that but it also started basing repayment numbers off of that and I've had at most a $30k salary in the past.

381,t3_g6e05a,StudentLoans,"$92,500 in loans, still have 1 more year of college need advice","Hey everybody, I'm in need of advice

I currently have $92,500 in loans, and I don't know how to pay for my last year of college.

I also have a plan for what to do after graduating, and wanted to hear opinions on it

I'm currently finishing up my junior year of college, and I don't know how I want to pay for my senior year.  I, like many other kids, stupidly took out expensive loans so I could go to an out-of-state college, and even though I am getting a good degree (Mechanical Engineering), I still regret the amount of debt I have put myself into just for an education.  I wish I had spent my first 1.5 - 2 years at commumity college so I could save a lot of money, but it's too late for that now.  It only recently just hit me just how much debt I'm in, and I'm really sad and scared about it and what to do. 

Here are my current loans:

Private loans: (Only paying interest while still in school)

$35,000 5.19% 15 year

$38,000 5.6 % 15 year

Federal sub/undsub loans: 

$19,500 \~4.5%

My last year of college will be \~$35,000, minus the federal loans ($7,500) I accept  for the 2020-2021 school year, so that means I still have to come up with around $27,500 for my senior year.  Should I take out another loan? I can't take a year off school to work and save money to pay for my senior year because I will have to start making full payments on my existing loans and won't be able to save enough.  I really don't want to go over 100k in student loan debt, but it looks like that is the only option to be able to graduate.

My father has told me not to be scared about this, and he says when I graduate I can still live home rent free, and he will help pay a little bit each month.  I know for mechanical engineers the starting salarying ranges from 60-65k a year, and since I am close to NYC I know that starting salaries are closer to \~70k.  My first engineering intership I had was in NYC, so I am used to the travel there for work.  Since my only debt is my loans, my father told me I can make double and triple payments on my private loans the first \~2-3 years, and that will lower them a substatial amount, especially if I get a good entry level job.  At the moment, I'm not very worried about paying off my federal loans faster than my private loans, because the interest rates are lower.  With my private loans, I have calculated that if I make double payments on my private loans they will be paid in about 5.5 years opposed to 15 years, and I will save &gt;$22,000 in interest. If I make a little more money I could pay even more than double payments too and pay them off even faster. 

To Summarize:

\-I still need to pay for my last year of college and I really don't want to go further into debt, so I am hesitant about getting another loan, but it looks like its the only choice.  (Go from 92.5k total in loans right now to \~128k total after graduating)

\-To deal with my loans, my plan is after I graduate I hope to find a good job in NYC while living with my parents. They said they wouldn't charge me anything for rent or food, and I will be able to put most of my salary into my private loans through double or more payments since I have no other debt, and I will likely just pay the minimum on my federal loans unless I can pay more since they are low interest."

Here’s my scenario: I got into Vassar, and I’ve fallen in love. I’ve made some connections with other admits, and I know that the alumni network is amazing. It’s relatively easy to get internships in the city. There is an open curriculum and I am thinking pre-law, but I’m not sure, and I know this would benefit me immensely. It is all undergrad, meaning tons of opportunity for research and exploration, and even a 300 acre preserve and farm on campus for research opportunity. That said, costs are around 75,000 and I would have to pay about 63,000 per year, which includes a small subsidized loan of 3000. My family has said they would help me pay about 40,000 per year, but they would have to take out loans to do it. I feel like they would be able to pay about 2 years, but struggle with the other two. They’re not 100% open. The rest is on me. That’s about 92,000 in total for me if my financial appeal doesn’t come through. I don’t want to be a burden, but this is an amazing opportunity. I’ve also had an absolutely horrible experience in high school because my peers are mostly unmotivated and lazy, and I want to be in an institution that fosters creativity with people who love learning. I CANNOT settle for a school because high school was bad enough. 

That being said, I got a full ride to St Johns University, but I really hate that school because of the sheer amount of requirements in the curriculum. I’ll never explore anything. I would be paying 5000 for SUNY Stony Brook, it’s fine but huge and not ideal. I also got 32,500 in scholarship for Fordham, but Fordham is 72,000 anyway. The location for Fordham is a draw, as is the alumni network. But I would still have to take out loans and at that point, is it worth it if I choose Vassar instead? Also I’m in the honors program for Stony and St Johns.

I’m planning to get a job out of college to help me fund grad school. I’m thinking of law but am not certain. I want to be in the best position possible to be successful, and I know Vassar’s alumni and name can help. I’m just so stressed about the finances, and my family has expressed that they cannot pay unless I take out the loans in my name. I’m also trying to apply to scholarships, so I may get some money.

If I understand correctly, the major difference between unsubsidized student loan versus a personal loan is simply ""start pay now"" vs ""start pay once you are done with school"". Either way, it will still pile up  interest over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, it's better to start paying as soon as I can to reduce the amount of interest. On the other hand, it will be very difficult to pay monthly payment while being a full time student. I plan on getting a decent part time job, but I don;t know how successful I'll be with that in a foreign country. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is the only reason to go for unsubsidized student loan simply the ability to postpone payment?"
391,t3_g63kbj,StudentLoans,Variable Interest Rate Riskiness?,"I'm currently a student earning my Master's in Reading Education. I have four courses remaining, and due to the pandemic, I wanted to finish them up during the summer. However, I just realized today that I can't apply my 2020-2021 student loan offer to this summer. I currently have $30k in student loans from undergrad and grad school.

If I finish in the summer, I'll be able to earn my Master's pay this current school year ($74,616 from $67,813). If I finish in the fall, my new pay will be applied in the 2021-2022 school year. If I wait until the fall semester, I can get the federal loan interest rate in September. It'll just be more difficult while teaching than it will be during the summer. The summer courses are also shorter. 

The total cost is $9080. At the end of this school year, I am getting $1125 reimbursed from my school district, bringing the cost down to $7,995.

Because I have no financial aid options for the summer, I was looking at private loans. Sally Mae has an offer for a fixed rate loan for 5.750% with interest payments in the beginning and principle payments later. It's fixed rate option is 8.1250%.

I know that variable interest rates are often risky. How risky are they right now? I figure I'm also going to refinance all my loans once I'm all done. So is it that risky? Any other advice for means of acquiring the funds?

*Edit: I called the office of financial aid again and asked about increasing my borrowing limit as per u/horsebycommittee's advice. She directed me to a Summer Aid form from which the balance of the original amount offered to me would become available. Looks like the problem is solved as long as they approve it. Thanks!"

Since we are currently not obligated to make payments on our student loans, I recently attempted to make targeted payments only to the student loan with the highest interest rate. Cornerstone is my provider and during my first attempt I went through their online portal and entered my bank information. After a week or so, I noticed they never withdrew the money from my account. I followed up with them and they stated the bank information was inaccurate. This was the same bank information they have been automatically deducting payments from for years. During this call, I ask the Customer Service Rep to initiate they payments on their end. They requested my bank information and I relayed this information from a physical check that was right in front of me. The initial payment said processed and when I looked at my bank it was never withdrawn. Ultimately the funds were never withdrawn and I was unable to make the payment to the specific higher interest loan. 

I called them today to confirm why it didn't go through and they said the bank did not have any information with my account information. I immediately called my bank and they (1) confirmed the information I provided to Cornerstone was accurate and (2) that they never attempted to deduct the funds from account.

Has anyone had this issue? I want to use this time as an opportunity to pay down the higher interest loan but I can't help but think something shady is going on."

So I am not sure refinancing is the right move right now, but some of my loans are rocking a 8% interest rate. I have made a few larger payments recently to navient and I am confused on how they are allocating my payments. Sometimes it seems they are going to unpaid interest, sometime interest, sometimes principal amount. I attempted to pay off all the unpaid interest so I made over payments for the unpaid totals but checked today and those payments didnt all go to the interest so I am at a loss for what is going on.

Thankfully I can cover the full tuition and cost of living with just federal loans (unsubsidized and grad plus loans). I’m estimating to have 176K before the interst for this 3 years program.

Unfortunately, I did not get accepted into in-state program (the one I’m going is also in-state but private).

I know the debt will be high once I graduate and I’m definitely going to try to work for a non-profit hospital (for PSLF) or become a traveling PT (pays higher)to pay the loan as fast as possible. But every time I look at how much I will be in debt once I graduate is pretty scary and depressing.

413,t3_g5ky60,StudentLoans,Pre-planning for student loans. I really need help before signing away my soul.,"I'll be going to law school next year. I already work in law, so I know what I'm getting myself into as a career. I know it most likely won't make a lot of money, but it's something I actually enjoy and would like to make a career out of. It's where my passion lies...unfortunately, because if my passion was within engineering, money would be far less of a fear.  
That said, student loans. No matter what school I go to, I'll need to take some out if only to cover the living expenses. I've calculated around 80k for 3 years at a school where I have full tuition if I can't get any work during those 3 years, but employment rate upon graduation at that school is quite low. I have a few choices for schools, but I'm trying to figure out the feasibility of survival after taking out the loans.  
I've been trying to run the numbers, but I have no experience in budgeting or finance.  
I've run the numbers through some separate calculators, but I know the numbers can't be correct. Otherwise, everyone would be taking out loans as no big deal.  
Here's what I'm getting: If I take out $180,000 in loans over 3 years, then graduate with a job paying $60,000 (about the median amount attorneys make if you get rid of the outliers), then using [MIT's living wage calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06037) for Los Angeles, the cost of living would be 26,528, income tax based on [smartasset's calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) would be around 16000, and monthly loan payments based on [studentaid.gov's calculator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator) would be from 344-483/month if my income grows by 2% annually. This would, if assuming the $483 payment as a constant, theoretically leave me with around 11000/year left over to pocket. If 10% of wages should go into retirement savings, that still leaves 5k/year. It's been pointed out to me in /r/personalfinance that mit's living wage calculator is likely a gross underestimation of living expenses. According to the [census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/losangelescountycalifornia) website, the median income for LA is around 64k/year, though 14.2% of people live in poverty.  
All of my loans will be federal loans because I'm ""lucky"" enough to be broke enough to qualify for entirely federal to cover all expenses. But the 60k/year income is more of a median estimate, so there's a chance that I'd either make significantly less, or even be unable to find employment, or significantly more, around 180k/year (around 40% of graduates from that school made 180k/year in the first year's salary).  
A lot of this planning hinges on loan forgiveness after 20 years if I can't get a high paying job after graduation. Financial aid offices tout this as a viable option, but how viable is it really?  
No matter where I go, I'll end up with somewhere between 80k-180k in student loans, and the more loans I take out, the higher the probability of getting the job that will allow me to pay off those loans...but there's still a chance that no matter where I go, I won't get a job anywhere, and I'll still end up owing a lot of money. That's the double edge sword. A piece of me thinks ""80k debt with no job...well, what's the difference between 80k debt with no job and 180k debt with no job, that debt will still be impossible to pay off either way.""  
Financial aid offices at schools are very biased, as are the government websites that give you the loans in the first place, so I'd like as much information as possible about pre-budgeting, paying off student loans in the future, etc.  
I'm also aware of PSLF, and would like to keep that open as an option, but I know I can't depend on it because it could be taken away at any point."

418,t3_g54dln,StudentLoans,Federal Student Loans Repayment Schedule/Redisclosure Questions (general &amp; COVID Qs),"**Summary:**

1. Did my servicer calculate my repayment schedule wrong? Is it too late to do anything after 6 years? 
2. Will servicers redisclose the loans (recalibrate payment schedules) after COVID forbearance?
3. If I'm paid ahead slightly, and my loans are redisclosed, will my monthly payment go up or down? 

**Background**  
I finished grad school in 2014 with $16K in undergraduate debt and $121K in grad school debt (total $137K). This was a breakdown of my loans (including the uncapitalized accumulated interest):

|FFEL (3 loans cumulative)|$16,000 |
|:-|:-|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Subsidized|$8,500|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$15,023|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$14,200|
|Direct Unsubsidized|$22,600|
|Direct PLUS|$6,000|
|Direct PLUS|$11,200|
|Direct PLUS|$34,764|

I did not consolidate the loans. Extended Graduated Repayment worked best for my situation and I was given a 20 year repayment schedule (240 months). I know the FFEL loans were only eligible for 10 yr repayment.

After 17 payments, my servicer redisclosed my repayment schedule, and the repayment schedule was 240 months again.

I was recently reading that a borrower can have up to 25 years (300 months) for repayment under Extended Repayment. Was my $121K in Direct loans only enough for a 20 year repayment schedule? Is it too late to do anything at this point?

Through lots of hard work, I have knocked down my debt to about $80K.  Also, I am paid ahead by a 3-5 months on my remaining loans.  Does anyone know if after COVID forbearance, will the servicers be redisclosing the repayment schedule? If I'm paid ahead, will the payment go down slightly?"

I was recently admitted to my dream school, UC Santa Barbara, but I am not in good standing relationship with either of my parents and they are infuriated with my decision to go to a univeristy (they want me to work just like them, and not actually attend college), as well as the idea of taking out a loan to attend, despite the fact that I have gotten straight A's throughout high school. I am very scared that I wont be able to attend due to the fact that my parents will not cosign any sort of private loan that I would need in order to attend. I am currently very behind on many things, as I turned 18 a few months ago and do not even having a checking or credit account with the bank. Currently, I would need to take out $27,000 in loans for one year at this school, but I do not know how to do this without my parent's help, and they refuse to offer any advice or support which is why I have come here for help. My parents make above $80,000 combined so colleges wouldn't be lenient to reducing the tuition for me either. I really want to know what my options are and I hope someone here could help me figure things out. Of course I know I need to go to the bank ASAP and open a credit card up, but is it possible for me to easily take out $27,000 in loans without my parents to cosign? Any advice is greatly appreicated!

TL;DR -- Unsure how to take out $27,000 in student loans as an 18-year old with no parental help, despite the fact that I am still dependent on them. Google confused me on my options so I wondered if anyone here has a clue on what I could do in this situation. FAFSA said I qualified for about 5000 in federal loans.

EDIT: The school says I need to find 19k from private lenders and that I qualify for 8k from college/federal lenders. I can most likely live off campus to reduce this number by a few thousand, probably 3 or 4 thousand. I really am looking for a college experience and memories -- but am unsure if its worth the money.

I am in graduate school and I have a scholarship that turns into a federal student loan if I don’t work for the government for for four years as I originally planned.

I have a couple of questions. First what happens if I stay in the UK and only visit America. Can do US government come after me in the UK? Secondly I have  savings that I’ve been building up since I was 18(currently25) and I could just pay the debt off in cash if I wanted to, but does that make any sense if I’m moving to the UK permanently?

427,t3_g4y3wc,StudentLoans,Confused on what happens after nelnet 6 months no payments.,"I have nelnet and got No payments for 6 months. You will not have to make payments on your federally held student loans for six months (through September 30, 2020).

I'm trying to figure out a few financial moves (aka should I pay other higher interest loans during this time or keep paying into 0% nelnet loans that are forbearance until september)

BUT I cant seem to find any information on what happens after this 6 months is all over. Can someone tell me what I should expect? Which will happen?

1. September will require all 6 months payment at once for the non paid months (so $300x6 = payment of $1800)

2.  Entire loan payoff date gets extended by 6 months and payments stay normal

3. Loan payments are now higher for the rest of the loan term (6 months of payments divided by months left on loan added to each month)


Sorry if I missed this somewhere but this does matter for me to make some decisions."

Notes: 

* Cost of attendance would be close to 60K/year, **AFTER** factoring in financial aid. Unfortunately, the school is not providing a lot of assistance (a small ""scholarship"" and maxed-out federal student loans and work-study)
* We can probably afford 25-30K per year out-of-pocket. Looking at ways to finance the remainder

Looking at alternatives to PLUS loans. Any advice on seeking out private student loans? What to avoid?

Sallie Mae sounds like a fairly standard option, but I'm not sure if there are better options.

The loan would be in the child's name, with the parent's as cosigners. We have Very Good to Excellent credit, but the child (just turned 18) has no credit history. We intend to assist with paying off the loan, but the child would be responsible for taking over loan payments after graduation.

436,t3_g4w47y,StudentLoans,My bf had no idea he had any loans...thought his parents paid up front...6 loans in default for 3 +years..help,"So obviously my bf made some mistakes in his past. His parents also made several mistakes. Yes, we know this is bad but we need help.   


So, he has 6 student loans from what I can tell that all totaled around 10k ..all six went into default approximately 3  years ago. His parents never told him he had loans..much less that they were going to stop paying them ..so we have sifted through his credit report.    



From what I can tell all six were from department of Ed..in 2018 they were sold back to the federal government? They have all accrued interest and collections charges that bring the grand total now to over $15,000.    


After my research I have done I have decided he should call and ask about rehabilitation ...but I have questions... 


What if he isn’t eligible and the 7yr mark resets on all because he contacted them? Will he immediately have to pay all 15k?   



If he does loan rehab will the interest and collections fees have the option to be waived? He didn’t even get his degree and it is so heartbreaking to pay 5,000 in interest when he is already paying 10k for absolutely nothing.   


If he is able to do rehab will it bring all loans out of default after the ten months of payments?    


His credit is 490 or so...I know it’s going to continue dropping...does this mean that he will always have bad credit?   



My head is spinning. I have student loans too but I got my bachelors and only have 5k in debt that I have been paying on since graduation .   


I am so worried that he is forever screwed. I know it’s not all on his parents but truthfully I completely believe him that his parents never told him anything. He suffered a brain injury as a child and therefore his parents neglect to tell him things about the real world sometimes due to either thinking he’s too stupid to understand or thinking he shouldn’t have to worry about this stuff since they paid for their other children to go to school. I can see on the credit report that his mother paid payments on 3 of the 6 loans for about 2 years before suddenly defaulting on all of them.   


Is rehab the best option? Someone help"
437,t3_g500mb,StudentLoans,Alternatives to Parent PLUS Loans?,"I'm currently a freshman in college. Because I was a kid (and frankly, I still am), my mother insisted she'd cosign on a Parent PLUS loan with me because she didn't think I could find any lender. However, she made it clear that she was not paying for any of it and that I would have to assume it all under my name upon graduation. 

This said, I have a better understanding of my loans and do NOT want to keep relying on the PLUS loans. The interest is exorbitant. Without having any credit to my name, how do I find a better alternative? I'm expected to pay for all of my debt myself without any family help. I know how unreliable Sallie Mae is. I guess my only option is to take out a private loan, though, but don't know where to start looking, and I have no idea where to look for scholarships. 

If I can't avoid the PLUS loans I think I'll consider dropping out of college, but I want that to be a last resort.

440,t3_g4w6kl,StudentLoans,Need advice for next steps,"25 years old, 4th year out of college and finally in a good place financially to really get the ball rolling on my student loans (\~33k).  I've only been making the minimum payments using an IDR which hasn't done much in bringing down principal/interest. Currently in a REPAYE plan. Over the last year and half, my main focus was creating an emergency fund. Since I was only making minimum payments, I didn't put my extra funds towards student loans. Honestly, my financial situation my first 2 years out of college was very hard (IDR min payment $0 to student loans during then) and psychologically I just needed to see my checking account balance go up which I know probably didn't do me any favors for repayment. Hoping to fix all of that. 

I have 2 loan servicers, one through my university and other though Great Lakes.  The loan through my school isn't in forbearance from COVID but everything else is. I listed out my loans below:

School: 

* $4,400 (5%)

Federal: 

* Sub $5,600 (4.29%)
* Unsub $2,200 (4.29%)
* Sub $5,600 (4.66%)
* Unsub $2,400 (4.66%)
* Sub $4,600 (3.86%)
* Unsub $2,400 (3.86%)
* Sub $3,600 (3.40%)
* Unsub $2,900 (6.8%)

I have the ability to payoff up to 6/7k but not sure where to put that first. Should I just pay off my $4,400 school loan since the interest isn't at 0% right now? Or should I pay off the unsub $2,900 (6.8%)? I also have just under $600 in unpaid interest, so should that be the first thing I pay off? If I put anything towards the federal loans, should I just hold off until September when everything restarts? I've been reading about the snowball or avalanche methods, but I still get very lost in what would best work for me. AGI is about 46k/year. Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!"
441,t3_g4qj2d,StudentLoans,I think an acquaintance of mine just got scammed,"I was casually having a conversation with an acquaintance of mine and we got into the topic of student loans. I was telling him my repayment strategy when he said he got his wiped. He went on telling me about how ""there's a loophole"" and that an old classmate of his that ""works for the government"" helps people with this kind of stuff as a side hustle. 

He said he charged him $2000 with a promise that he can wipe out his SLs from all 3 of the major credit bureaus by claiming that they are fraudulent. He went on to explain that since these private servicing companies like Navient, Sallie Mae, FedLoans, ""bought"" your loans from the government...that you're not entitled to pay them at all. His logic is that the promissory note you signed when you signed with FAFSA doesn't obligate you to pay these private parties because they would'nt be able to produce that promissory note if any of the bureuas decided to do an audit. He said his friend has a 6 month guarantee or your money back so he's not worried. He started the process back in February and he said he started seeing accounts being labeled as ""closed"" on his FedLoan account as early as March as well as those accounts being labeled as closed on his Experian account. He even showed me screenshots of it which I'm wary of.

He sent me his friend's info and I checked it out. It's a consulting agency website full of screenshots of happy customers and their credit karma/Experian dashboards with improving credit scores. He doesnt just do this with SLs. He also provides services related to credit card debt, mortgage debt, and more. I checked out his Instagram and it was only created back in November 2019.

I was obviously suspicious so I dug up my old promissory notes and looked for where it mentions anything about paying through a servicer....and it's everywhere. I also checked out Studentaid.gov and found a section saying:

""In some cases, we need to transfer loans from one servicer to another servicer. **If we transfer your federal student loans from one servicer to another servicer, your loans will still be owned by ED. The “transfer” to another servicer simply means that a new servicer will provide the support you need to fully repay your loans.** "" [Source](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/servicers#understanding-loan-transfers)

First off, loans are awful especially if I am planning to take on 200k to attend Northeastern. While it is a good college, I'm sure most people will say the reputation isn't worth it. And especially because I am studying computer science, the major itself will land me a stable or decent job out of college.  Despite knowing all this, my mind can't seem to let go of NEU. I've been debating on 33k a year for UMass or Northeastern 56k before any aid. 

Northeastern I've heard that CS majors handle the debt well due to their Co-op programs paying 20 to 35 dollars an hour for a 6 month period. The school itself is in a great location and its very easy to make connections. 

So basically in the end, I am asking if 56k a year debt for (except my first semester my parents will pay for) a better reputation school and potential for 3 internships is reasonable than a 33k year debt (which my parents can probably push for paying the whole year) for a very good reputation school of UMass"

The term confusing me is “latest term.” Does this mean that I don’t put it down for all of the semesters that I need the loan for (meaning covering all four years)? If I need the loan for fall and spring up until 2024, do I put May 2024, or May 2021 (as in the end of my first complete year of college)? 

Unrelated, but also, when asking the loan amount, do I request for all four years of college, or do I reapply every year?

446,t3_g4qaji,StudentLoans,Repayment and refinancing: What's the best option for repaying private loans ($20k and $6.8k)?,"I've posted on here before, and I have somewhat good news! My student loan debt got cut because my uni accepted my income appeal! I have about $43k in student loan debt now and $13k of that is in a savings fund. I want to save a bit of it as an emergency fund in case I lose my current bad paying job (my manager said it's very on the rocks due to shutdowns; I would only make about $30k a year and even that isn't locked in). I am trying to find a better paying job before just getting two jobs, but a lot of the positions I've applied for have been canceled because of the pandemic. What would be the best way to cut my debt and pay it off fast?

&amp;#x200B;

I have read a lot about refinancing, so I'm thinking of paying off a big chunk of the $13k toward my biggest private student loan ($20k), but the thing is that I don't know whether to do that or just pay off the $6.8k private loan completely first. The rest of my debt is in federal student loans, so I'm not too concerned with it.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, can you refinance one private student loan? The $6.8k one has 11.5% interest and the $20k one has 10.8% interest (thanks discover), so I'm not sure what the best option is here. I have an above-average credit score so I want to try to refinance right when I graduate. I've researched it, but it seems most companies are interested in consolidating multiple loans.

Apparently a few single moms with children have had their federal student loans forgiven?

448,t3_g4uf70,StudentLoans,403b changes in the CARES act,"Hey all 

Was looking for some advice on a couple of scenarios. Me and my wife hold about 60k in private student loans. We also Federal loans and we are both on the PSLF track. 

Given that our loans have varying interest rates I was going to try and consolidate our loans to the lowest fixed rate I could find (for reference all of our loans have about 13 years left in the term). I just received an email from my job detailing some of the changes in the cares act. 

From what I understand I could withdraw up to 100k and the pre withdrawal penalty would be waived bit I would still need to pay income taxes. I also could spread those taxes over 3 years. 

For some background me and my wife’s jobs are pretty secure and are very unlikely to be affected. So here are my options (assuming I qualified)

Option 1 : consolidate my loans and my wife’s loans into two separate loans (one for each of us) with the lowest fixed rate I can get at the same or similar payment term. Will continue to pay the same monthly amount as I am currently so any savings would lead to a sooner payoff

Option 2 : withdraw the money needed to payoff the loans in full. Likely spread the income tax payments over 3 years. My primary retirement account currently sits at about 130k and this will be a big hit. Will take the money saved from paying off and focus on maxing out both of our 403b plans to recoup losses

Option 3: consolidate now while interest rates are low. Wait to see if the market improves before the end of the year (these rules are in effect until Dec 2020). With an improved market my plan will likely have recouped some losses and I could withdraw then. 

Thanks in advance for the advice"
449,t3_g4y86k,StudentLoans,Student Loan Forbearance May Impact Credit Reporting?,"I contacted Great Lakes to ask about how forbearance impacts credit reporting. I heard that other types of loans, such as mortgages, when placed in forbearance will be reported as such on a credit report; lenders may look at forbearance negatively, even if there is no delinquency or missed payment reported. I asked if that would also happen with student loan forbearance and if participating in forbearance could impact my credit and/or ability to qualify for a mortgage in the future.

Great Lakes responded:

""Each credit bureau has its own unique method and product for determining credit scores. Because their products are proprietary, we are uncertain what exact credit values are used and how they are weighed. We do know that maintaining a sound payment history and successfully managing your account so that late payments don’t occur is a benefit for credit scoring.

Our office reports a number of data pieces on your account, the current status, the loan open date, high credit (total disbursed amount minus refunds), payoff amount, which includes late charges and all accrued interest, and the amount and date of your last payment. We also report the type of loan, and your obligation towards the loan.

For your convenience, we have included a list of the credit bureaus. Their customer service staff may be able to discuss how your student loan impacts your credit score.""

I called Great Lakes and asked to have the forbearance removed from my account and the officer said to ""give it some time."" When I asked how long, they said it would usually take 3-5 business days, but a lot of people are asking to be taken out of forbearance right now so it could take longer. My payments were formerly due on the 23rd, so I asked if I should go ahead and make a payment before then since the process may not be complete by then. The officer said I probably should so that my account wouldn't be past due.

I called TransUnion and they said it would not impact my score, but forbearance would be reported. They said it's up to the lender how they want to interpret forbearance and that ""hopefully"" lenders would be understanding since forbearance was automatic.

I know this is a whole new process for everyone, but it worries me that companies don't seem to have the details worked out. I've paid more than my monthly payment for the life of my student loan and am on track to pay it off years early. I had planned on saving my payments for then next 6 months, then making a large payment in September. That's the advice I've seen here, on other subreddits, and heard from other people. I would hate to have difficulty borrowing money for a house one day because I was automatically placed in forbearance and didn't make payments when I could have. Just wanted to give others a heads up and see if anyone else has heard anything different."

I'm partaking in the PSLF program, so after 120 payments, they get discharged. I have no faith this program will make it through the next presidential cycle so would like to pay something towards them despite all the payments being on forbearance. I would still like to contribute the amount I'm usually paying per month to my debt and this amount could pay off four smaller loans by the time the forbearance is lifted. I don't know how much interest this would save me over the years, however. Nor do I know if this is the best option for lowering my burden. Would it be better to put this monthly payment to the accumulated interest, the smaller loans to pay them off and get them off the account, or just to a bigger loan? Or something else that I'm failing to see?

So my school's requested me to submit a verification of non-filing letter from the IRS to confirm that I am indeed as poor as I say I am. I've been trying for the past few months now to obtain this letter through the mail as I didn't expect it to take so long for them to send it to me (I requested it back in mid- to late January and it never arrived + tried requesting it again in February). I've heard most people have to end up going to a local IRS office in order to have the necessary form printed out for them. However, in response to the current crisis all offices have been closed until further notice. 

I tried to make an account in order to obtain it online, but it seems that they are unable to match my student loan account number to verify my identity.  I've never filed taxes and didn't work during the year for which the verification of non filing letter is being requested (2018).

Does anyone have advice for what I can do or been in a similar situation that they eventually resolved? Any input would be greatly appreciated :)"
454,t3_g3zsyv,StudentLoans,I finally convinced my husband to let us live off one salary to pay off our student loans!,That’s really all. I am just excited. I put together a budget to prove to him that we can easily live off his salary (he makes way more than I do) and use mine (I’m a teacher) to pay off loans. I am just excited. I hope to one day be one of those who post that I paid off my loans. Let’s do this.
455,t3_g4izw3,StudentLoans,How should I finance my college education?,"I’m an 18 year old temporarily living with a relative because I was recently homeless. I’m not going to be able to continue living with them after I graduate HS because they are moving out of state. I applied to a lot of In state schools and with financial aid (just aids and scholarships) it comes out to about 16k a year across all of the schools. the option with the federal loans included would leave me at 7.5k a year to cover out of pocket as well. 

I know it’s difficult to say in my position, but I don’t want to deal with loans/ debt. I was homeless once and I don’t want to be homeless again. I’m planning on studying economics and becoming an actuary, which is a well paying job, but from my experience I know nothing is guaranteed and I need to plan for worst case scenarios. Is there any advice you can offer me to find safe and secure ways to lower or pay for this cost? 

My parents cannot contribute to my education at all. I haven’t asked other relatives yet, but I’m not sure if they would be able to help with the costs either. I do plan on having a job while I am in college, but I also do not want to work more than 25 hours a week so I can focus on my studies. Any type of advice would be greatly appreciated."
456,t3_g4g4sd,StudentLoans,Student loan monster,"Hey guys. I'm new to the sub and joined looking to see if anyone had insight on how to deal with this monster amount of student loans I've accumulated and/or how you manage the anxiety that comes with it.

I grew up in poverty and really didn't have a clear idea of what was normal or not finance-wise. When I applied to University and got in, my family was over the moon as I'd be the first to attend. We didn't know what we were doing, we just knew that if I went to school I'd make a lot of money someday, and be able to pay off whatever we borrowed. We were very ignorant.

I had to borrow every penny to attend school and worked part time jobs the entire time to afford food and gas money. I had scholarships and grants, but they didn't help much.

I was told that going to a state school wouldn't be as good and that I was guaranteed to make more coming from a private University. I know now that that was a load of shit. 

Now I am $126,000 in debt. I emerged with bachelor's and master's degrees in Speech Language Pathology and have a good job now that I've graduated and gotten out of school. My current job gets me ~46k before taxes with benefits, and working on the school year schedule. My first year of work is considered a fellowship year and has reduced pay. My husband is in the process of gaining his master's and is anticipating a starting 70k/year. He will come out with another ~42k in loans.

We are already far beyond where my family is and how I grew up, but I'm worried about paying off these loans and ending up where I started. Anytime I think about repayment I freak out. I see so many people struggling to pay off loans of 20-40k and that terrifies me because mine is 4x greater.

My base student loan bill will be $1,300/month. We might be able to get it down to ~800/month through income based repayment. I know this is possible, but I just don't know how to approach this.


TLDR: Grew up poor and didn't understand money. Ended up with a Master's degree and 126k in debt. Trying to find a smart way to handle the debt and the stress/anxiety associated with it all."
457,t3_g43ngw,StudentLoans,54K Private Debt DONE! +++Plus+++ 3 Legged Cat Tax (Included: How not to kill yourself in this process),"**CELEBRATION!**

&amp;nbsp;

***AND FOR YOUR PLEASURE:*  --HOW NOT TO KILL YOURSELF--** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Cat tax 1:**  (scroll down to bottom for 2nd cat tax)  https://imgur.com/6Ya4Y6i

&amp;nbsp; 

**Private DEBT:**  **54,000 thousand** -Starting at 10% interest ending in 13% interest 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2011:**  

* Graduated in 2011 from a private-for profit college.   I was working 100 hour weeks between graduation, a full time job, and an internship. 

*  Broke up with alcoholic boyfriend.   Lapsed into a monotonous depression.   Did not pay my student loans at all this year.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2012:** 

* Bought an ipad.   Used lots of forbearance. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2013:** 

* Ran out of money via reduced hours in the winter.   Cried in the bathroom because I didn’t have enough money to replace my uniform that went missing.  Didn’t have enough money for food.   Asked reddit about food banks and someone send me over 100 dollars for food.  (Thank you!)  

* Listened to the book “Total Money Makeover” by Dave Ramsey.   Something clicked, I got hope, never looked back.  Saved up for 1,000 emergency fund.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2014:**  

* Paid off 3,000 worth of credit card debt with my tax refund.  Worked all available overtime. 

* Income 31k to 34k 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2015:**
  
* Car broke down, needed emergency repairs.   
* Changed jobs after getting passed up 3x for a promotion.    Now a supervisor. Worked all available overtime.  34k to 37k

&amp;nbsp; 

**2016:**   

* Chipped and lost tooth.   3k worth of dental bills, 1.5k not covered by insurance.  Chipped another tooth and needed a root canal.   Insurance maxed out.  2.5k worth of dental bills.
* Working a 2nd job part time but had to quit because it was too draining. 
* Sober ex got back into my life and then started drinking again.  Broke into my house. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2017**

* Another junker broke down.  Emergency fund again depleted.   
* Did not get the promotion I wanted.  Contemplated suicide.  I thought about suicide a lot, but this was my only real time I felt like I needed to do it.   The urge was sudden, out of nowhere, and very powerful.  The pull to do it was intense.  I had access to the roof and all I had to do was jump off.    Starting calling the hotline.  Have called it once a year since probably.  They will totally talk to you even if you're not suicidal.   Any crisis where I feel overwhelmed, I will call.  
* Rejected by many loan refinancing companies. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**2018:** 

* More emergency car repairs.  
* Got promoted to manager of another department.  The job was incredibly toxic.  I regret taking that job until this day.   Started getting anxiety attacks on the regular.   Income 37k to 39k.  
* Got rejected by many loan refinancing companies.  
* Discovered minimalism by watching “Minimalism” and got rid of and sold 50% of my belongings 
* Sold my entire video game collection, my gaming systems, my manga, my bike, and anything else of significant value for extra money.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**2019:**
   
* Switched departments.   Back to a department that was monotonous.  New boss is very unprofessional, hard to talk to, and she gives me terrible hours and little help to do my job.    
* Both of my cats got bitten and severally infected.  I thought I was going to be the first person in my city to die of rabies (we did not have rabies.)  Had a nervous breakdown.     One cat recovered with antibiotics.  Other cat lost a leg.  Accidentally took cat to the most expensive animal hospital, 6,000 bill and amputation.   Added to debt snowball and paid off 6k bill. 
* Got approved by Lendkey.   13% rate down to 6.25 interest rate for remaining 17k loan.   Freaking finally
* Took a pay cut to get out of the hospitality industry and protect my mental health.  40k to 37k.   Started working in the medical field.  New boss is both fake and crazy.   My job was essentially trying to force old and disabled people to use a small ipad against their will.   Got fired for the first time in my life.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2020:**  

* Got rehired in hospitality management in late 2019.  Working crazy overtime.   37k bumped to 48k.    
* Started throwing money at my debt at an unprecedented rate.  
* Missed my final payment due to getting furloughed.
* Just got unemployment and stimulus check.   Hahaha, lets do this.  (Don’t worry, I still have 2k in reserve!) 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Things that helped:**

* Switching jobs when you can’t get promoted
* My emergency fund saved my ass every year with junker car repairs. 
* Eating out only a few times a year and on special occasions 
* Following Dave Ramsey’s plan, starting with the lowest debt and working towards the highest debt.  
* Selling everything, sacrificing everything to win  
* Getting into minimalism and seeing how little I need to own because I don't use the things I have. 
* Making enough money to get approved for refinancing 
* Not dating anyone.   Going out= spending $$$ 
* Libraries!  Coffee shops!  MY FREAKING GOD I LOVE THE LIBRARY 
* Holy s---, between paying off all my care credit dentist bills, credit cards, vet bills, and private student loans, my credit score is f---ing amazing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Things I struggled with**

* Getting started.  My very first “extra” payment was 30 dollars and I remember how awful it felt because the entire thing went to interest and didn’t hit the principle at all.   That was sad.  Getting started when your debt is so high and your interest is so high, it’s feels impossible to make a dent at first. 
* Not seeing my family very often, out of state
* My mental health.  I decided paying off my private debt was worth my life (in the good and bad sense.)
* Every emergency was another gut punch, another setback even if I could pay for it.   
* Income going up slowly instead of quickly.  Feeling like other people are making more money than you while reminding yourself many people make less than you. 
* The never ending monotony.   Staying home day after day after day after day.    It’s like walking in the desert for six years.  You know there’s water in 6 years, but you’re thirsty, and tired, but if you keep walking… every day, every day, for six years…. It will be over.  It will be over, I just need to put my one foot in front of the other.  This is miserable.  But can I keep doing it?  Yes.  One more step.  And now another.  Yes, keep going.  (Repeat thousands of days)

&amp;nbsp; 

**Borrowers Defense:**  Filed in 2018, still pending.  F--- that school (it’s closed and they got sued by a lot of people.)  

**PAYE:**     I pay the minimum for the next 14 years on the 20 year PAYE plan it will be around 38k total.  

**Tax Bomb:**  Around 16k.  I will save up 16k in the next 2 years as an emergency fund/ tax bomb coverage. 

**If I try and pay it off:**    75k+ interest of trying to pay that back over 5 years= over 85k!

I have not been a huge earner.  You CAN do this making 30k + overtime or a second job.  You can switch jobs and make more.   There is nothing fun or easy about being on the grind, because that's exactly what it feels like.  But you CAN do it.    All it takes is time, hard work and being willing to be completely and utterly bored on a day to day basis.  Not getting derailed when emergencies happen (because they will happen) is essential.

461,t3_g48jc5,StudentLoans,Advice for paying off loans in light of CARES Act?,"Hi all,

So far I’ve taken $110k of debt down to $49.5. I have another $5k I can pay it down with. Around $24k is at 6.3% and the rest is 6.55%. I’ve been paying down the 6.55d quicker. But now under the CARES Act, interest on the 6.55s is 0 until September 30th. 6.3s are Federal loans but of a type that aren’t changed by the act so continue to accrue interest. 

So far job is steady though like everything else right now, no guarantee. Do have a significant emergency fund (more than they typically advise be put aside)

What is my best option for now:

1.  Pay down the 6.55s now since more will go to principal

2. Pay down the 6.3s even though the rate is lower

3. Put the amounts in high yield (1.9%) savings in case I ultimately need the cash then pay down the 6.55s shortly before September 30

Thoughts?


Thanks"

464,t3_g4ae21,StudentLoans,Refinancing Options,"Hey guys! I need some assistance with refinancing my student loans. I'm set to graduate college in May with a Marketing degree, and I have a job lined up that will pay 45k per year with up to 10k in bonuses per year. I have 65k in loans over the 5 years I was in school. 38k is private through Sallie Mae and College Ave. 27k is federal. I've read that I should consider keeping my federal loans where they are at, but I need to refinance my private ones ASAP. My SM rates are between 7.25% and 11.75%. Obviously there's a lot of room for improvement there. 

My biggest thing is that I want to lower my interest rate and not pay a ridiculously high amount every month right out of college. For some strange reason, I'm kind of okay with potentially a 15+ year repayment option, and increase my payment amount as my salary grows. My reasoning for this is because my car is kind of starting to show its age, and I want something newer/more fun to drive since I'll have a long commute to work every day. Not a necessity by any means, but just something fun for me that I've wanted to do for a while. 

Where should I look to refinance to get the best long term rates possible? Of course I'll be shopping rates at a few places, but I need to get away from my private companies and get a better rate. Any advice is welcome!"

466,t3_g4dmhz,StudentLoans,"Just had an idea that could reduce my federal student loan interest rate, thoughts?","I have a significant amount of student loans from undergrad and then straight to 5 year grad program and barely made payments on them. I would say on average the interest rate from all loans is 6.8%

I have a savings account with Ally that pays 1.5% APR , a credit card that offers unlimited 2% cash back on all bill pays/transactions. If I put for example about 6 months worth of minimum payments lump sum in the savings account, used the credit card to pay my minimum payment loan gaining 2% CB, then paying the credit card right away from savings account which gained that 1.5% interest on the amount, would I be technically dropping my loan interest from 6.8% to 3.3%. all this of course would be setup with auto pay automatically (which actually lowers my interest rate by 0.25%). So final interest rate would be basically 3.05% without losing the benefits of having a federal loan if times get tough instead of refinancing with a private lender.

Hey guys, I have been periodically posting my updates over the last year.

Last May I graduated with a masters degree and $55,000 in student loans and I have spent the last year aggressively repaying them back.

Though I have been paying back a regular $3,000/month like clockwork, my recent tax returns, reimbursed PTO, and my covid check have allowed me to recently deposit a few lump sum payments totaling $12,000.

In total, over the last 11 months I have paid back over $42,000 and I am currently just $14,000 in debt.

I am expecting an amended tax return of another $2,000, so that really just leaves $12,000 for me to take care of. At my current pace ($3,000/month), I expect to pay this off by August of 2020, which coincides with my 24th birthday.

Y'all, I'm friggin pumped. Student loans have been the only thing on my mind since I began college in 2014...

I am currently coming in to my “last year”  of engineering at my college. I want to quit my job, and really knock this thing out of the park GPA wise. However, I have always had to work a second job to supplement my student loans; and be able to live. As the government usually only leaves me with around 1000-1500 for the remainder of the semester after books are paid for. 

I was curious if anyone had experience taking government loans out for college, and then an additional “micro” private “student-loan” for living expenses? Such as like 10,000 for the year. I would like to emphasize “student loan” not a personal loan.

476,t3_g3yo4a,StudentLoans,Advice needed: I am overly obsessing about my loans,"I am obsessing about my student loans. I graduated with my Masters in Education in Counseling about 1.5 years ago. Despite my salary hoving around 40K (43K come September), I earn an additional max of $700 per month in working O/T (8 hours per week). I found out the hard way that working as a crisis phone counselor beyond 8 extra hours is beyond what I could handle; so 8 hrs is where it has remained. 

In 1.5 years I have already been able to throw 16K towards my debt bringing it to a total of 37K. The freeze on my interest rates (5.45%) and the forbearance is going to save me about 1K in interest over this six-month period. In which time I may be able to drop an 8K bomb on my loans come September by saving my typical monthly payment of $650 along with keeping up with the O/T work pace. 

I am going with the avalanche method as 3/4 of my smaller loans are sitting at 5.75% interest and my biggest (17K) is sitting at 4.75% interest. I even plan on using my upcoming raise in September to put an additional $100 per month towards my monthly loans bringing it up from $650 to $750. I have remained fairly disciplined with my budgeting and have decreased/eliminated poor habits like drinking or smoking which has saved me quite a bit. 

Aggressively, if I keep up this pace I could annihilate my loans in 2-3 more years. Conservatively, if I ease up on the aggression after this temporary student loan freeze, I am looking more at 4 more years. Though this does not take into account that I would hopefully be earning more in that time frame as well. But, I have no way of calculating how much that could be in my field. My LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor)  is now secured which opens up options for jobs I actually want with (hopefully) better pay. Yet this pandemic as thrown a huge wrench into that plan. In which case I am lucky and thankful to still be employed. 

Despite all this planning, I find myself on a nearly daily basis rewriting my budget, rewriting my student loan payment plan or reading article after article about finding more ways to save. Or hoping I'll come across a news article that confirms additional coronavirus financial assistance or that the Democrats plan to forgive 10-30K in loans is picking up traction (though I know this will not happen). 

This does not at all feel healthy to me anymore as I feel like I am circling the wagons rather than trusting that I am already doing all that I can. Can anyone relate to this? Any advice? Tips? Words of wisdom?"

I'm new this process and I wanted to get some advice on taking out private student loans (recommendations, things you wish you knew). I am currently nearing the end of my first year at an out-of-state university, so tuition is quite high (basically 45k a year). My parents have paid for the first year but they cannot afford to anymore. They are willing to be co-sponsors of any loan I take but they do not want to take out the Parent PLUS loans because then the responsibility falls on the parent to pay it off.

I am planning to graduate in three years so I have to borrow for the next two years. I will be graduating with a computer science degree from a good public school so hopefully I will be able to have a steady income after graduation to pay off whatever debt I do rack up. I estimate around 80k-90k in private student loans after counting housing &amp; living costs, depending on how much I am able to work and what kinds of jobs I find for the summers.

Some questions I have are quite trivial like do I have to take out all my students loans for a year at once? My school offers a monthly payment option for each year so is it possible to take out 9 individual loans instead? I know different companies offer different flexibilities in repayment options but is there anything that I should keep my eye out for because of my situation? Any help is appreciated! Thank you!"

* &lt;$5,000 in subsidized government student loans from undergrad

What would be the best approach in applying for loans? Should I request a government graduate loan to cover both my classes and housing or go with a personal loan, or even have multiple loans?

I posted previously about being debt free (about $50,000), but my husband also had a little over $60,000 in student loans. He’s been graduated since 2017, but he didn’t make much progress on them considering his $35-40,000 salary, so it was about $55k when I graduated and actually started working in October 2019. 

Definitely made a lot of sacrifices along the way - most of my peers live in luxury apartments with expensive cars and take lavish vacations, etc., but I still drive my $5k piece of shit and live in a tiny 700 sqft box and pretty much threw every possible dollar at the loans, and it’s paid off (literally)! Can’t even express how relieved I am. I know I’m fortunate to make a relatively high salary, so I know most people don’t have the luxury of paying their loans off so quickly despite an even stronger work ethic, so I really am grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given.

490,t3_g3u4zi,StudentLoans,So what does this CARES Act mean?,"I found this in my student loan inbox last night, from earlier this month.  There's no bill for later this month either.  I would like to continue paying my normal loan amount this month, but there's no bill for it.  Does this mean I shouldn't pay anything until I'm billing, probably after Sept 2020?  My loan is supposed to be forgiven next year.  Not paying means that potentially put back another six months.  I already got screwed over and had six payments not count, so the forgiveness date is six months behind what it's supposed to do.  I would like to continue normal payments.  I would NOT like to make payments and then be told, ""Oh, those payments don't count.  Whoever told you that was wrong,"" by the Public Service Loan Forgiveness tallying people.  That's what happened with previous payments when they tallied it up after the five year mark.  At least I've got something official in writing here.  






On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your federally owned loans that we service for ED.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.
In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program loans. If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:
●
0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.
●
Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.
Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.
Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends."

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I want to say that I completely empathize with you guys. I'm in default myself and it sucks.

I see a lot of people posting this little blurb from the DOS website about how no country has a treaty with the US for the reciprocal enforcement of judgements. Right, there isn't a treaty. But that doesn't mean countries don't have mechanisms in place for enforcing foreign judgments. They all do and it works on the principle of reciprocity. If the foreign country has a history of enforcing the host countries' judgements, the host country in turn will enforce the foreign countries' judgements. The US has established reciprocity with almost every country in the world. This includes China. You can be sued here in the United States and that judgement can be brought to almost any country in the world and they will enforce it. Whether they will or not .. I'll get to that in a minute.

The bit about excessive money judgements ... that's about punitive damages. That has nothing to do with us. We owe money and it can proven that we are 100% liable for the money we owe.

On Statute of Limitations and Serving Papers. If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars on your head, they're going to sue you. And you don't have to be around for it either. Serving papers Is for the defendant's benefit. It's so the defendant can know about the lawsuit and have a chance to defend themselves. The plaintiff just has to try their best to find the defendant. If they do that, the judge will let them enter a motion for default judgement and grant it. ""Ah, but now the clock starts ticking"" No. The clock does not tick when you are hiding. This is true for the SOL on the time to bring suit and the SOL to enforce the judgement. You can't hide for 6 or whatever number of years and go ""AHA, you couldn't find me. Time's up"" So this leaving the country deal means that this problem will never go away.

If they can find you (and that's not hard these days) and the amount of money that they would spend to domesticate the judgement is less than the amount of money they would get from you, they will bring the judgement to your new country and have it enforced. There isn't anywhere you could really go to build up assets and be safe. Hate to say it.

Someones probably going to say like ""Well, I've never heard of this happening"" or ""This doesn't happen very often"". You've never heard of it because you aren't in a position to hear about it. These things are locked away in the civil court records of the local governments of these foreign countries. And you can't really know how often it happens without looking. What you've heard (or haven't heard) from people on reddit or google searches .. that's not a good sample. If anything, it's an echo chamber.

Is it totally pointless to go abroad? It does help you avoid AWG and Im sure you'd be fine for many, many years. But these loan balances are going to be huge in 10-20 years. People are going to have half a million, million dollar bounties on their heads. If you've built up assets, why wouldn't they come after you???"

Earlier this morning I had a missed call/ voicemail from a human person addressing me by my full name. However she said she was looking to reach a woman with my last name and had me listed as a contact for her. I have sisters but I had never heard of this person. Do these people seek out others sharing last names and and call them just in case they know each other? Is it possible a rando put me down as a contact? Or is it neither and [redacted] doesn’t exist and it’s a convoluted layer to a scam

I just thought it was such a bizarre call, I’ve heard of the trouble Navient has gone through and googling the number yields robocall results but i was just so perplexed I had to ask a community that would be more knowledgeable"

Though it **pained** me to turn to private lenders, I knew that I could pay off the amount before P&amp;I kicked in. Unfortunately, they got one P&amp;I payment out of me - but no more!

Due to the world basically closing down and my lifestyle being drastically minimized thanks to work-from-home, I've been able to save like crazy the past two months to pay off the rest of my private loan. The dark cloud of Sallie Mae is gone!

Is this an okay amount to borrow for undergrad?

I also plan on working in the summers between my school years and saving all of that money to put forth a lump some payment of around 13 to 15k on the loans when I first get out of school, paying off all of the unsubsidized and a little of of the subsidized loan.

524,t3_g2tdvl,StudentLoans,Should my wife consolidate her loans?,"Hi all, trying to check the pro's and con's on this option as I was reviewing the options through studentaid.gov's loan simulator.

Background context: I went to community college, graduated with no debt, worked all 2019, currently unemployed, my wife and I got married in 2019. 

My wife's situation: Currently working her second year as a teacher, makes about 60k a year, 182,000 Direct plus unsubsidized loans inherited from her parents, and about 23,000 in stafford loans, subsidized/unsubsidized. 


I believe she's on a standard repayment plan (not sure how/where to check this in nelnet and greatlakes website) as her student loans were deducting about half of her take home pay every month until deferment started. Through studentaid.gov, when we looked at consolidating her loans and trying to lower the monthly payments, one of the options it gave is for ""income-contingent repayment"" which indicates it would have a payoff date of March 2030, with 93k paid and 264k forgiven. All of the other options it gives us have significantly higher monthly payments after consolidation and payoff dates in 2045 and 2050. Is there a drawback to doing this?"

I'm *thinking* I should pursue refinancing all of the private loans at this time and take the money I'm stashing during the federal forbearance period and throw it at those. Then maybe a month or so after the forbearance ends, I can revisit possible refinancing the federal loans as well since that will be \~6 months after my first refinance. One gotcha is if I don't get a rate better than 4.25, then there's no sense in including the AES loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for different approaches to tackling all of this. While I'm still currently putting the minimums into this, I do plan on increasing that by starting out with $100 more a month and I *may* put all of the stimulus check towards it. Am I missing something here? Anything else to consider?"

533,t3_g2oewa,StudentLoans,0% Federal loan payment strategy question.,"TLDR on 10 year repayment plan, and started in November so basically 9.5 years left or so. So I have seen people say to not pay then do a lump sum payment at the end before interest starts back up. My question is which loan would be wiser to target. I pay $500 a month but had been paying an extra $100 towards a single low balance but high interest loan. There are two more loans with a larger balance and same high interest rate. For easy math and numbers let’s say 7% the lowest is 2,100 the second is 3,000 and the highest is 7,000. My thought is since I normally pay $600 a month, I should fully pay off the 3,000 loan. Over the 6 months and pay an extra $600 on the next smallest to get it gone faster. My thought is that it removes a loan completely and will never pay more interest on but lower the balance of the lowest one by the last $600 to start snowballing faster. Targeting the 7k would mean 3,4K left over and all 3 loans would have the same interest rate. I guess you could say I have one loan of 12,100 at 7% so does it even really matter?

Looking for some advice, I have a decent emergency fund built up and plan on paying the debt instead of keeping the savings."

Current job stinks, but they offer $10K/ year in student loan payments- after taxes it's about $6,300.  I have rec'd 2 payments over the last 2 years and am eligble for at least one more, possibly another 3 after that.  With these and ongoing payments, per my service provider, I can pay off in about 5 years.  

I rec'd an offer (lateral) which I think will be a better position, but no student loan payment benefit.

I am in the now defunct graduated repayment plan which has no cap re years.  Mohela said I do not qualify for the 25 year ceiling and would make payments through 2037 (!).  Im about 17 years in.

I have put in for PLSF and am awaiting a denial (graduated repayment plan does not qualify) so I can appeal under the tPLSF which was created in 2018.

536,t3_g2gmsm,StudentLoans,Is $125k too much to take out in loans?,"Let me know if this isn’t the right place to ask these kinds of questions!

I’m headed to law school in the fall and was accepted to two really great schools. The one that I want to attend more was going to cost me ~$65k in tuition and ~$60k in living expenses across the three years, so $125k in total. Coming out of law school, I would probably start out at $50k salary for the type of law I want to practice. The school has a LRAP to cover 100% of loans paid each for 10 years with a salary cap of $65k, and only allows for 1 year of a break (ie, maternity leave).

The debt scared me, a lot. I ended up depositing at a school that isn’t as exciting to me and will cost me &lt;$60k in living expenses only (free tuition scholarship). This school does not have a LRAP.

No one in my family has had to take out this much in loans before and so I feel pretty financially illiterate when it comes to loans. For both schools, I qualified for the max amount of Federal Direct ($20.5k) and for the ideal school, I would apply for Federal Grad Plus. From what I understand, they currently have interest rates of ~ 6% and 7%, respectively, but those are expected to decrease thanks to COVID. From the perspective of people who are working to pay of loans, do you think that debt ($125k plus interest) would be manageable? I don’t necessarily think I need assurance that I made the right choice, but like I said, I feel pretty financially illiterate and will have loans either way so I’m just trying to get a feel for reality of life with loans like this."
537,t3_g2l17q,StudentLoans,Student Loan Payoff Plan,"Hi all,

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on my student loan repayment plan as I am entering repayment in a couple months and would like to make sure that my payment plan minimizes interest payment.

A little background, I am a recent graduate who is currently only working part-time, however I am searching for full-time jobs (Although it's hard with current events). This should help boost my income and how much I can pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

My current loans are as follows:

|Loan|Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal Sub|3500|4.29%|
|Federal Sub|5500|3.76%|
|Federal Unsub|2500|3.76%|
|Federal Sub|5500|4.45%|
|Federal Sub|5500|5.05%|
|Perkins|2000|5.00%|

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to payoff the Perkins loan because it is through Heartland ECSI, and I have not heard a single good thing about them so I would like to get rid of this one as soon as possible.

After that, I plan on making minimum payments and paying extra towards the high interest loans. Once I have paid off up to the 4.29% loan, I plan on just making minimum payments on the 3.76% loans and saving more towards retirement. I am hoping to pay this off in around a year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Does my plan sound okay? Are there any other repayment options I should be considering?

If you have other Private loans whose interest rates are higher than your federal loans, **you should apply what would have been your minimum payments to your private loans** and let the federal loans sit where they are, until your payment in October comes due. 

Of course, if you are at risk of losing your job, hold onto the savings, or if you only have Federal Loans and can afford to still make payments, then dig into that Principle.

I'm pretty sure that when I did my first loan, I had to do a few things on the financial aid website, some kind of counseling and what not.

I recently submitted my required documents for summer semester.... And now I don't know/can't remember what to do next.

I emailed financial aid because I couldn't figure out how to submit my form. They never responded. I eventually figured it out myself.

I feel like I'm doing something terribly wrong and going to mess up my next semester lol.

What should I be doing?"
551,t3_g28ta5,StudentLoans,Future stimulus?,"My wife and I are down to about $40k in student loans, all federal, down from approx. $120k when we got married about 5 years ago.  She works a stable job that makes enough to support the family, and I'm currently between jobs but likely only briefly.

My question is: What do we think the odds of some type of student loan forgiveness being included in future rounds of stimulus are?  We have about $25k cash sitting in reserve at the moment (aside from retirement savings and a rental property that used to be our first home) and even with just her job the savings account is growing decently, as we're saving a lot on childcare with me not working along with the quarantine curbing our spending a good bit.  

I know that paying it off now is pointless, as it's all currently interest free for several months, but by the time interest gets reinstated we'll be close to being able to pay them off completely with our savings. What would you do if you were in our situation; pay them off and be done with them, or wait for a bit, see the lay of the land after the next few months and the next election, and see if a bit of stimulus can work in your favor before paying them down?"

I left law school with $171k (UG and Law) I have made consistent payments for nearly 6 years and now I owe $240k. Just wondering if down the road I can offer them $150k cash to settle it and be done. Otherwise I wait another 11-15 years and have them forgiven.
554,t3_g2g8wa,StudentLoans,Why you shouldn't use loan forgiveness,"So I explained in the Dave Ramsey subreddit why he is wrong about these programs. Wrong in execution not on if you should or not. Here is why and the real reason why these programs suck.

Example: 

You make 50k a year and your loan is 150k and you're on income based repayment. One of the plans is 20% of you discretionary income. So let's say after essentials are paid you have 1k left so 20% is 200/month. Now these aren't exact numbers but close enough.

Average student loan interest: 5.8%

Payment: $200

Per month interest: ~ $724

After 300 months, your loan will have a balance of 490k... So now that gets forgiven, great! You now have to pay 35% income tax on 499+50k which is around 192k. Yes someone making 50k even if you got a 2% raise every year is only 90k won't be able to afford that and guess what, the IRS will garnish your wages and social security. And the taxes on the forgiveness is more than your initial loan.

Moral of the story, find a way to pay down your loans!"
555,t3_g23tm2,StudentLoans,What is impact or options on student loans if my son takes a year off from school?,"My son is finishing his sophomore year of college and is talking about taking a year off to work and save up some money for continuing school after that year off.  I know the grace period before payments on those loans would start is 6 months, but are there any options available to further delay those payments if he is going back the following year?  I’m thinking no, but just wanted to put the question out there.

When he re-enrolls in school those payments would then stop and he’d be back into deferment status, correct?

Also when he uses up that grace period on his current loans it’s my understanding that when he graduates he won’t get another 6 month grace period on those loans, is that right?"

The total amount he owes after interest is $6k. He got them in 2003/04. Last year they garnished the tax refund, which we were not expecting---I'm assuming all those warning letters got sent to his old address and they didn't have his new address.

I've tried calling to talk to an agent, but with this COVID pandemic, there are decreased agents on call and higher call volume. So I'm turning to good ole' reddit for some advice.

What would the best course of action be? He is a firefighter, but I don't think would qualify for the student loan forgiveness since he defaulted...(but to my knowledge, that only kicks in after 10 years of on-time payments, which by then, I think the loan would have been paid off.) The debt has fallen off his credit report and we already have a home mortgage and do not have car notes.

Also, does the interest continue to accrue once the loan has defaulted? Or can we take our time with monthly payments?

I graduated with my bachelor's degree at the end of 2019. I have about $70,000 in private student loan debt through Sallie Mae (I know, I know, if I could go back in time I'd do a lot of things differently). I was recently accepted to graduate school and got offered about $10,000 per semester in financial aid. I'd only need about half of that to cover tuition, so would it be a bad idea to take the max amount and use the rest to pay off a chunk of the Sallie Mae debt? After about 2 years this would virtually convert 1/3 of my private debt to federal debt, which I feel would be great for lots of different reasons (e.g. better repayment plans and better chance of being federally discharged).

573,t3_g1v91j,StudentLoans,Refinance v Consolidate,"Hi all, my wife has about $115k in parent plus loan under her dad's name. Her parents aren't the most financially literate  and were gamed in to signing up for a bunch of those to finance her undergrad degree (didn't understand that she could take out loans herself, and refused to hear anything contrary to what they wanted to do). I'm not even sure if they realize that they are liable for those loans. She make about 60k currently a year out of school and we chose to sign up for the graduated 10 yr plan and pay approx $800/mo which will increase in 2021. We want to get those loans out from under her parents. One option is to refi and take advantage of her credit to lower the interest rate and be able to claim interest paid on our taxes (currently cannot even though we are paying them). The second option is to consolidate them federally under her name (again we'd likely get a better rate). My question is should we consolidate (potentially taking advantage of an income driven plan) under the assumption that something politically has got to give over the next few years and some amount of federal debt will be forgiven, or should we refinance and loose out on any federally held benefits? Between the two of us we make about $115k after tax (I would like to avoid cosigning of possible), so a 800 a month payment now isn't a massive burden (though annoying considering we aren't really tackling any principal) but the later graduated payments certainly will be a larger percentage of our budget. We are planning to take advantage of this 0% interest period go save a chunk in a high yeild savings account and pay off as much as we can before making a decision.

TL:DR should we refinance parent plus loans or federally consolidate?"

This Cares Act was put on all the accounts by Congress act , and servicers processed it as Forbearance , so it was Not a fault of borrowers to go to this status as it was applied automatically. 

Now there are contradictory news and even on servicers' post on social media and in their website that they might capitalize the outstanding interest prior to March13 on accounts after This Admin. Forbearance ends on Sep 30th which is definitely Not fair.

Lots of people on IDR plans , especially PAYE plan which is for people with financial hardship have outstanding interest on their account prior to march13 ... and since this Forbearance was automatically put on all accounts , it would Not be fair for outstanding interest to capitalize.

  Does anybody know for a fact that what will happen to outstanding Interest on IDR plans prior to March13  ( many do have these outstanding interest ) after this Cares Act Forbearance at the end of Sep ?

581,t3_g1j7ed,StudentLoans,How to best use 0% APR to pay off my Student Debt?,"Hi fellow borrowers and advisers! I was hoping I can get a question answered regarding a topic I hear credit savvy people use to pay off debts quicker. I heard it can be a smart move to utilize the 0% APR introductory period on a credit card to best aid in my journey to pay off my student debt. I've been reading and it looks like it can be pretty risky unless you are sure you can pay off the debt on the credit card in full by the end of the introductory period. 

Since it can be risky to transfer all my debt, can it still help to transfer a portion of it?

And if I pay off in full, is there any consequences to keeping the credit card open? I heard you shouldn't close credit cards, even if you're not using them, because it can be helpful to have that credit history still available since it establishes a line of trust."

585,t3_g1e4os,StudentLoans,NFCC certified counselor assigned to me says I'm doing things wrong?,"To start, I have about 100k in student loans and make about 35k a year. (I know that sucks but I'm in higher ed and the jobs are just not full time or year round so it's the best I can do for now) My husband makes somewhere between 2-3x more than me with no debt.

So my spouse and I have separate finances but we live together and have a child (and another on the way) 

My husband bought the house we live in before we were married. We live in California and have a high cost of living so expenses are high despite having one of the cheaper smaller houses available. 

We dont have a joint account we both contribute to. We both pay separate bills. He pays the mortgage and some utilities and I pay for other bills and do most of the grocery shopping etc. He doesnt tell me exactly what he makes and I dont tell him exactly what I make. We dont veto/ask each other about purchases... etc. Basically we arent comingling finances as much as we possibly can. 

We file our taxes as married filing separately. I dont report his income on my taxes and he doesn't report mine on his taxes. From my understanding this is all fine for tax purposes even though California is a community property state specifically because we don't mix our money or have knowledge of the details of each other's income.

When I have applied for income based repayment before (repaye would be a better option but I have ffel loans and havent decided if consolidating is a good idea yet)  they usually ask me to submit tax info, which I do, and then they (probably) ask if I live with my spouse and I say of course that I do, and then when they ask if I have his income information available or have any ability to get it, I check off that I do not because we dont share that information with eachother.

So that being said, we are doing our taxes ourselves this year for the first time since being married and the topic of student loans comes up and my husband wants me to look into if I am on the best repayment plan etc. I want to prepare  for and anticipate the tax bomb at the end of it and such ... so I decide to run some of the free calculators and contact the nfcc on their student loan branch to see if they have any advice on whether I should consolidate and do repaye or what... 

Well I was matched with a counseling agency and their counselor tells me I should have been reporting my spouses income all this time despite the things I mentioned above and that everyone who is married and living together for 6 months or more since 2015 has been required to report spousal income each year ... and additionally that there is some sort of cosigner form my husband should have had to sign each year before I could get on an income based plan (that doesnt make him responsible for my loans) as I mentioned I'm currently on IBR and had no issues.

I've never had the website demand my husbands info or ask him to sign anything so her reports just dont align with what I've seen. When I told her this she said lots of people have been caught for not reporting spousal income when they have to etc. And that the government loses X amount to this kind of fraudulent reporting each year etc... They did an investigation into it and decided to crack down recently... yada yada.... And that basically the department of education expects that if you are married and live together, then you have access to each other's finances and what you are required to report on taxes etc doesnt matter. Then she basically said if my husband wont tell me his income then I cant legally qualify for any income based repayment plans.

This is contrary to so many things I've read online and my own experience with the application so I didnt really know what to say. If I have to report my husbands income but he wont tell me what it is exactly... or if I convince him to tell me but our payments shoot up to an unmanageable level for our situation because of that... I dont want to assume she is correct if there is a better way, but it seems like the nfcc site assigned me to this one agency and (I asked and) she is the only student aid specialized counselor there... 

I want to get a second initial nonprofit specialist opinion if I can but I'm not sure where to go for that. Do you have any experience with speaking to a free nonprofit counselor regarding this issue?

I will be applying for students loans because my parents make too much for financial aid. When I called sallie Mae they asked how much financial aid I would need and I didn’t know at the time. Now that I have called my community college they told me that tuition is only $2,415. Although I am getting a job while I am in college I will need help paying for expenses such as rent, books, groceries,transportation etc. all of that in my calculations added up to around 11,000. Do you guys think that is too much for a loan by Sallie Mae or will they give me the loan? Also Does Sallie Mae take into consideration living expenses?"

595,t3_g161a3,StudentLoans,How should I allocate student loan payments during 0% interest rate period?,"Thank you in advance for responding! Any information would be helpful. I have quite the large student loan that I have been trying to pay back. It’s been extremely slow-going and I feel like I haven’t made much progress. When the announcement was made that the interest accrual rate would be suspended until September, I thought now would be a good time to attack my loans.

I was previously using the snowball method for paying back my loans. I would have a small automatic payment spread out between all my loans but then I would throw whatever extra money I had at the loan with the highest interest rate to pay that down faster. 

So now that things have changed with the interest rate and all automatic payments have stopped, here is my question: Should I make a payment spread out across all loans or should I continue to throw all my money at the loan with the highest interest rate?

Thank you!!!

Edit: I won’t be making payments right now. My plan was to save during this time of uncertainty and just pay a lump sum in September. I was just wondering if the payment should be spread out or focused on the loan with the highest interest rate."
596,t3_g19mmj,StudentLoans,"If I drop a class that was originally paid for with grad PLUS loans, do I have to send that money back?","This is kind of a confusing situation, so I will do my best to explain my predicament. I am a US graduate student in a medical profession currently living on federal loans - direct unsubsidized and grad PLUS loans. Like everyone else, my spring semester has been heavily affected by the pandemic.

So here's the situation: I am a full-time student but the curriculum worked out so I was originally signed up for 13 credit hours (rather than 15, which is full-time), so I was charged $1200 less for tuition because I was not full-time per my college. This was discovered and worked out awhile ago - my COA was less and everything was fine. Well now that we've been pulled from rotations, we were required to pick up another elective. This pushed me to 16 credit hours, which is full time. The school charged me the extra $1200, I applied for an additional grad PLUS loan to pay that off. I hope you're following me so far.

We had a mini-uprising (not really, but it's good for the drama) about paying more money to do less school, so the school allowed us to drop the additional elective. Now I'm back to the original 13 credits, and that $1200 was treated as a refund and sent to me via direct deposit.

Now my question is, am I obligated to give that money back since my COA is technically back to the original amount (which did NOT include the $1200)? I could really use the money right now, but I don't want to pay off my bills with that money and then the government turns around and demands I pay it back. Ya know? I have a LOT of loans (my degree is really stupid expensive), so piling more on top of it isn't really an issue. 

So tl;dr - if I drop a class that was already paid for with federal loans, am I required to send the money back?"
597,t3_g0f0jq,StudentLoans,Sign the #MakeZeroPermanent Petition Now to Show Your Support for 0% Interest on All Student Loans Forever,"This is the first time I’ve been “politically active” about something in a very long time. But I think now we have a window of opportunity to move the narrative on the topic of student loan reform. We need to do something about it now.

I think outright loan forgiveness is probably too difficult a pill to swallow. But I think we can get a couple of meaningful changes done right now if we indicate to our politicians how important this is. The petition I’ve drafted calls for 2 things:

1. It calls for the government to make 0% interest on student loans permanent.

They’ve already authorized it for 6 months. It would be very easy to refinance all student loan debt right now. They are doing this for Corporate America. They should do it for our students.

2. It calls for an additional 18-month holiday on ALL student loan payments so that we hopefully ensure a smooth economic recovery after the COVID-19 Crisis.

I really don’t see what’s controversial about this proposal. I think it just needs to get done. And for that to happen, we need people to rally around this cause.

So here's the thing, I'm currently paying around $350 a month towards my outstanding balance. Unfortunately I can't afford that anymore due to current circumstances. I contacted my school's financial offices,  and they told me that I have two options. Either I could lower my monthly payment amount, or ""reversing the payments for April and May to the end of the payment schedule"".

I'm not exactly sure what a payment reversal does; I googled it and all I got from it was that money was returned to the buyer, and I'm not sure if I'm the buyer  in this situation. Also, I fear that they will add the balance I owed for April and May to the last payment I make, which would be overwhelming. 

I'm currently leaning to just lowering my payment because the other option is too complicated, unless someone can explain what ""reversing the payments for April and May to the end of the payment schedule"" means. Any help is welcomed!"

613,t3_g0plaj,StudentLoans,Taking Advantage of Forbearance Period,"This may be a non-conventional strategy, but I thought it was interesting and a good idea for the current state we are living in. As almost everyone knows, all federal loans have had their interest brought down to 0% until October as well as many will be receiving a stimulus check in the next few weeks.

Like I am sure many people that still have stable work may have thought, ""wow this a great time to attack the principal of my loans"" using the 6 months and stimulus check to put a hefty dent on their loans. This was going to be my plan as well, until I had thought of holding off any payments during the 6 months, putting them in a high yield savings account until the period is over for extra security during this unstable time. If things were still stable at that time, I can simply apply the lump sum and it would be the same as applying it over time, as well as gaining a bit of interest.

Discussing this with my wife, she thought this would delay the date of our payments. Obviously it did not, but it got me thinking to see if I can leverage this time to reduce the amount of time we are paying for.

Background on my wife and I: 65k student loans, 2 years out of school. Living in LCOL making over 120k combined. Getting married last year put a **big** dent on our savings, and we are slowly recovering (Adding $500/month). Currently with a 3-month emergency fund wanting to get to 6 months. 

TL;DR

**Strategy**: Put any money that would go toward student loans/stimulus check into emergency fund for 6 month forbearance. 

**Result**: Freed up $500/month for student loan payments approximately 1 year sooner than expected, paying off loans \~4 months earlier than if applying funds during forbearance, while expediting completion of emergency fund.

I could technically afford standard but I can’t pay much extra if I do. I want to make extra payments that are allocated to principal balance after I pay my mandatory monthly balance. I’ve heard you could type a letter to your provider with directions to do this with extra payments i.e. do not allocate across all interest but to the principal balance of the loan with highest interest rate, and then allocate to xyz, etc etc, and they will do it! 

So question # 1:

I want to pick a plan where I pay less (income driven), so I can pay more towards principal balance in the form of extra payments each month. This will reduce what I pay in the long run, right?! Its making too much sense in my head, but I don’t know of anyone else who has done this or posted about it on the internet. 

Question # 2:

Would I have this option if I consolidated or would I only be able to have this option if I have multiple loans?

For now I need to pay only on the interest because that will capitalize when I start a plan no matter who the provider or what plan, correct?

640,t3_g08u1p,StudentLoans,What are the fiscally responsible options I have in this unique situation with financial aid?,"\[x-posting here from r/personalfinance\]

tldr at the end.

Here's the situation:

I am well into my undergrad degree and have had several complications in my disbursement of financial aid this year. My campus offices of Financial Aid, the Bursar, and the Registrar all seem very helpful, but I do not believe specific issues with my financial aid in paying for college have been fully communicated to me, nor have my steps for how to resolve them been clearly laid out or even communicated between offices. It's a frustrating situation that I believe will have a positive outcome, but I'm beginning to grow concerned about being put in a disadvantageous financial situation; especially with our current global concerns.

I transferred to my institution in the Fall of this year. I came into the Winter Quarter 4 weeks late on account of my financial aid not disbursing for Fall Quarter; the issue was that I had not completed the CSS profile, not known it to be a requirement for all students to complete, and not been able to complete it until 2 weeks after I called the office at the beginning of the quarter to register - only to find a hold on my account. I had received a few calls from the Bursar telling me about the balance and been trying to tell them that my financial aid should have already disbursed or been on its way, but I had not received any calls from the financial aid office to let me know the problem - none my aid could not disburse until I completed the CSS profile. Completing it required 3rd party documentation for my personal situation, so I assumed it to be an additional \*option\* for additional FA from College Board, and opted not to complete it out of concern for my family's privacy. Between finding out about the issue, requesting &amp; receiving documentation, and completing the profile, we were two 2 weeks into Winter Quarter. I wish I had been more proactive in discovering the issue and resolving it, but the quarter had already begun, and I registered late. The issue was on me. Receiving approval from my instructors and successfully enrolling had to be done in person and on paper at the Office of the Registrar and took another 2 weeks to finalize before I was fully enrolled.

This minor inconvenience was only the wind-up for the potentially severe issue I am running into now, bringing me to this Spring Quarter:

I went back and forth on whether or not to register for Spring Quarter. I had personal health and financial concerns about registering for this quarter. Between the financial risks of COVID-19 and everything else going on in my life, I still decided to register for online classes, only to find a near $10k outstanding balance on my account, when I had been informed by the Financial Aid office in Winter that the balance would be paid in full with the aid I was expecting; with a $2k return from the loan after payment (I'm not sure what the exact term for this is, but the balance was expected to be paid in excess of $2,000). Part of my financial aid, a federal loan, was meant to cover a majority of tuition, but the applications for it are canceled automatically by Financial Aid 4 weeks into the term for any students who have yet to register for 8 or more credits. My financial aid was completed and confirmed 2 weeks into that term, but I was not able to fully register until the mid-4th week because of some red-tape (I can elaborate on this more if anyone requests it, but it doesn't seem financially relevant, so I'm excluding it). This meant that an outstanding balance totaling near 10-grand would remain on my account from the Fall and Winter terms. Despite having been in constant communication with the Bursar for two weeks lifting my registration holds at the OoFA's request, the balance I was informed to expect full payment of would remain because most of the aid would be canceled automatically by the FA Office. I couldn't find a notice about this cancellation from the federal government or any office from the school. I was no longer receiving calls from any office for the duration of Winter term after registering. I would not have registered and accrued more debt from the term if there was no guarantee that I could pay for it; instead, I would have preferred to take the term off and resolve this issue so it didn't affect my grades (I was going to my professors' classes for the first 4 weeks, but not having access to Canvas for half the term ended up taking a chunk out of my GPA). So that's what I decided to do this term, temporarily withdraw, take some time to simplify my financial aid situation, avoid any other surprises with tuition, and come in strong next Fall Quarter (online classes are not good for my learning style, in any case). I thought I was making a sensible decision financially. Evidently, this would not be the case.

After seeing the balance at the beginning of this term and calling the Financial Aid office to see what went wrong, they discovered that one of my federal loans was scheduled to disburse for both terms, but never did. Knowing this, and not being able to register for classes, I decided to communicate the situation to my institution by submitting a temporary withdrawal until Fall 2020 and avoid incurring additional debt for the term before resolving the issue on my student account.

It was only after this point that I learned what I mentioned earlier, that one must be enrolled in 8 credits for any Federal Aid to be disbursed retroactively. It was only two weeks into this term that I learned my federal loan was canceled by the Office of Financial Aid two months ago without any institutional notice. I was registered for over 8 credits for the remainder of the term and could have corrected this issue with a retroactive disbursement had I known to ask for it, but now that I have not been registered, the deadline for a 100% tuition refund for dropped classes has passed. Meaning I can't simply lift the hold on my account, register for 8 credits, wait for my retroactive disbursement and drop the classes. Leaving me stuck between paying a 10-grand balance on my account, or &gt;50% tuition for classes I will not be taking for more than a week. I was willing to eat the monthly late fees and enroll for Summer or Fall term and have the aid disbursed then, but I have been informed by the FA office that the aid will not disburse unless I am enrolled in 8 or more credits this Spring Term. At this point, I will be missing more than 3 weeks of classes, at best.

I do not know how I could have communicated more with these offices, why I wasn't informed about this situation, why I needed to coordinate solutions to it in the style of a detective and messenger between all 3 offices instead of systems for communication existing for unique and unexpected situations like this one. Most importantly, I do not know how I can approach this situation in a financially responsible or safe way. This whole thing is seeming more like an impossible and unexpected issue, and I do not hold the offices totally at fault. It seems like an automated clerical accident and a lot of unfortunate timing. All I would like to do is take the proper steps to efficiently and finally resolve this.

My last hope will be to apply for a formal tuition appeal this week to waive the 50% fee and have the aid disburse before I withdraw. If that doesn't happen, I've been referred by the FA office directly to Sally Mae or Wells Fargo for a private loan... I never believed my institution could leave us so out in the cold like that. I can't take on the additional debt, it would be hard to swallow when we were expecting a 2-grand return from the federal loan after paying for both quarters. It's a discouraging situation, but what advice do you have for me? And what options would you recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Registered for classes 4 weeks into last term b/c of an unexpected issue w/ my financial aid. Turns out that's around the same time that the FA office cancels financial aid requests for students who aren't registered for 8 or more credits, resulting in a surprising 2nd financial aid holdup this term and a 9k outstanding balance on my account from a canceled federal loan that I was not made aware of in the 6 weeks I was actually registered to resolve it. My decision is now between a private loan to cover the balance or greater than half of this term's tuition for 8 credits I will not be enrolled in more than 7-10 days of - just to have the loans disburse retroactively."
641,t3_g02q4v,StudentLoans,Nelnet Outstanding Interest Capitalization at the end of Administrative Forbearance,"HI All, 

I have been reading the COVID updates for nelnet posted on [https://www.nelnet.com/covid-19](https://www.nelnet.com/covid-19). On 03/20/2020 there are two paragraphs that mention capitalization. One paragraph reads: 

""...when your loan goes back into repayment, any interest that accrued during the forbearance period prior to March 13, 2020, will capitalize, which means that any outstanding interest will be added to your principal balance."" 

Then right below this paragraph it reads: 

""Until further notice from ED, interest will not accrue on your account. However, if you had interest on your account prior to March 13, 2020, it **may** be capitalized and applied to your account balance at the end of the forbearance.""

I was wondering if there has been any new development regarding Capitalization of Outstanding Interest prior to March 13, 2020?

643,t3_g02gto,StudentLoans,AES Disaster Forbearance?,"I have undergraduate federal loans split between American Education Services and Great Lakes (I went to school 2008-2013)...I have a significant balance due on both (20K+ and 30K+ respectively, paid off a $11K private loan and a $5K public loan some years ago)  


Great Lakes automatically kicked my loan into forbearance, with no payments due and 0% interest until September - awesome! Because I have $2K accrued interest on the loan, I haven't even touched the prinicipal despite paying every month for the past 7 years. Now's my chance to double up and at least get the accrued interest paid off by September; my monthly payment in my income-driven plan covers monthly interest finally so after the disaster grace period ends I'll actually be hitting the principal with my monthly payment if I manage to pay off the accrued interest.  


However, AES is only offering a 90 day forbearance and stating that interest may still accrue during this time, and I have to request it, it's not automatically kicking in. Since this is a federal loan as well, I thought I'd have the same 6 month window with no payments due and no interest. I was planning on paying much less, if anything, to AES during the next 6 months and focusing on my accrued interset balance on my Great Lakes Loan (since my AES loan does not have any unpaid interest)

646,t3_fz5nvb,StudentLoans,Self-proclaimed PSA to high school seniors weighing expensive college options involving heavy student loan debt burdens.,"We're all obviously living in uncertain times, but one thing is certain, degrees are no longer worth today's inflated tuition prices.

Every passing semester, degrees become less valuable as a new batch of graduates enter the job market. This virus is mimicking the 2008 financial &amp; job market crash, but on steroids because *every industry &amp; every country* is affected *all at once.*

I highly recommend searching this sub for stories that students of the past have/had with soul-crushing debt loads (plus interest). If they could go back in time, they'd make different financial choices to reduce their debt loads.

The point I'm trying to make is to not repeat history by *immediately* going to a 4-year school, and taking on unnecessary debt (for the first 2 years), to which the 4-year degree is absolutely not guaranteed to land a high paying job after 4 years.

Keep your tuition &amp; debt load low by first going to Community College in order to get those BS General Education classes out of the way, then transfer to the school you want. Who knows, maybe they'll offer a better financial aid package *not involving* *~~massive~~* *loans* in the future.

If it's the social-life you're worried about, there's 2 answers to this:

* Because of this virus, now almost every University is moving to online-only classes and it's going to stay that way for quite some time. There's no point in paying 5 to 6-figures in tuition (plus fees) for a University campus you won't even physically step foot on.
* If this virus *wasn't* here, then nothing's stopping you from just physically going with your friends to a 4-year school on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights. Nobody's going to go around asking for your school ID, just to attend some weekend party with other 18-20 year olds. Besides, once they turn 21, those students usually start leaving campus to go to more mature bars &amp; clubs in the biggest city near you. So you're not really missing much in the grand scheme of things, except the debt."

651,t3_fzyc18,StudentLoans,Beneficial to put suspended IDR payments into a 529?,"For those on an Income-Driven Repayment plan, it might make sense to put your suspended monthly payments into a state 529 investment fund.

[Currently, all federal IDR plan payments are suspended, these next 6 months count towards your monthly plan even if you don't pay anything.](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/)

[This year in the SECURE act the 529 plan now allows a person to use $10k for every dependent they have a plan for (including yourself) towards student loan payments.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/020217/can-i-pay-student-loans-my-529-plan.asp) Some states you can list yourself as a dependent so confirm before doing so. That way you can withdrawal from the fund for every monthly payment until you meet your $10k lifetime withdrawal. Every dependent you have is another additional $10k you can remove.

A 529 plan is a college savings plan that [offers tax and financial aid benefits](https://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/name-the-top-7-benefits-of-529-plans). 529 plans may also be used to [save and invest for K-12 tuition](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/529-funding-strategies-private-school-tuition) in addition to college costs. Almost every state has it's own 529 plan and provides incentives to put money into one. My state allows for a deduction of up to $4k on STATE income tax. Typically there is a 10% tax on all stock gains, but you won't be taxed on this if it is going towards education or student loans. Even if you don't end up using it for education, then you can still withdraw from it, but you will have to pay the typical tax penalty as any other investment fund.

**Things to consider:**

* I am blessed and have not been laid off so I can afford to do this, and I have emergency savings to protect me if the COVID situation gets hairier.
* Some states do not allow you to pay for student loans. Check the state's rules
* You can buy a 529 from any state, even if you don't live there or your dependents don't live there. It's likely the state you pay income tax in has the best incentives for you. Do your research before deciding on which state.
* My state 529 plan does not allow you to withdraw from the plan for the first 18 months, check to see when you can withdraw.
* I do not plan on using this money for a while so I can let the plan compound and the tax deferral compound (My plan is until I get to my lifetime student loan withdraw limit or whatever funds match the remainder of IDR plan, whichever comes first)
* The plans are invested in the stock market so you can lose money if the stock market does not do well. This is a gamble. Based on my state income, I can afford to lose approximately 5% in the market and still break even. [On average the stock market returns 10% but this is over a period of 10 years](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/average-stock-market-return/) and doubles your investment every 7 years. 
* We are in a falling rate environment meaning even the best savings rates now are below 2% and I predict they will continue since the [fact the fed rate is predicted to stay between 0 -0.25%](https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitor). Savings accounts are not good to beat inflation, but they are especially bad now. 
* The student loan interest paid for by a 529 payment cannot be used as a tax write off. 
* Student loans are now a political issue and who is to say what regulations we have a year from now, let alone 10 years from now. All in all, this is a bureaucratic gamble, but that is why a lot of us did not privatize our loans and stayed with fed loans in the first place. 
* If I don't need the money, I can gift it to other family members like my newborn niece, or withdraw from it myself and pay the tax penalty."

Pros of waiting: 1) I can continue to make payments at 0% until end of September and maybe longer if that is pushed back; 2) chance of further federal loan aid may happen in the next year or so; 3) I interest rates could continue to drop

Cons of waiting: 1) interest rates could rise and/or it becomes more difficult to obtain loans at lower interest rates as lenders tighten requirements.

655,t3_fzvwny,StudentLoans,Need help deciding which loan is optimal,"Hi all,

Im currently a dental student who's managed to pay the first 2 years of school with money that I saved up. Now, I need to get a loan of $100,000 to cover the final two years. I'm trying to decide between a home equity loan, a private loan, and a governement based loan. At the end of the day, I obviously want the loan that will end up costing the least.

Can anyone advise me on what the best option is? My understanding is federal (6-7% interest) and private student (variable rate) loans have higher interest rates than home equity, but home equity loans (found one with a fixed rate at 3.24%) are not eligible as a tax deduction once I start making money? Can someone also explain what advantages and disadvantages there are to fixed vs variable rates and HELOC vs a standard home equity loan?

Out of all these options which is best when its all said and done? Thanks in advance to all those who help"
656,t3_fztdxm,StudentLoans,"Last Year of College, How Do I Save the Most Money? [Advice]","Looking for any and all advice. Obviously I can't go back in time and change how I approached college,  I can only move forward, finish my degree and then start paying these loans back. So here's a quick run down of my story so far. I attend a four year university, and will have to go this fall for a 5th year due to my major. In merit scholarships over the 4 years I saved $11,000. However, these scholarships will not renew next year as they only cover four years. 

Next, my school on average with cost of living included is \~$21,000 a year. So even just going off of that average that after this 5th year I'll be $105,000 in debt. Technically after my previous scholarships I will be down to $94,000 total in debt. All loans are my responsibility, so please don't reply below that Parent PLUS loans are not mine to worry about, because they are in my case and that was the deal I made with my parents. 

In my geographical area graduates in my major make an average $50,000 so that is a little comforting knowing I will be able to attack these loans when the time comes. This summer I will also have an internship that I should be able to make \~5,500 and don't know what I should use it for. Paying off the current interest on my loans? Tuition? Housing costs so I don't need to take out the full amount on my loan? Keep it in savings? 

Realizing how much debt this is I'm looking for ways to reduce this, or other ways I can save and cut corners or costs through this next year to try and get on top or ahead in tackling these. As well as after graduating. Currently I'm looking for lower rent apartments and also filling out scholarship applications. Also thinking I need to get an on campus job this upcoming year.

Also, sorry to add on to this, but on top of this 94,000 it's true that interest is currently accruing on these correct? Is that interest currently showing on my loans or will it all be applied once I graduate?"
657,t3_fzrh8q,StudentLoans,Hold off on 401k while paying off student loans?,"I am about to graduate college with $210k in federal loans (undergrad + grad). My employer matches up to 6% on my 401k contributions.

If I'm making 100k/year, and don't contribute my 6%, then that's $6k/yr I'm missing out on from my employer's 401k matching, but if I do contribute my 6%, then that is $6k in student loan payments I am not making that's growing at 6.6% ($400 per year?).

Is my math correct? I should keep investing the 6% right? I kind of just want to pay off my loans ASAP and not be stressed by them, and missing out on the extra 401k money may be worth the peace of mind for me. I plan on refinancing once the COVID interest free period is over."
658,t3_fzp7em,StudentLoans,I need some student loan advice,"Hey everyone so I am (was) a senior in high school and will be going to an in state university (which is also my dream school). As far as money is concerned I was financially insecure enough to receive the full extent of the financial aid my school offered. I did not receive in scholarships from them however. The net cost of attendance was $19,043 and this includes living on campus and my meal plans. With the help of federal loans, work study, and grants from the state and the government I only have to pay $6,043 out of pocket. Do you think this is a wise decision? With help of my parents I will be able to pay off the remaining balance without the help of private loans so for my first year of college I will have accumulated $5,500 dollars worth of federal loans and those have the lowest interest rates out of all loans and because of the COIVID-19 virus the rates are supposed to be lowered for the 2020-21 academic year. Just looking on some feedback and advice on how to procede forward. Thank you."
659,t3_fznivd,StudentLoans,Worth paying on loan during corona forbearance?,"I pay on an IBR plan and it barely covers the interest so it is appealing to me that I could actually pay on the principle for once. My current monthly payment is $226. If I keep paying that amount for six months it will total $1,356 which would take my student debt load down from $25,682 to a whopping $24,326. 

Until there’s a drastic change in my financial situation, I’m still not going to be able to make payments to cover much if any of the principle post-corona. That money would make a pretty good impact in padding my emergency savings or going into much needed car or home repairs, while paying down my loan still leaves it looking pretty hopeless. So is it worth it? Or would it be better to reallocate the money to somewhere it would make a bigger impact? 

Anyone in a similar situation paying during the forbearance or not?"

I graduated in the spring of 2018 but I still owe the university about $5,000. I'm trying to figure out what type of loan I to apply for to pay the remaining tuition. Should I do a personal loan? Or a student loan? I'm not enrolled anymore at the institution."
661,t3_fz8d0b,StudentLoans,Y’all. I’m 75% done.,"Good lord guys. I am so psyched. I just made a big payment towards my student loans. My current balance is $15,000. I graduated just last May from a masters program with $60,000 in debt... $45,000 paid over 10 months...

Over the last year I’ve distanced myself from so many simple pleasures. I haven’t eaten out in a year. I haven’t gone to the theater or even rented a movie. I have paused my seeking relationships. I haven’t taken a single day of PTO so that I can accrue/cashout. I budget every damn penny I earn.

It’s been an immensely sacrificial year and I am psyched that it is coming to and end soon. I believe I’ll be able to pay down my balance to at least $11,000 by the end of the month, but with the tax provisions in the CARES I might even be able to further push that figure to $9,000. 

At my current rate, I can be done by my 24th birthday in July. Good god. 24 and debt free. I am drooling at the mouth with excitement for what comes next. I know this is a bit of a boast, but frankly the effort behind this pride has my sole focus for as long as I can remember and is all I have to hold onto for the next few months. 

I hate this debt with all remaining emotion I have left to muster.

Okay, rant over."

669,t3_fz6hsu,StudentLoans,Re-Certify IDR Without Using Tax Return?,"I am coming up on my annual re-certification for my IDR plan.  In the past I've just uploaded my tax return via the IRS retrieval tool on the [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) website.  However, last tax year I redeemed a shit-ton of savings bonds I had forgotten existed, and my AGI went way, way up as a result.  Since my IDR montly payment is calculated on the basis of my AGI, I don't want my IDR monthly payment to go way up as well since this was just a one-time redemption.  So is there a way to re-ceritify without using my 2019 tax return? Can I just submit my pay stubs?"

I feel as if I pay off half now, it would be better in the long run because I won’t have a lot of interest accrued on my loans. 

I’m still a freshman by the way. I recently won a scholarship, which gave me a decent amount of  money, which is why I want too pay now."

676,t3_fyhxnj,StudentLoans,What would happen to my financial aid eligibility if I was forced to drop all 4 of my classes for this semester?,"I dont want to get into the whole story but there is this involuntary detox program in my state. It’s basically just a prison and people who get sent there have to stay for at least 45 days and have almost no contact with the outside world during their stay. 

I took an extra of my anxiety medication and ended up becoming really woozy and my father is somewhat convinced that I was on fentanyl again and that I had overdosed (or came close to it). I’m now worried he’s going to send me to that detox again (its extremely easy to get someone committed).

If I get sent there then best case scenario is I would be able to drop all my courses, which would suck because I have all A’s right now. Worst case scenario is that I wouldn’t even be able to drop the classes and would just have to take whatever grade I get after bombing all the remaining course work and tests. I know they don’t let you out of the detox temporarily to do literally ANYTHING, and I’m not sure if I would be able to have the withdraw papers sent to me to sign. I’m  assuming this would result in me getting all f’s or maybe d’s if im lucky.

So my question is what would happen to my financial aid eligibility if either of the above two scenarios happened? Would I still be able to get aid in the future?

P.s. I’m not looking for advice or comments about my life outside of the student loan situation. It’s been s really rough few months and I know I’m messed up so let me be. I’m ignoring any posts that aren’t related to my academic situation.

Edit: I would also be curious to know what effect 4 f’s would have on my overall gpa and my ability to transfer to a better school. I have about a 3.6 over probably 20 classes right now."

686,t3_fyivzm,StudentLoans,FedLoan's message.,"On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response
to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S.
Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your
federally owned loans that we service for ED.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The
changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020.

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan
(Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program
loans. 

If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the
servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options.
We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

● 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept.
30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

● Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period
March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on
your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in
place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period,
payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward
loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll
need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any
payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the
principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when
the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends.
There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed
on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly
payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of
the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept.
30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not.
To opt out, let us know through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""

● If you change your mind after opting out, you can simply request that your loans be placed in the administrative
forbearance again. Contact us through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""
● If you opt out and become more than 30 days late in making a required monthly payment, we'll place your loans in
the administrative forbearance again.

698,t3_fxwwzz,StudentLoans,Nelnet CARES interest rate update,"For Nelnet users, I’ve noticed many posts that suggest interest rates following the passing of CARES. I called them to get a better understanding of what is going on.

I spoke with a customer service rep and they said that “the system is going through and updating the hundreds of thousands to millions of accounts that we have” and that this should be complete by the end of this month. (For the life of me I can’t imagine why this would take &gt; 1 month). 

I asked what would happen once our account is actually updated and the rep said “the interest that has accrued will be subtracted from your account and covered by the federal government.” 

I plan to keep track of the interest accrued daily using a simple spreadsheet until it stops accruing and will wait to see that amount subtracted from my account."

700,t3_fyqu4b,StudentLoans,Your student loan will be forgiven,"The Covid situation, in my opinion, appears to be the pin that will pop many bubbles, including the student loan bubble. The 6 month 0% interest forbearance is just the beginning. This is a defining moment in our country's history, similar to the Great Depression. Major secular changes tend to happen not when things are going great, but when things are very bad. Recall that the New Deal, which introduced Social Security and other safety nets, etc happened shortly after the Depression.

Many of you who have been very good citizens trying to pay off your loans as quickly as possible will think this to be unfair. I don't disagree. But when times get desperate, it won't matter. In just four weeks, the US government has printed about **6 Trillion dollars**, mostly to bail out companies that made poor financial decisions (e.g., airlines that spent 96% of their cash flows into share buybacks that enriched senior executives, at the expense of a rainy day fund).

In light of all the money printing, the $1.7T of student loans outstanding seems like a drop in the bucket. The question will increasingly be asked - if we can bail out hedge funds who made poor decisions, why should't we bail out student loan debtors, who (for the most part) didn't engage in any bad faith? Additionally, this would substantially free all those making payments to take that monthly payment and use it to spend on a new car, a house, and other economy goods. It will be increasingly seen as a necessary cost.

What I'm saying is that this is the end of an 80+ year economic cycle, where money is redefined. A great debt jubilee is coming. Billionaire Ray Dalio talks about this, and I would recommend this video if you want to learn more [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

None of this is financial advice. Do what you want with your money. But in 5-10 years, you may look back on this post and wonder if anyone could have seen this coming. If you pay attention to the macro world, it's fairly clear how this all ends. Hedge accordingly.

Good luck."

My payment due date is the 10th every month and they said it would take a few days for the forbearance to be lifted. If I make a manual payment will that still count towards my PSLF if they are still in forbearance?

I also have no idea of how getting a loan actually works as I've never had to do it before, and I have no credit.

2. Because the forbearance is being backdated to March 13th, it should end on the 12th of the month, not the 30th. (At the very least, the suspension should be extended to October 12th.) This is to ensure that all borrowers receive an equal number of months of credit toward forgiveness and rehabilitation plans.

EDIT: Alternatively, instead of extending to October 12th, allow people to have payments refunded for the entire month of March (back to March 1st).

Basically, would I be better off saving up money to pay for my tuition straight on with savings or would it be better to use that money to paying off the unsubsidized loans and then likely having to take out a new loan to pay for the second years' tuition? The reason I say the unsubsidized portion of my loans is that, to my understanding, going back to school qualifies me for deferment and thus subsidized loans won't be going up due to interest.

My question is: if I were to convert them to loans now, would these also qualify for the CARES act coverage of deferment/0% interest while still qualifying as PSLF payments?  Also, I'm on the PAYE plan.  Adding these loans would not raise my monthly payment since it is based on income, correct?

I’ve been making regular on-time payments since graduating. And I briefly went into deferment at the end of the year and was scheduled to start making payments again this month today (4/9/20) . But, then Covid hit and my loans went into automatic forbearance. I’m fortunate enough to still be working during this time, So with the 0% interest thought it’d be a good idea to take advantage and start directly hitting the principle. (After paying all the accrued interest on my loans, ofc) 

I decided to make a overpayment on either the 25th or 26th, that was almost double what I typically pay to attack all my interest. I allocated the amount for each loan by adding the amount of interest owed to the monthly payment amount for every single one. For example, if my monthly payment for loan A was $25.50 and my interest on loan A was $30.50 in total I specified a payment of $56.

All the interest that was on my sub loans was paid off from me doing this but the interest on my unsub loans is still there. So I’m confused and Im scared that I did something wrong lol or that it will hurt me in the long run more than help and tbh, don’t know if what I did was a smart decision. It sounded good in my head at the time.

Thoughts? Or any general advice on what I should do now moving forward?

So fact: there was no full or partial student loan forgiveness programs established by the CARES Act. Any such proposals were stripped from the final bill.

There is no such thing AT ALL as a student loan forgiveness program you can get by paying a third party. No legitimate student loan servicer will ever charge you a fee for applying to amy program. The only thing you should ever have to pay is on the loan itself.

Further suspension of loans after September 30 is possible via standard forbearance and deferment options. You do not have to pay for this. No third party can offer you something beyond what your servicer does.

Under current federal law the zero interest period will end on September 30. This can ou be extended by an act of Congress or the Department of Education. This can not be extended by a third party nor by paying any sort of fee.

1) do these “$0” payments count as payments made towards forgiveness for PAYE

2) will the interest capitalize? I don’t want this to happen"
719,t3_fxv4h9,StudentLoans,"Student loans, CARES act, and the opt-out forbearance: pay attention to capitalization!","As anticipated after passage of the CARES act, I received an e-mail from Great Lakes this morning notifying me that my federal student loans have been placed into administrative forbearance until Sep. 30th and that I am accruing 0% interest. I have about $7k in outstanding interest from pre-March 13th when the rates went to 0%. Their e-mail includes the following statement:

&gt;If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance.

This is misleading. I called this morning and specifically asked whether or not my existing interest balance would capitalize, and Great Lakes verified that **it will capitalize when the forbearance ends.**

I told the representative that I spoke with that I feel like the statement in the e-mail is misleading and Great Lakes may be opening themselves up to liability. Waiting to see if that makes it to their legal department and if we'll be getting an updated e-mail.

Also note that I have heard from friends, anecdotally, that their providers have told them that their interest will NOT capitalize. If you are affected by this automatic forbearance, you should check with your provider to see what's happening with your existing interest.

If you plan to utilize the PSLF, this is probably a moot point since you only need to make ten years of income-driven payments and then the principal and any outstanding interest is forgiven. Capitalized interest will not affect your monthly payments. However, although I am in a career that makes me theoretically eligible for PSLF, I am personally worried that a future administration could eliminate the program. Because of that, I do not want my interest to capitalize and I opted out of the forbearance as I have the ability to pay.

**TL;DR:** If you have federally held student loans, your provider will be putting them into an administrative forbearance. Your provider may or may not capitalize any existing interest you have at the end of the forbearance."

723,t3_fxwq4g,StudentLoans,CARES Act and when being responsible screws you a little bit.,"So there seems to have been (continues to be?) confusion on the retroactive period from when the CARES act was signed in and March 13th date. From what I understand, any payments between 3/13 and 3/25 can be refunded without hassle. That makes sense. However, I had also read a few places that *supposedly* if you made a payment early, but your due date was during the retroactive period, you can still get a refund. This was my case. Payment wasn't due until the 15th. I made that payment on the 9th simply because of the way my paycheck falls. I contacted Great Lakes and the rep said yes, this would still apply. Cool, I thought. Was put on hold while she ""processed"" the refund. Then, she got back on the line and said that it was not eligible because the payment had to have been *made* between 3/13 and 3/25.

My issue is that in order to do this, the account can not be current and I must stop making payments on it for 3-6 months. I am not sure how I feel about this.

726,t3_fxdlnd,StudentLoans,90k in student loans.,"Hi everyone,

I just got admitted into a nursing school. However, it is very expensive with tuition being 60k for the whole program and 15k worth of housing for the 16 months id be in school. Additionally, I need money to live so I was thinking of living off of 800$ a month so about 13k for the 16 months. This means i would need about 90k worth of loans. I understand this is a crazy high amount, but i would graduate a semester earlier than planned because it is an accelerated program, it has a 100% NCLEX pass rate which is VERY good and the location of the school works perfect for me since my cousin goes to school in the same city so my family and I go often to visit him so I know the city well. Starting pay for nurses in Texas is 60-70k depending on the city.

My plan is to come back home, work for a year and pay  back my loans aggressively and once that year is over I would want to do travel nursing since travel nurses can get paid anywhere from 2-5k a week with housing included. I would like to add I would have my BSN by 21 so I am still very young which is why I would not mind going in debt since I do not have any personal expenses other than tuition and rent and personal expenses. My phone and car bills are paid by my family.  Would you guys go for it? Has anyone taken out a high amount of loans for nursing school? Thank you!"

729,t3_fxvb81,StudentLoans,Navient math just plain wrong on loan repayment details?,"I got an email from Navient that some student loans have been affected by the recent Covid-19 related legislation, so I logged into to check my loan.  I've been on autopay ($196.32/mo) for a long time and log in periodically, but I've never looked at the math closely.

Here are the details.  I have two loans consolidated into one monthly payment.

Here's what my account details page has:

* Loan 1: FFELP - Consolidated
* Balance: $5991.85
* Interest Rate: 4.0%
*Monthly Payment: $144.08
* Term: 72 months (3/2026 last payment)
* Total Amount Paid: $10,373.76


* Loan 2: FFELP - Consolidated
* Balance: $2171.18
* Interest Rate: 4.0%
* Monthly Payment: $52.24
* Term: 72 months (3/2026 last payment)
* Total Amount Paid: $3761.28

If you use the balance/term/interest for Loan #1, it comes out to a monthly payment of $93/mo (not $144).  If you do the same for Loan #1, it comes out to $33.98/mo (not $52).  So in theory, I should be paying ($93+$34) $127/mo instead of $196.  This would also make my total amount paid over the 72 months go from $14135.04 to $9197.28, saving me almost $5000!

I called Navient and the service rep was unable to explain to me why the math wasn't adding up.  She said that she could put in a request to have a calculation explanation physically mailed to me, but I'm not sure how quickly that request will happen, or what reasonable explanation they could possibly have.

What's going on here?  Are there extra amounts I'm paying that aren't shown?  Is the interest rate not really accurate?  I'm at a loss, and just would like to know if anyone else has any experience with anything like this.  I'm financially OK with the $196/mo payment, so my thought is that I should keep that payment and just be done with the loan much quicker than 6 years (just under 4 years!), or I could keep the lower monthly payment and save myself $70/month.

The federal loan is 0% interest and suspended payments for the next 6 months. The private loan stays the same. Friend may actually be making more on unemployment than he did at his actual job. If that is true or plays out how he thinks it is, should he just overload the private loan with payments in the meantime?

I have two private loans serviced through Firstmark, one of which i just paid off today, woo! My question is, will Firstmark send me a confirmation letter of payoff or should/may I request one?

745,t3_fxclgb,StudentLoans,When do my student loans hit my credit report?,"Hello All,

I graduated back in December and my deferment period for my federal loans end in mid-June. My wife and I are in the process of having a house built. My issue is that our mortgage lender will be running our credit in July to lock in the interest rate. My credit score is excellent, and I fear that it will drop significantly once the loans go into a repayment status.

My loans appear on my credit report, but they have zero effect because of my deferred status.

I called Mohela to see if I can defer another 6 months and they said that I have to wait for a bill to come in the mail and then they can evaluate my options.

   
 

To sum up, my loans ($19,000) go into a repayment status on June 14th. 

How soon after June 14th does my credit report show this change?

Will my credit score drop much?

   
 

Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you!"

748,t3_fxi5cb,StudentLoans,Best option for funding accelerated nursing program?,"My daughter will graduate from a major state university in May with a BS in HDFS and roughly $20k in federal student loans, the rest having been paid in cash by her mother and I.

Upon graduation she will be rolling directly into the fifteen month accelerated nursing program at the same university, at a cost of roughly $35k. This will be paid entirely by her, as we will be starting to pay for her younger sibling in the fall.

The federal aid package is fairly dismal, only $6k in unsubsidized loans offered. Frankly I’m surprised that with a sibling entering college she would not qualify to borrow the full cost of the tuition. The program is not graduate level so she does not qualify for grad plus. Also should mention that apparently there will be no federal aid available for the summer term because the program only schedules 11 credit hours.

It seems like our only option is to find a private loan and I will have to cosign, which I would do but am not really thrilled about. Am I missing anything here, and if not - can anyone recommend a private lender for this situation?

Thanks for any suggestions."

751,t3_fx721w,StudentLoans,Question: Voluntary payment of loans during forbearance?,"I currently have a slew of loans that are held by the DoE so they were automatically put in forbearance by Navient. 

I am fortunate enough to keep my job during this pandemic, so I would like to keep paying off my debt. The loans are a mixture of unsubsidized and subsidized loans, but I have already graduated. 

1. When I repay, do I need to tell Navient to take my loans out of forbearance or can I pay overpay them and it would go straight to principal after any accumulated interest? What is the difference? And what will this effect? My monthly payment would be approximately the same either way.

2. If I voluntarily overpay and keep in forbearance, is this the time to attack high interest loans or should I keep a spread similar to a minimum payment spread?

3. Is there any difference between repaying subsidized vs unsubsidized during this time? I have graduated more than 1 year ago.

I have 34 qualifying payments as a police officer.","I made the mistake of going to an expensive school, so I owe about $35,000 - all of which is now in forbearance.  My monthly payment is $80, based on my income based repayment.  

While it's only $80, I'm trying to decide if I want to take advantage of the forbearance, and apply that $80 each month to a credit card I have, and pay it down faster, or keep making the $80 payment so the loans get forgiven that much faster.  

I'm never going to pay these loans off on my salary, unless I make Captain or something, or marry a Doctor, but by then, I would've already made 120 payments.  

I have roughly 6 years left worth of payments before PSLF, so what's another 6 months at that point?  

But then, I just read on Forbes that 

""But according to the U.S. Department of Education’s recently updated website, each suspended payment will be viewed as a qualifying payment for PSLF, as long as it otherwise would have met the program’s requirements. If you’re working full-time for an eligible employer during the forbearance period, then each suspended payment counts toward PSLF. Additionally, unpaid interest won’t be capitalized during or after the forbearance period, according to the U.S. Department of Education. ""

Does that mean that I don't have to make my next 6 months of payments, but I still get credit for making 6 payments towards PSLF?  If so, then that's a no brainer to not pay."

Also, I'd like to start saving more for a house and would rather have low payments on the loans if it only means paying an extra 5K in the long-term, rather than totally cashing out and starting from 0.00 after a year of hard work.

755,t3_fxca7u,StudentLoans,What are the least terrible options for taking out private loans?,"Hello, I'm considering attending a second degree nursing program that would grant me a BSN in 16 months. These programs are pretty expensive, and unfortunately, the only one I got into is going to set me back about $60K at least. 

**Before you suggest applying to cheaper schools/going to community college - you can't get a job as a nurse in my area with an ADN, and I don't have much time to apply to other BSNs because my prereq courses expire soon. I was rejected by all the more affordable in-state (CA) schools.**

Since I didn't take out loans for my first degree, I do have $12,500/yr in federal loans available. I will be on the hook for the rest of the expenses. While I'll be living with my fiance to try to cut down on living expenses, I still anticipate I will need to cover ~$50K+ for the rest of tuition, books, fees, insurance, gas, food, etc. 

The good news: I've saved up about $60K for this, I'm really hoping it helps. I know how expensive life can get though, so I'm sure it will be a drop in the bucket. I plan on living as frugally as possible.

My federal loans are currently on the interest based repayment plan, which I had set up before I came to europe to study for a masters degree (which was nearly free here btw). Being that I had no income in the US and no income here as a student during this time, my AGI was 0, making my monthly payments $0 as well.

My concern/question now, is that now that I've been working here full time for the last 2 calendar years (2018 and 2019; I also worked the last 3 months in 2017, but the total income accrued during this time doesn't require me to file a tax return at all for that year),I was thinking of finally filing taxes (I know, I didn't do it for last year when I was supposed to, but I will do this retrospectively now).

According to the IRS website, I do qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion (FEIE) for both years. My question is, after filing taxes for both 2018/2019 with the FEIE (form 2555), will this offset my current AGI of 0?

757,t3_fx9vw7,StudentLoans,Question about CARES act,"Hi everyone, 
I messaged this to MyFedLoans but haven’t gotten any response. 

1) My next payment is due via auto-debit on April 10. Obviously I would rather not pay if we are getting free payments qualifying for PSLF until sept 30. I am hoping that they automatically will not take money out and that I don’t have to change anything, and thus they can’t blame me if anything goes wrong. My loans now say forbearance and my interest rate is 0, however it still says my normal payment due on April 10. I’m not entirely sure what to do. Did other people have a similar situation where it said payment due, but then it wasn’t withdrawn?

2) I didn’t apply for any forbearance, my account was automatically placed under an administrative forbearance due to CARES act. After this forbearance ends, will my accumulated interest thus far (prior to 0 interest from CARES act until sept) capitalize onto my principal? 

Thanks"

Question 2 - Is there a way I can direct my income driven payments towards the highest interest % loan principal? it seems like the income driven payments are going towards the interest and not the principal which sucks because my monthly interest is over 1k and im making payments that are nothing close to that.

771,t3_fwxp39,StudentLoans,Ways to get Fedloan to remove Late Payments,"Hi- 

I posted this to Personal Finance but figured this might be a good forum to get help. Sooooo rewind a few years I graduated from a very expensive private university a little over two years ago. I was unaware of how important credit is and repaying loans were. I made some money from my first real job- thought I was going to be able to not pay the piper and simply dug my head in the sand with respect to my student loans (private university loan and FedLoan loan(s)). 

  
After pulling my head out of my ass and trying to be financially responsible and being tired of dodging Fedloan and my school loans. I finally picked up and decided to confront my responsibilities. Literally nine months ago I entered student loan rehabilitation with my **university** and made accelerated payments to bring my account current. In doing this, my credit score shot up from 502 to 570, still waiting on Equifax to update their records as well...but should be in the same ballpark at TransUnion.  While I was rehabbing my student loans through my university, I brought my FedLoan current but having 2 missed payments amongst 13 loans equated to 26 late payments tanking my score in the first place (my fault...I get it). 

  
So now that my university credit report is golden, I've been trying to tackle my on-time FedLoan account and trying to either come up with a solution where they could remove my 26 lates from my credit report- making it seem as if they were never there. I've read about requesting a retroactive forbearance and also a Goodwill Letter to request to remove my late payments. Does anyone have any advice on how to get my lates removed with FedLoan?   


I understand that achieving a great credit score is a marathon, not a sprint- but I am trying and have made responsible decisions to get back on track!   
 Thank you all!!"

I’m going back to school this summer and then full time in the fall and was fortunate to have a wealthy family friend step in and offer to pay for my tuition for my final two years in full. I am going to get a job to cover living expenses but I am in need of getting a new car. I’m not familiar with fasfa or bank loans for students. Are these student loans typically checks? Do you have to make any payments on them while you’re in school? Do they track the money to see where it goes? I’m trying to figure out if a student loan could cover my car payments while I’m in school as long as I make enough at my next job to cover rent and food etc. My thought process for paying off my car with these loans would be to just help me build up a savings account at my own pace to pay off the loan once a graduate. Thoughts? Has anyone done anything similar or have any advice for my situation? Any tips appreciate :)"
780,t3_fwk8ch,StudentLoans,Fedloan forbearance confusion regarding PSLF.,"So fedloan emailed me today to say that my federal loans all have zero interest and are automatically placed in forbearance until September.  That’s fine, but I’d rather be making payments because I’m on PSLF and want to get this stuff done as soon as possible.  

But I’m confused by one paragraph from the notice:

“Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met”

Does this mean I’ll get credit for six months *without* making any payments? Or does it mean that if I choose to make payments despite the forbearance, I’ll get credit for them?"

785,t3_fwll8z,StudentLoans,Sallie Mae: Late Payment Help,"(Throwaway account)

Guys, I have a loan with Sallie Mae and I just sent in my payment of $253 that was due on the 3rd of April. But when I checked, it didn't say anything about late fees, it only doubled my amount due to $507 and said my payment was past due. I'm so confused because from what the contract states, late fees are supposed to be 5% of what was past due. Now they're saying I now owe $507? 

I'm hoping it's because they added next month's payment but the fact that it's saying the $507 is the ""Total Amount Due"" is making me think otherwise.

Is this an error? Should I just pay the other $258 accrued interest now?

I'm freaking out because my parents have access to my bank account. They're going to see I didn't make a payment and I'm gonna get drilled for sure."
786,t3_fwsvqy,StudentLoans,Cares Act Loan Forbearance and Public Service Loan Forgiveness,"Do we still get credit toward PSLF during the Cares Act forbearance? Does anyone have a source or information on how the Cares Act forbearance impacts Public Service Loan Forgiveness Payments? 

My gut says no because of how a standard forbearance works. During a standard forbearance you do not get any credit towards PSLF. Since my financial situation is unchanged by COVID-19, I figured it did not make sense to participate in the forbearance because it will only extend my time till forgiveness by six months. That only means six months of higher payments at the end for me and it sounds like I would be trading dollars for nickels. 

If anyone has information or sources on this I would appreciate it."
787,t3_fwom70,StudentLoans,Best Refinancing Option?,"Hi all! I currently have $43,422.61 in private student loan debt broken down as follows:

1) Loan Balance: $2659.50, Fixed Interest Rate: 10.24%, Term: 15 yrs

2) Loan Balance: $7181.95, Fixed Interest Rate: 8.24%, Term: 15 yrs

3) Loan Balance: $3963.99, Fixed Interest Rate: 5.49%, Term: 20 yrs

4) Loan Balance: $12.299.96, Fixed Interest Rate: 6.74%, Term: 20 yrs

6) Loan Balance: $3230.43, Fixed Interest Rate: 8.99%, Term: 20 yrs

I checked out the Splash Financial rates to see what they could offer me in terms of refinancing and they came up with the following:

5 - Years, Monthly payment: $ 826.42, Fixed interest: 5.35 %

7 - Years, Monthly payment: $ 621.93, Fixed interest: 5.40 %

10 - Years, Monthly payment: $ 472.33, Fixed interest: 5.55 %

15 - Years, Monthly payment: $ 367.60, Fixed interest: 6.05 %

20 - Years, Monthly payment: $ 287.53, Fixed interest: 5.04 %

I'd like some guidance on which of the above (if any) makes sense for me to refinance these private loans to. I'm currently working 80 hrs a week, grossing $72,500/yr with around $2200 going on debt monthly. I have an additional federal loan debt balance of $65,130, but since interest is at 0% temporarily, I don't want to refinance those until a later date but will continue to make those gazelle intense payments regardless. Any guidance would be much appreciated, and if you're able, I'd love to see the math of how you come to your recommendation so that I can actually learn!

Thanks so much!"

I called back a day later and another agent told me the same thing. 

My question is — is this possible? It will take  another few weeks for Great Lakes to report to the credit bureaus so I cannot confirm until nearer to the end of the month.

I lost my scholarship as a result of that. I decided to study something new and I’m now I’m studying Business administration with double major in supply chain and operation management and marketing. I’m doing soo much better in business. I started from fall 2019 and my parents are paying for my tuition now to help me to get through college. To help them I started working on campus so I can help with something, but what I make doesn’t help me to pay bills, rent, and food expensive. 
I thought to myself since I’m graduating in 2021 and planning to work in the U.S, that I would take a student loan and not relay on my parents. I feel a have grown and should depend on myself and take the consequences of my failure in nursing. I will be graduating with business degree in summer 2021

We bought a house in a high COL area last year and have about 380k remaining on mortgage @ 4.375%.  No other debt like CC for either of us.

Q:  I was *planning* on making payments for my fed loans as normal with now 100% going to principal instead of the measly like 15% that normally goes towards it.  W the forebarance development, I'm now torn.  Should I be saving up these funds for a bigger emergency?  Should I be getting this soul-crushing student debt balance down?

I will never be able to pay them off. I want to get them out of default. 

Considering consolidation or rehabilitation but my main concern is my credit. Will anything negative from these loans show back up on my credit reports if I seek consolidation or rehab or will the old negatives stay off? 
What does get reported after you consolidate/rehab if nothing was reporting when you set it up? 

I’ve been looking for answers but haven’t really found a direct answer if the 7 year credit reporting law applies or does it start over if you make new arrangements after it’s fallen off the report. (I realize that fed loans can continue to pursue collections forever and they don’t go away but I’m referring to the credit reporting status once they’ve fallen off)

Has anyone had their students loans cycle off their credit reports and later on did one of these two programs? Did any previous negatives pop back up? If they did start reporting again after you got into the program, what was reported?

807,t3_fvk73u,StudentLoans,Mission: Complete. I finished paying my loans!,"I finished undergrad with a loan balance that totaled about $8500. (My mother told me she would pay for undergrad, then I graduated and learned that she took loans in my name. She then said she would pay them back and didn't.) Most of the loan debt is debt I took in my own name, however. The short story is that I borrowed a shit load of money at 21 and 22 to pursue a degree (MLIS) with an extremely low ROI because a) I assumed I would always work for a PSLF eligible employer and b) I had no real intention to pay the money back in full. In retrospect, this was an extremely stupid and childish action to take, and it reflected my lack of life experience as much as my ignorance about the real world impact of owing so much money plus interest. 

After I realized my hellish mistake, I got out of the library field, into another related, more lucrative and employable field, paid my way through a second masters program while paying my living expenses, working a full time job in my field, and taking advantage of my in-school deferral to pay down my existing loans. Those years were extremely stressful, and I was pretty broke for all of them. However, the outcomes of those actions were well worth the hassle. When I started the second masters program in January 2016, I had 6 loans outstanding. When I finished in May 2019 (with no additional debt), I had 2. In November of 2018, I got an offer for my current job, for which I moved across country (again) and at which I got a 51% raise from my previous position. I threw all that money into the pit of despair that is Navient and did what I think is a commendable job with not letting lifestyle creep occur. Last Monday, March 30th, the final payment of $307.40 hit my account. I am now paid in full! 

It required a lot of drive and grind to get this done. In addition to always having a full time job, I worked a side job (one foot still in the library world). I have not owned a car in 9 years, and I had room mates for 10.5 years. I don't have any pets or kids, and I consider myself extremely lucky that I don't want either, loan debt or not, because I don't think I could have afforded them. I do not own property, and I have no down payment money saved. I cook all my meals at home, and everything I own is secondhand from either eBay or Goodwill. I churned credit cards to take vacations (including my loan payments, tuition payments, and rent), which were always done on a shoestring budget even considering the reduced cost, and I sold back PTO when I was able. This sub was a huge source of motivation, as were several people in my offline life. Hell of a time to complete the mission, but nonetheless I'm thrilled that it's FINALLY OVER.

Lastly, I downloaded the transaction history for my account but am not emotionally ready to see how much I paid including interest. The total principal of all my seven loans was $57,876. All of them were federal, and the interest rates were: 7.9% (Grad PLUS x1), 6.8% (x5), and 5.6% (x1)."

813,t3_fvwdr2,StudentLoans,From Navient,"On March 27, 2020, the president signed the CARES Act, which, among other things, provides broad relief in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for federal student loan borrowers whose loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As your federal loan servicer, we are contacting you to explain how this law affects your federally owned loans that we service for ED. 

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 

First, it's important to understand that the provisions of the CARES Act that affect federal student loans are temporary. The changes to your federal student loans that we explain in this communication will end Sept. 30, 2020. 

In addition, the interest rate and status changes apply only to your federally owned William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, and Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins Loan) Program loans. If you have other federal student loans that are not owned by ED and/or have private loans, you'll need to contact the servicers of those loans to discuss potential relief options. 

We've taken the following actions on the federally owned loans we service for you:

• 0% Interest Rate - We changed the interest rate on the loans to 0% for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be charged interest on your loans.

• Administrative Forbearance - We placed the loans identified in an administrative forbearance for the period March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. During this period, you will not be required to make monthly payments on your loans. If your payments are made through auto debit, those debits will not occur while the forbearance is in place. We will report you as current to credit reporting agencies.

Although you will not be required to make monthly payments during this specific administrative forbearance period, payments you would have been required to make between March 13, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2020, will count toward loan forgiveness provided all other qualifying factors are met.

Note: If you choose to make payments during the administrative forbearance period, you may do so; however, you'll need to make those payments manually (not through auto debit). Given the 0% interest rate explained above, any payments you make during the March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020, period will be applied to paying down the principal amount of your loans after accrued interest from other periods has been resolved.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO 

Keep this notification for your records. We'll communicate with you in August to help prepare you for Sept. 30, 2020, when the 0% interest rate and administrative forbearance period ends. 

There's no other action you need to take, unless you want to opt out of the administrative forbearance we've placed on your account. If you opt out, we'll remove the administrative forbearance and you'll be required to make monthly payments. Unless you want to continue making payments through auto debit, there is no advantage to you by opting out of the administrative forbearance. The 0% interest rate will remain in effect, and you will not be charged interest through Sept. 30, 2020, whether the forbearance remains in effect or not. 

To opt out, let us know through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US.""

• If you change your mind after opting out, you can simply request that your loans be placed in the administrative forbearance again. Contact us through one of the options described below in the section, ""HOW TO CONTACT US."" 

• If you opt out and become more than 30 days late in making a required monthly payment, we'll place your loans in the administrative forbearance again.

HOW TO CONTACT US 

We're available to help you understand this information. 

Visit us online at Navient.com or give us a call at 800-722-1300, Monday - Thursday 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., ET.

I'm also seeing that I am unable to make any payments on my loans currently (I think?).  Are we able to keep making payments toward student loans, or did the national emergency basically turn off payment for loans?  I am currently employed still, as is my wife, so we'd like to keep paying down as we go.  Is this possible to do in Navient, and I'm just missing it?"
819,t3_fw1njl,StudentLoans,How would you handle the CARES act with my debts?,"Hi everyone,
I’m just curious what my plan of attack should be for my loan situation. I graduated in 2018 with ~98k and have gotten it down to 72k (70 in federal subsidized/unsubsidized, 2k in private)

My payment for the 72k (there’s like 11 loans so I won’t list them all but they range from 3.4-5.7%) is low because I was focusing on paying off other things and trying to pay off my private loan. Since the CARES act is 0% interest, should I take the money I am using on federal loans and put it towards the private loan(interest is 6.1%), or should I keep making my federal payments and let it payoff some of the principal? Mathematically, I guess using the money towards my private loan makes more sense but I guess I’m just looking for confirmation from others to see if it’s a good idea. I feel like I’m missing out on some benefits if I don’t keep paying my federal loans."

So I have one FAFSA and one private loan payment every month. To my understanding the FAFSA loan payment and interest is suspended until September and the suspension of payments and interest is automatic, meaning I dont have to make any calls or changes to my account.

824,t3_fweeg0,StudentLoans,America's student debt 'crises',"I saw a post on Reddit that got a lot of up votes about cancelling doctors student debt, not the first I've seen but the most 'wtf' ones I've seen since from Google, doctors earn 3 times more than their Australian counterparts so $350k in debt for a $300k a year salary is nothing. What's this idea with cancelling student debt?

For context, I live in Australia, I went to uni and I'm in debt. I decided to take that on and when looking at further study, I looked at what wouldn't give me crazy amounts of debt. Hardly anyone here I've met cries for debt cancellation because we bought it on ourselves. But Australia has a system where we don't have to pay it back until we earn a certain amount which I thought America didn't have but when I asked on Reddit, someone told me the Government does have a debt system? I understand that everyone is not on this system but wouldn't a better idea to just be take on everyone's loans and do the same thing Australia does? The average American has 30k in student debt, I'd say it's similar to Australia, I'm going to be 44k in debt that I'll be paying for years. The thing is, if you did CS or medicine or engineering, even if your debt is higher than Australia, they make waaaay more than they do here. You can start of in silicon valley with 200k+ per year, that's like someone hitting their peak here.

Can someone help with my confusion? I just don't see the need to 'cancel' student debt, maybe some refinancing but that's about it which from what I've seen is/has being done. I could rack up 100k in student debt too but then asking for it to be payed off just...doesn't sound right"
825,t3_fw41nv,StudentLoans,CARES Act and Teacher Loan Forgiveness,"Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone else had this question or an answer to it too. I'm currently working towards teacher loan forgiveness ($17500 towards student loans if you teach math, science, or sped in a high needs district for 5 years and meet other requirements). To qualify you can't miss a payment during those 5 years or the time clock resets back to zero. I know this suspended pay period in the cares act counts for time towards PSLF. Is this true for TLF too? I can't find any specific official literature on this. I'm already three years in and don't want to risk going back to square one over 5 months of payments. I emailed navient but haven't heard back yet. What do you think?"

I’m not counting on that being approved, so I’m feeling a bit stuck.

Before applying through sallie mae, I researched other loan servicers. With the college ave prequalify tool, I found out that I don’t qualify for their career loan, so I didn’t apply there. 

This is where I’m facing limited options. My school does not participate in FAFSA, so my only source of funding must come from private student loans (parent isn’t going to fund me with their income). I could either apply with a cosigner through sallie mae, or apply with a cosigner through college ave. 

Does anyone have experience getting approved or denied for either of these loan servicers? Sallie mae claims they don’t look at credit score, but rather debt to income ratio. College ave does look at credit scores, and mine is good. However, I do have debt from undergrad and have not started a job since graduating in December."

It seems to me that if I do this, I would have to make payments for an additional 20 years from this point, until the loan would be forgiven, is that correct?  Also, according to the calculator tool, I would be paying $0 since I'm making so little right now... can I offer to pay a little, like $25 a month? What I was hoping is that I can switch to IBR, pay a minimal amount and then have the loans forgiven in another 6 years (which would be 20 years of me paying regular payments as well as IBR...) but again, if I'm looking at it right, that's not how it would work.

833,t3_fvo6x1,StudentLoans,Should I spend all my savings on going to college?,"Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college *and* to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually **not** a very good thing?

My boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me *before* I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to &lt;$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I *recieved* it in the year which would affect my aid.  

My feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.

• I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.

It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, *and* emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.

***
Grants wouldn't save you that much, my boyfriend could be telling me to spend 80k to save &gt;15k over the years right? I've no way of knowing how much to keep before its hurting me, or if I start spending more than I'd save in grants. What do you think the smartest way to use this money is?"

Just to give a little background, I have some debt for Great Lakes Loans and Heartland. I have been paying monthly since his January. I could be out of debt, but some people were saying I should pay monthly because it's good for my credit score and tax. With the CARES act, Great Lakes Loan's interest rate is 0% until September.

Look at what your account number is, if it starts with an E then you have the forbearance and if it starts with a D or a J then you will not. Their online site is not currently reflecting the active/accurate information.

I'm betting they have turned off the automated systems that handle the autodebit and generate the bills, but they're likely still implementing the code to reflect the 0% non-capitalizing forbearance.

846,t3_fus878,StudentLoans,Updated guidance for defaulted FFEL loans - COVID,"I'll update the stickied post too but for visability I wanted to create a new one.

The ED issued a new announcement around 2 AM.  Most of it applies to schools but what they did do is give the non-federally held FFEL holders of defaulted loans guidance to cease all collections until 9/30 - just like they did for the federally held loans.  The announcement is long and as I said most applies to schools so here's the relevant FFEL parts

FFEL Program: Lenders and Guaranty Agencies and Loans held by the Department Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements (§ 682.200(b))
The FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment the borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of six consecutive, on-time voluntary full monthly payments required to re-establish his or her eligibility for assistance under Title IV of the HEA.

A FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment a borrower fails to make as a missed payment in the stream of three consecutive, on-time voluntary full monthly payments required to establish eligibility to consolidate a defaulted loan.

Borrowers in In-School Loan Status (§ 682.209(a)) and In-School Deferment Status (§ 682.210)
The loan holder should continue to report to NSLDS as “in-school” the loan status of each borrower who was in an “in-school” status on the date the borrower’s attendance at the institution was interrupted due to the COVID-19 national emergency. The loan holder should continue the borrower in that loan status until the institution reports the borrower as withdrawn.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (§ 682.410)
Guaranty agencies must stop collection activities on defaulted loans until September 30, 2020, on all federally held loans. Collection activities must resume at the end of the period at the point at which they were discontinued. The guaranty agency must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Payments to Rehabilitate Defaulted Loans (§ 682.405)
The FFEL loan holder should not treat any payment the borrower fails to make as an interruption in the nine on-time voluntary full monthly payments within ten months for purposes of rehabilitating the defaulted loan.

EDIT - there was another notice that came out early morning - it gives the non-federally held Perkins and FFEL holders the OPTION of offering 0% interest and the cessation of payments for six months mirroring the federally held loans.  The notice instructs borrowers to contact their schools (for perkins) and loan holders (for non defaulted, non federally held FFEL) for more info.  I am hearing chatter that at least one FFEL lender is considering doing the 0% interest but we'll have to see."
847,t3_fv84bj,StudentLoans,Insights/opinions needed on repaying my loans ?," Hey guys,   
 

I got a job this year and planning to start paying back my undergrad/grad school loans.  I have \~68k in Stafford loans (where 3k is accrued interest and 65k is principal. I also have \~13k in Graduate Plus loans (where 1k is accrued interest and 12k is principal).   
 

Which one should I start paying first ? I am reading on the great lakes website, that they apply that payment to the highest interest loans first. Is that automatic or do I have to choose that option ?   
 

I am planning to set up automatic payments of 1k every month and maybe pay extra if I get more money from side jobs/tax refunds/family donations and such. Can I do that?   
 Also my company throws about 5k for free at my 401k at the end of April alongside my own personal contribution and their matching ( so I total about 7-8k every year of 401k money). Is it a good idea to take that money out from the 401k (and pay the penalty from withdrawing it ) and apply that amount towards my loans or no ? Is that a recommended strategy ?   
 

Also I keep getting this tuition refinance letters in my mailbox from Sallie Mae and some other companies. Seems like interest rates are lower compared to the original lender. Should I switch to any of them ? What are some upsides and downsides of switching to Sallie Mare or the likes of it?   
 

From your own personal experience, what is a good way to pay student loans ? What strategy did you follow?   
 

I would love your insights and opinions.

849,t3_fv07fa,StudentLoans,CARES- Employer Student Loan Payment,"I searched for this topic and saw a few posts mentioning it, but not really much information-

I work for a small business. My employer recently mentioned that he had read the CARES Act includes a tax break for employers who pay student loans for their employees (up to ~$5000). I told him I had read that too (but didn’t think my company would go for it). He told me to look into it and research the benefits to the company and to myself.

First off, I pay like $12000 in student loans per year, so this would only cover part of it. Also, when doing my taxes this year, I did get some money back in the interest paid. 

He indicated that the employer would pay me a lower salary if we were to start this benefit. I already get paid a pretty low salary.

I guess I’m just wondering if this would really make a difference for me and if anyone has any experience with employer payment of student loans generally or even any experience with this new law and whether it is difficult for employers to set up.

I read the following article to get started:

Current loan: 55K

Loan forgiveness date: 2032 (8/20 years so far)

Current monthly payment: $350 

We can afford to spend more money on the loan, but am unsure if we should keep the PAYE plan and pay more every month or change to the standard plan. Changing to the standard plan would likely increase the monthly payment significantly as well as incur some interest capitalization. 

 I tried using the calculator below, but the numbers didn't make sense or factor in how long my fiance has been in repayment. If I could figure out what a real monthly payment under standard plan, this would maybe be more straightforward. 

[https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator/r)

Options I see:

1. Keep PAYE, file taxes separately (probably better), pay as much as we can afford. Do this for 12 more years and pay the balance down so the taxes when loan is forgiven are minimal.
2. Switch to Standard plan and pay that amount if we're able to 

Should point out we have around 17K in credit cards we will pay off within a year prioritized above the student loan.

Anyone have any advice on the two options pros/cons? Anything I'm missing&gt; Thanks in advance."
854,t3_fus9tg,StudentLoans,New guidance issued for Perkins - COVID,"In the late night April 4th guidance, the ED also provided for some relief for non-federally held Perkins loans.  It is as follows:

Federal Perkins Loan Program

Borrowers in Repayment (§ 674.33)
The Department authorizes institutions to grant forbearance, for a period not to exceed three months, to a Federal Perkins Loan borrower who is in repayment and who is unable to make payments due to a COVID-19 related interruption.

For an institutionally held Perkins Loan, interest accrues during any period of forbearance. A borrower may request this forbearance orally or in writing and is not required to submit documentation to be considered eligible for this forbearance. An institution must document the forbearance in the borrower’s file. To receive forbearance beyond the three-month period, the borrower must make a request to the institution and provide supporting documentation. (At the expiration of the three-month period, the institution should examine the borrower’s situation to determine potential eligibility for an economic hardship deferment or unemployment deferment, as appropriate.) This period of forbearance is counted toward the three-year maximum limit on the number of years of forbearance that may be granted to a borrower.

Collection of Defaulted Loans (Part 674, Subpart C—Due Diligence)
The institution may stop collection activities through September 30, 2020 upon notification by the borrower, a member of the borrower’s family, or another reliable source that the borrower has been affected by the COVID-19 national emergency. Collection activities must resume when the period ends. The institution must document in the loan file why it suspended collection activities on the loan and is not required to obtain evidence of the borrower’s status while collection activities have been suspended.

Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements on Defaulted Loans (§ 674.2)

I'm graduating from dental school and the student debt is unfortunately racked me up to $600,000 at an average interest rate of 6.5% (Very daunting I know). I feel like REPAYE is my only option at this point, given the sizable debt that I'm in. I have a relatively good understanding of it, but I'm not understanding how the governmental interest subsidy plays into forgiveness after 25 years.

From what I understand, the government subsidizes 50-100% of accrued interest on monthly payments for the time you are making REPAYE programs. But if the loan is not entirely paid for after 25 years and the loan is subsequently forgiven, are those 25 years of government-subsidized interest payments then tacked back onto the “income received” thereby making you responsible for the remaining balance AND 25 years of interest payment? Thanks for your help everyone!"

I also hear a lot about loan refinancing, what do I need to know about this? I have 12 loans all with interest rates between 6 and 7%, is this high? Is refinancing the way to go? Can I refinance before graduating next month?

I know of a religious/charity based program that will pay off my loans for me so that I don't accrue interest, and then I just have to pay them off directly. However I think I would be required to pay them back within a short, set amount of years. Does this seem like a good option?

I’m trying to make the best out of the waiver situation, and not knowing much about how interest works etc. I want to make sure I’m going about it right. 

My plan is to stop payments on my federal loans (about 20k in loans, average 5.5% interest but a few are as high as 6.8%). I put about $480/month into my loans now. If I put that money in a savings account as an emergency fund and don’t end up needing it, can I dump it all into my loans in Sept before the interest starts back up? Maybe even put it just towards the higher interest loans to try to knock those down?"
864,t3_fu9jmz,StudentLoans,Non COVID related question - does anyone else plan on continuing to pay the minimum under IBR and pay the taxes at the end of 30 years?,"I have nearly $200k in debt from higher education, all govt loans serviced by My Great Lakes. I am single with no other debt. Under a normal plan, my monthly payments would be ~$2500. My take home is $5k/mo. Between paying rent in a high cost of living area, trying to save for retirement, saving for a home, a car, etc. that doesn't a lot left at the end of the month. So for the last few years I've been on IBR paying ~$700/mo.

Common advice from r/personalfinance and others would say pay your debt first and then invest in your retirement. But if I were to follow that advice, 30 years later when I'm in my 60s I'll be debt free with no nest egg and with less upward mobility in my career. It seems to make more sense that I continue to pay the bare minimum and take the rest of it and invest in my Roth IRA, index funds, etc. And 30 years later when my loans are forgiven, I'll just pay taxes on the income bracket I'm bumped up into which I can also save for.

Has anyone else thought of this plan? I'm looking for a sanity check and seeing if I'm missing anything. Thanks."

I’m independent from my parents, I’ve already became a resident in the state but the school refused to recognize it.

879,t3_fuhu2j,StudentLoans,My prospective student loan debt has me unable to decide where to go to college,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post or if my posting will help me at all, but I feel like I just needed to write out what I'm going through right now.

I'm making this post today because I'm currently a senior in high school whose having a difficult time picking a college due to financial reasons. Here is some key information about my situation:

* I come from a pretty low income family (only my dad works and he makes around \~40k a year)
* I will have to pay for all of my net costs for college through private and federal loans
* I want to major in business, specifically Marketing, and my dream is to work in the fashion industry
* I think? I want to eventually go back to school for my MBA

I currently have three options for schools: School A is my cheapest option (in-state school), and my net cost is around $10,000 a year. School B is my most expensive option at $37,000 a year. I have not received my financial aid package from School C yet, but I predict my costs will be about $30,000 a year.

At first glance, the answer seems obvious: School A. However, I was rejected from business and only accepted for general studies. It's notoriously difficult to transfer into the major you want, especially business. In order to be a competitive applicant, I'd have to get a near perfect GPA, be involved in 3 organizations, hold a leadership position, and take on an internship during a break, all while also doing my work study. As much as I'd like to believe that anything is possible with hard work, I can't help but think that I'm going to fail. I don't even know what else I'd want to do if I didn't get in. School A also has basically no relation to fashion, so I feel like I'd be giving up on my dream. I think if I went here, I would just be absolutely miserable.

On the other hand, School B accepted me directly into their business school (a top ten 10 business school). I was also admitted to their honors college, as well as receiving benefits as a scholarship recipient. I've visited and loved the business program, and they even have an apparel merchandising minor I'd love to take. Additionally, even if fashion doesn't work out for me, I think a degree from this school would provide the best job prospects in other industries. However, even with a scholarship, I'm looking at almost $150,000 in loans by the time I'd graduate. All my friends have told me that School B seems like the best option, but I feel like they don't understand what the burden of such debt truly entails.

Lastly, School C is probably my dream school. It's located in New York City, so I think that it would give me the best chance at making it in the fashion industry. They have a ton of organizations that sound really interesting to me, so I could see myself getting really involved and growing my passion. I'm also not a huge fan of big school culture (like tailgates, games, rushing, etc.), so I think School C would be ideal. However, job security seems less stable as its such a specialized school, and living expenses would be extremely high. After graduation, I'd probably be around $120,000 in debt.

I'm going to call School B's financial aid office soon to see if they can offer me more aid, but I'm not counting on it. I'm also trying to find outside scholarships, but I don't know how much that is going to help either. I'm just completely devastated right now, and I feel like I'm stuck in a trap. Everyday I've been thinking of everything I regret. I should've applied for Questbridge, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I should've applied to more safeties, but I thought School A would take me for sure. I should've applied to private universities that give good aid, but I thought I wasn't good enough. I wish I could redo my senior year. I think I know that the best thing to do would be going to School A, but I just can't bring myself to accept it.

If anyone has read this far, thank you for listening, and any advice would be greatly appreciated because I am so lost."

Once your eligible loans have been updated, Navient will notify you in writing, or you can always check back to this page for any related COVID-19 updates on your Navient devices loans.”

I have a consolidated unsubsidized and a subsidized loan that are both IBR and owned by the US Dept of Ed. 

1. My payments are in auto pay due tomorrow (4/4/2020). Do I stop the autopay on them? Or do I just pay it and then attempt to go through the reimbursement process? 

2. I started teaching recently and had not completed the paperwork for PSLF. I made sure to put my payments in IBR, but again the paperwork for verification Of employment has not been completed. Once I complete the paperwork will the upcoming 6 months count towards PSLF as well as the months prior? 

I am lucky that I am currently employed and can continue with my payments. But I would prefer to not make any unnecessary payments at this time to better utilize my income in other places. 

As of this moment I am planning on making the payments (4/4/2020) to insure that I have not “missed” a payment during the potential 120 consecutive payments to be eligible for PSLF.

885,t3_fug59y,StudentLoans,"CARES act, unpaid interest, automatic forbearance --&gt; capitalization after 6 months?","CARES act introduced and backdated to 3/13/20 to help borrowers for student loan debt relief. My take on it is that  all borrowers will have automatic forbearance x6 months. 0% interest during this time.

Great right? But doesn't end of forbearance typically trigger capitalization?

Example: Some of us have principal (let's say 100k for this example) and unpaid interest (let's say 33k)

100k (principal) + 33k (unpaid interest)

\-------&gt; x6 months of 0% interest (from 3/13/20)

At the end of the forbearance (\~9/13/20) if capitalization were to occur:

the loan becomes 133k (new principal) which derives interest from a higher principal (the 33k of interest now starts accumulating more interest).

Seems very unfair if forbearance is mandatory if this does trigger a capitalization event.

I was in university for three years and didn't finish. I do plan to go back to school soon. Since I've been out of school, I've been working full-time. I just started making payments last month. The minimum amount I have to pay monthly is $189.99. I decided to pay triple. I paid $570.00 last month.

So I doubt that the debt would even last the 20 years needed for forgiveness.

I don't know whether to plan on paying it back fully or to plan on paying minimum payments and getting it forgiven.

If it's better to bank on forgiveness then I'll borrow as many direct loans as I can but otherwise I'll do whatever I can to avoid taking loans.

Edit: I'm sorry if this post sounded insensitive. I have other loans that can't be forgiven and was just wondering if there was a way to make those loans easier to pay by having my student loans forgiven.

I have a lot of questions around this and hope to see further guidance in the coming weeks but my read is that say you are three months into rehab as of March 13th, you'd essentially get your loan out of default by October without having to make a single additional payment.  This is HUGE.  

What I don't know - which is a lot for this particular provision - is whether you can enter rehab now and still get that benefit and essentially only have to make three payments starting in October."

898,t3_ftxr5a,StudentLoans,PAYE vs REPAYE,"So, I know this has been beaten to death in some ways, but I was curious for some input on my situation. I feel I have a reasonable grasp of both plans. I'm a graduating medical student and my spouse has no debt.

Due to the size of my loans, we have to pursue an income-based plan since standard repayment plans are beyond our capacity during residency. 

**The debt:** 255k at 6.3%, all federal loans. 

**My debt priority**: pay a doable amount during residency (5 years) but then pay it off quickly (2-3 years) as an attending with the ultimate goal to pay my entire loan amount. I will still do PSLF paperwork (as I will be at a non-profit hospital) but won't necessarily count on that happening. 

My wife intends to keep working and most advice that I am reading says to go with PAYE due to the ability to file taxes separately and then only make payments based on my salary. This effectively would lower the monthly payments. 

Alternatively, REPAYE would count our combined income no matter our filing status and therefore have higher monthly payments -- but still have the benefit of interest assistance. 

**All that said -- and help correct me if I am missing something -- since I intend to pay off the debt and** ***not*** **pursue debt forgiveness then is there any reason that I** ***shouldn't*** **pursue REPAYE? This would allow the simplicity and tax benefits of filing jointly and still reduce the total amount of interest negative amortization that will occur during residency. Even if we pay more per month due to her working it all still is working towards our ultimate goal of paying it off.** 

Thanks for your thoughts and help!"

(I’m posting on mobile- sorry for any formatting issues) 

I’m in a bit of a predicament. I’m a college senior and like many other college students, I was sent home in March due to COVID-19. My school altered our tuition/room and board bill to reflect this change. 

Because of this, I got a loan refund of approx $2500. This refund was from my federal loans (subsidized and unsubsidized). I have approx. $52k in student loans (oof) outside of this. These loans are federal and institutional aid through my school. The federal ones will start to be due in November. The institutional loans aren’t due until June 2021. I haven’t graduated yet so I’m not sure what my monthly payment(s) will be. 

My question for this subreddit is: what do I do with this money? Should I pay it all in one chunk towards my federal loans the second I can, since that’s where they came from? Or should I split it over time into my monthly payments once they begin to take pressure off of myself? How can I avoid paying the most interest in the long run??

The loans I am being refunded are as follows: 
Federal Direct Subsidized Loan: $1,815
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: $659

Sorry if this was confusing at all- I’m still learning about all of this and navigating the “real” world! 

Thanks everyone! Any advice is greatly appreciated."

I wanted to offer assistance here for those of you who may have questions about your options, especially where the implications of COVID-19 and the CARES Act is concerned. The Department of Education is still sorting out guidance, however part of my job is to pick up the slack when loan servicers fail to deliver accurate info in a timely manner and I think that may be of value to some of you here. 

Additionally, there has been an explosion of scams and robocalls about student loan repayment options in the days since the CARES Act passed and if you take just one thing away from my post, please let it be this: your servicer is almost certainly NOT calling you right now. They’re still working with ED to sort this all out and have been told they have until mid-April to communicate with borrowers. Those communications will almost certainly be digital.

I’m 23 years old for context. I have a full time job (for now) making ~$3000 monthly. I have ~$29,000 in student loan debt (all federal) and currently paying $360/month ($30 more than the minimum). Also, I already have $3600 in emergency cash too (which should be enough for 3 months if I were to lose my job). 

I just opened a Roth IRA account (employee doesn’t have a 401k plan) and I can’t decide whether I should go all in on investing in the markets while they are down SO much OR double down on my student loans since it’s 0% interest rate right now bc of COVID-19 and I would be paying only on principal. 

In the long-run, do people think it’s better to:

A. Invest higher percentage of income into Roth IRA (put off student loan payment for this time)
B. Put all of money into student loans instead since it’s all on principal
C. Combo of paying student loan minimum and investing some % of income into Roth IRA.

I’m sure there’s not 1 right answer to this but I wanted to see what people think the best move is during this crazy time. Thank you so much in advance!"

916,t3_ftiu5i,StudentLoans,"Not sure if this is actually a loan or just a payment agreement, but I have a question about it","Ok, this may get long and convoluted, so I apologize in advance. A few years ago, my wife decided to go to college to get her Bachelors from a large online private “not for profit” school where the classes are done one at a time in an extremely accelerated manner of approximately one per month. A bit after a year (and having taken a few interspersed months off due to external needs), she reached out to Financial Aid to see why they hadn’t sent her expense disbursement (where they send you money for books etc) as expected. They came back telling her that she wasn’t going to be getting one, because when they looked at her account, she was actually going to be short about $1,000 for her current class, and that she wasn’t eligible for the next loan disbursement until after the next class, which they would require her to pay both the shortage and the next class fee before the first day of class, to the tune of approximately $2500. When she questioned it, she was told her 2 options were to either pay it, or drop out. Nevermind that (at least in our opinion) Fin Aid was responsible for this error, not us. I think it’s completely reasonable to assume that they should be keeping track of the finances to ensure that the student stays in compliance with federal student loan laws. In the end, she ended up having to drop out obviously, since we don’t have that kind of money to burn, and they adjusted things, and said that she owed around $1200 when all was said and done (part of the grants and loans had to be sent back due to enrollment level when recalculated). They kept trying to make her pay the entire amount at once for probably about a year, before they finally “relented” and allowed her to do a payment plan (of $150 a month, they wouldn’t accept anything less). We paid that for about 6 months, and then had to stop because we just couldn’t afford to keep paying. 

My question is this, without them suing her and getting a court order, can they seize our tax refund since it’s not a federally backed loan (again, if it’s really even a loan)?"

A private loan I took out in 2007 was deferred shortly after graduating in 2008. Long story short: My stepdad had co-signed for it, and I had been sending him payments while I lived/taught abroad, but my mom told me to stop sending him money since he wasn’t paying on the loans and was hoping to file for bankruptcy. Stepdad and I had a huge falling out afterwards. By the time I was back on my feet I wasn’t able to locate where the loan was. 

Recently my estranged stepdad sent a pack of mail and in it was a letter from that student loan (With American Coradius Int’l). They want to settle the debt. Right now it’s at $41,719.07 They offered to settle at 20,880.00 over 24 months. 

I want to pay for it since my stepdad is on the line for it as well. I’m curious if/how Coronavirus has changed the rules of negotiation. I’d rather not drain my savings, but if I could probably settle for half or so of what they’re asking, I might be able to do that while still leaving enough for emergencies. 

Do you think I could offer a full payment for less to get rid of the loan? I’m currently unemployed for the foreseeable future and I live abroad.

920,t3_ft9hy3,StudentLoans,My partner (American) and I (Canadian) both got emails about our student loans this week,"NSLS emailed to tell me they automatically stopped all Canadian student loan payments with no interest accrued until September (phew!)

In contrast, my partner was just “approved” for is a $224 USD monthly payment increase. It’s still not enough to cover the monthly interest accrued, so the loan just keeps growing. 

She phoned and was (thankfully) told student loan payments are also being held in the US without interest until September, so she won’t have to pay the increase until then. Sadly, she also got news yesterday that she is being laid off from one of her jobs due to COVID-19, so she’s losing a third of her income. It doesn’t look like she’s going to be able to pay the old amount, never mind the new one. I’m hoping they’ll re-evaluate her payments based on her new reduced income. 

Just to clarify, we have the same level of education in the same field (social work) from public institutions, so this wasn’t any kind of extravagant spending on her part. Just an attempt to climb out of poverty via education and do a little good along the way. 

What’s unique about her situation is that she’s a permanent resident in Canada and has lived here for 4 years. We’re wondering if it’s even worth paying the partial interest on her US student loans any more. There’s no hope of ever paying down the principle with our incomes. We don’t want to destroy her credit in the US or have them go after her impoverished mother who co-signed the loans 12 years ago.

For the past 1.5 years, I don't understand what they were talking about, until I read up on Parent PLUS loans after looking over my billing amount on MOHELA, that they were talking about the PLUS loans. 

I have brought up to my mother that PLUS loans can't be transferred unless it's done through a private lending company, and she is convinced otherwise. I don't intend on accepting a transfer loan when I've never had to go private as a result of my own work, and I didn't necessarily ""earn"" that potential interest rate, since most of my loans are all between 5-7%. 

I'm not sure what to do, since this is going to come to a head at some point. Honestly I feel pretty salty since over the past 4 years, I have slowly started to realize through my personal finance class that my parents did not prepare for my college funding, as my dad wasn't involved in the process and my mother had to figure everything out, and I'd much rather not have to account for this extra 8k, because if my parents had worked together to do a better job of preparing for this, we likely wouldn't be in this scenario in the first place.

EDIT: I seem to have come off much more whiny than I meant  when I originally posted this. The main gripe is the fact that I don't have a say or a discussion, I'm just being told what to do with no prior discussion with my parents, even though this is something that impacts my future finances. 

To be clear, I don't have an issue helping to pay the 8k, but my main concern is that my parents are being dismissive and not actually considering my word when this directly affects me, so I don't know how to approach them with alternatives than just refinancing."

934,t3_fs7pxj,StudentLoans,I work for a Federal Student Loan Servicer. To give you guys an idea.,"It's all pretty chaotic. Here's what we know for a fact. All ***ED*** loan accounts, are eligible for a COVID forbearance to be placed on the account until September. ***ALL*** ED loan accounts will have a 100% interest subsidy that is backdated from 3/13/20 until 9/30/20.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things that have been conveyed to us by FSA. Any and all payments made to student loan accounts ***AFTER*** 3/13/20 will be recalculated by our accounting teams once they backdate the interest to make it look like the payment was made on an account that accrued ***NO*** interest after 3/13/20. Meaning the only interest between your payment and principle balance will be interest from before that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't speak for exact dates, but expect it not to show up for a majority of people until April. Again, it ***WILL*** backdate as of right now. That's been mandated by FSA and unless THEY change it, it will update. However, there are tens of millions of accounts and quite a few of these changes have to be done manually.

Another thing to please keep in mind. FSA only just decided ***HOW*** it wanted this done, for us as servicers, last Friday. So in the midst of trying to get as many call center workers to work from home(which adds it's own troubles. Bad internet, tech problems, tech illiterate people, etc ) their trying to still keep our guys working as smoothly as possible to set this all up. As someone who also has student loans (fedloans/PHEAA) I know how frustrating this type of chaos can be, but please try to understand it's just as chaotic for the other side. Information is updating daily and it's all pretty break-neck speed for people. ***ESPECIALLY*** the call center new-hires who just started before this. I have some who report to me that I've spent hours trying to reinforce to make sure they can smoothly handle this, and it's caused a few to quit from the stress and frustration and tensions this entire thing is bringing.

It's rough for everyone, so try to hang in there guys and stay safe and healthy as possible :x  


  
Edit\* Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much traffic! I'll try replying to who I can, I posted this before going to bed ahah."
935,t3_fsq98o,StudentLoans,Should I increase my gov't loan payments to reduce principal or ride them out?,"I only have gov't loans, and my plan was originally to ride them out for the duration of my 10 year payment plan being that the interest rates were between 3.5-4.7%. However, now that interest rates are 0%, should I increase my payments to pay my loans off faster?

Riding them out means more cash on hand, and more to invest. However, at the same time, I feel like I should capitalize on the 0% 

  
Thoughts?"
936,t3_fspnqp,StudentLoans,Income-based repayment and tax filing status,"I am graduating from professional school this coming May, and will likely apply for an income-based repayment plan for my student loans. Because I had zero income this past year, I was hoping that once I sign up for a plan, my first year payments will be $0, while still having those payments count towards eventual forgiveness of my loans. I was told by my school that I should file my taxes this year even though I had no income, so my payments would be $0 for the first year. My problem is, my mom ended up claiming me as a dependent when filing her taxes at the advice of her accountant.... I didn’t know she did this until recently when I was getting my tax documents ready. How will this effect my student loan payments? Will it go off her income or mine? I also want to mention that all my loans (both undergrad and grad loans) are under my name, and I’m not expecting my parents to help pay for my loans. All loans are federal loans as well."
937,t3_fsi65y,StudentLoans,Sallie Mae's COVID-19 relief is an absolute JOKE. What should I do?,"In response to the pandemic, Sallie Mae is offering all (or most?) borrowers 3 months of ""emergency forbearance."" When I asked how this differs from regular forbearance, the rep said ""It doesn't count toward your 12 month forbearance maximum."" ""So it still accrues interest through the 3 month period?"" ""Yes."" 

I'm one of the folks who's fortunate enough to be working remotely. However, my income relies heavily on commission, and I'm an advertising sales consultant. Companies simply don't want to market right now, and as a result, my commission is pretty much nonexistent. Due to that, I can't afford my April loan payments. 

For those who are familiar with Sallie Mae, do I have any other options? I'm currently in a bit of a panic."
938,t3_fsmpmv,StudentLoans,Student Loans Disappeared?,"I know federal student loans don’t disappear really, but damnit if I can’t find them!

Backstory: 18 year ago, I got student loans (Perkins) and was going to college... during that, I knocked up my girlfriend (very stupid, I know!) and I wound up dropping out of college and getting a crap job to support them and marry my girlfriend. My wife didn’t believe in loans or credit (some kind of religious thing) and we rented and paid cash for everything. Then 2 years ago, we got divorced and I signed up to CreditKarma and AnnualCreditReport.com to view my credit, expecting to see all these non-paid student loans... but my credit report was blank! I don’t have credit cards or loans and I don’t default on my utilities or insurance... so I decided to go onto StudentAid.gov and a few other federal sites to try and find the loans... nothing! I entered the FSA username and email address from back then and it said it couldn’t be found. 

I usually owe a few hundred by tax time, so they’ve never tried to garnish any tax returns since I don’t get any... and they’ve never tried to contact me, email me, call me or try and do paycheck garnishments. So i’m really wondering what happened to them and where they went?

I know anything from that long ago wouldn’t be on my credit reports because it was over 7 years ago, but you’d think they would try to find me. 

18 years ago, the balance was $12,000... i’m not sure what it would even amount to now. I want to start paying them off because well, i’m rid of the crazy religious nut and I want to better my future and I don’t like having debt looming out there somewhere. I borrowed it, I owe it and I intend to pay it back. 

Any ideas where or why they disappeared from existence and why no one tried to find me or collect on them?

TL;DR - Took out federal student loans, haven’t paid on them in 18 years because I was married to a no credit/loan believing in religious nut, got divorced, loans aren’t on my credit reports or studentaid.gov and they’ve never tried to collect."
939,t3_fspz7t,StudentLoans,Student loan without a co-signer,"I know it’s damn near impossible to find a private lender that doesn’t need a co-signer but I just wanted to take a gander and see if anybody had to go through the same situation.

I don’t have anyone that can co-sign me so I’m on my own. I’ve already got the federal loan but it’s not enough like 2.5-3k per semester is missing. I’ve looked into private loans and I haven’t come across one that doesn’t require a co-signer. To make matters worse, my credit is also poor. At this point if there’s one private lender with a high interest rate I’ll take it if it means I can go to school. I just need something.

Please, if anyone could give me some ideas here it would be greatly appreciated."
940,t3_fs4nvr,StudentLoans,Give them some time on the covid stuff folks,"I get that people are anxious..I really do..bit we need to give the feds and servicers some time to implement this stuff.  Yes the websites mostly all still.reflect the march 13th language.. they will get updated.  Yes some of the call center staff aren't fully trained yet on the new law...they will also get sorted.  I'm sure we will.start seeing updates by the end of the week.

Unless you have autopay due this week there's no reason to call.  If your loans are eligible for the waivers they will be applied automatically and your autopay should stop.  

I will update as soon as things progress but no news does not mean bad news."
941,t3_fssycm,StudentLoans,US Address While Living Abroad,"I'm currently living outside of the US, but use my parents' home as my address in the US. (I lived with them long term before I left, so not a big deal while transitioning.) BUT my parents have since moved. 

Do I update my address on my loans to that address or to my address here in my new country?"
942,t3_fssh2h,StudentLoans,What’s a manageable amount of debt?,"Hey everyone. I’m looking to move on campus this upcoming fall, and the pricing is astronomical. I have the option to stay home for free and commute- this is not ideal for me as I’ll be driving 1hr to get to campus 2-3 days a week. Or I could take out a private loan to secure on campus housing. 

Student housing for a year would be around $12,000.

Based on what I’ve paid in tuition and fees so far, if I stayed at home I would have approximately $25-30k in student when I graduate. 

If I stayed on campus for my final two years, my student loan would be double that (50-60k). My question is what is a manageable amount of debt to accrue? I don’t want to be paying on these loans for the rest of my life, or take several years to make noticeable dents in the principal amount. 

I’m a dual major for HR and PR, looking at a post graduate job in Dallas, TX if that makes a difference."
943,t3_fshxsi,StudentLoans,The freeze on interest and payments let me get a really good look at my loan progress.,"And I want to f\*cking cry.

I have a loan with an original principle of $872.  After making payments on it for SIX YEARS! SIX! 6! I owe $879 on that loan.

I'm on IBR, and I pay a bit more each month than I have to.... not a lot, but I'm not paying just the minimum.

I just feel so disheartened.  Like... what's the point?"
944,t3_fsf619,StudentLoans,Will your credit score decrease if you don't repay back loans during suspension?,"So I read all federal student loans will be suspended, but when I logged on to my account to see my balance it now says 0% interest rate, but my payment due date remains the same. Im currently still in my grace period so I haven't paid anything yet, but I was wondering if it would effect my credit score if I continued not to pay."
945,t3_fsrodw,StudentLoans,Sallie Mae sent me an email today saying my 1098-E form is incorrect.,"Hello all!
I received an email today from Sallie Mae saying the 1098-E form that was sent to me in late January had an incorrect amount. They've sent an updated 1098-E and I've confirmed via the website that this is true and that I've paid a significant amount more in interest. The fun part is I've already filed my taxes and received monies in return. 
I should be keeping track of how much I pay in interest on all my loans to prevent this horrendous miscalculation from happening again. Has this happened to anyone before?
What do now?"
946,t3_fsgtwz,StudentLoans,Coronavirus Student Loan Tricks,"I know a lot of the details are still fuzzy but does anyone have any cool tricks they are using given the changes to student loans from the coronavirus.

Personally I no longer see the point of paying any amount on student loans right now since they aren't accruing interest until September. Don't see why I wouldn't take the money I was going towards student loans, put it in a high-interest savings account (like Marcus - 1.7% interest) and pay all that at once in September. 

I know this is pretty minor but am wondering if anyone else plans to do anything out of the ordinary"
